1a67bcd2-4be4-4221-ab02-0cea41c74809," What kind of interests were created by Dana's conveyance and why? The interests created by Dana's conveyance may be construed as ambiguous. She used both conditional, provided that, and durational only so long as, language in her conveyance. The rules of construction favor a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) over a fee simple determinable (FSD). It can be argued that Dana created a fee simple subject to condition sbusequent. Dana conveyed Eve, Blackacre provided that Eve did not sell the house because Dana, in her conveyance explicitly states"" provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house. The house is not to be sold."" Fiona will claim that Dana either created a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because the condition is that the house remains Eve's if she does not attempt to sell the house. Fiona will further claim that Dana's conveyance of personal property to her provides Fiona with an future interest to Blackacre. 2. Eve's arguments to be permitted to solicit other offer for the sale of Blackacre. The issue here is whether Eve should be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre. Dana's conveyance of Blackacre to Eve is ambiguous. It is unclear if Dana wished to convey a life estate to her cousin Eve, using language similar to that of the White case, ""this house is not to be sold."" In the White case, Evelyn White had been left a home with similar conditions, ""this house is not to be sold."" In that case, White's daughter, similarly inherited all of personal property. Unlike the White case, cousins who had not been close to White wanted the property and claimed that White had a life estate. The deceased could have indicated her intent to leave the estate as a life estate with future beneficiaries, she did not do so. The majority used the rules of construction in order to interpret the ambiguous conveyance language. Under the rules of construction, conveyances should be interpreted to (1) favor the intent of the grantor (2) favor a FSA; (3) the alienability of the property; (4) favor a FSSCS over an FSD; (5) to avoid partial sold."" In that case, White's daughter, similarly inherited all of personal property. Unlike the White case, cousins who had not been close to White wanted the property and claimed that White had a life estate. The deceased could have indicated her intent to leave the estate as a life estate with future beneficiaries, she did not do so. The majority used the rules of construction in order to interpret the ambiguous conveyance language. Under the rules of construction, conveyances should be interpreted to (1) favor the intent of the grantor (2) favor a FSA; (3) the alienability of the property; (4) favor a FSSCS over an FSD; (5) to avoid partial intestacy; (6) favor vested over contigent interests; (7) read the document in its entitrey to assure that the document is reasonably consistent. In White, the majority found that rules of construction favored an FSA over a life estate, and although the intent of the grantor was not to sell the property, rules of construction support alienability of the property. Eve should similarly argue that she owns the property in fee simple absolute which would allow her complete control over the property, that it is alienable, devisable and inheritable. Rules of Construction favor an FSA over a life estate, and they favor the alienability of the property, thereby not imposing the restrictions that Dana's conveyance seem to imply, ""this house is not to be sold."" Furthermore, Eve should argue that the intent of the conveyance was done to leave Blackacre to Eve since Fiona, according to the fact pattern, told her mother Dana that she had no interest in returning to New Suffolk. Dana wanted to keep Blackacre in her family so she conveyed the property to Eve, who had lived with Dana at Blackacrre when Eve's parents had died. Had Dana intended to leave Fiona Blackacre, Dana's intent would clearly have been made in the conveyance. Eve, as a property owner in fsa, would be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre. Eve can argue that she no longer can live there since the death of her cousin, who she grew up with. And if Eve was to share property interests with Fiona as a future interest holder, she could claim the state of Blackacre was deterioration through no fault of her own, just the nature wear and tear of a cold New Suffolk winter while she was in mourning. In Baker v. Wheedon (Anna - LE), deterioration / waste was not the sole deciding factor, but rather the best interests of parties. Best interest of the parties could be the financial distress of one (Anna Wheedon could not longer work the farm to pay taxes); the sentimental value; long-standing ownership, etc. and Fiona is a future interest holder. They may Furthermore, even if Eve would like to sell the property, use the Unified Partition of Heirs Property Act to find a fair market value and buy out process for the family member, Fiona, that does not want to sell the property. New Suffolk winter while she was in mourning. In Baker v. Wheedon (Anna - LE), deterioration / waste was not the sole deciding factor, but rather the best interests of parties. Best interest of the parties could be the financial distress of one (Anna Wheedon could not longer work the farm to pay taxes); the sentimental value; long-standing ownership, etc. Furthermore, even if Eve would like to sell the property, and Fiona is a future interest holder. They may use the Unified Partition of Heirs Property Act to find a fair market value and buy out process for the family member, Fiona, that does not want to sell the property. 3. Fiona as a future interest holder. Fiona arguments to reclaim ownership of Blackacre and/or for holding Eve accountable for the repairs needed on Blackacre. The issue here is whether Fiona has an interest in Blackacre based on Dana's conveyance. Fiona may argue that Dana conveyed Eve Blackacre on the condition that Eve did not sell the house because Dana, in her conveyance explicitly states"" provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house. The house is not to be sold."" Fiona will claim that Dana either created a fee simple subject to condition subsequent providing Fiona with an executory interest. Furthermore, Fiona may use Dana's conveyance of Dana's personal property to Fiona as further proof of Fiona's future interest in the property, claiming that Dana did in fact intend to leave Fiona, her daughter, the property. Fiona may also claim, similar to the relatives in the White case, that Eve only has a life estate interest in Blackacre. If Fiona has future interest in the estate, Fiona can hold Eve accountable for the reparis needed on Blackacre. Future interest holders interests in the property are to be maintained. Presentory interest holders have a duty to repair the estate, pay taxes and not commit waste. There are three types of waste that a present interest holder may not commit: affirmative waste, voluntary and injurious acts that may devalue a property; permissive waste, negligent acts of a lesee to not provide reasonable property upkeep (this may include not paying taxes); ameliorative waste, the act of improving property. There is also economic waste, actions that make the property less productive. In this case, although Eve has been paying taxes on auto-pay, Fiona may claim that Eve has not taken care of her duty to complete basic care on the estate, and committed permissive waste, neglecting the property not providing reasonable care resulting in possible a bad roof (with missing shingles); cracked glass and other serious problems the fact pattern alludes to. If Fiona indeed has a future interest, she and upkeep to Blackacre for future interest can argue that Eve is responsible for the cost of repair holders such as herself. In this case, although Eve has been paying taxes on auto-pay, Fiona may claim that Eve has not taken care of her duty to complete basic care on the estate, and committed permissive waste, neglecting the property not providing reasonable care resulting in possible a bad roof (with missing shingles); cracked glass and other serious problems the fact pattern alludes to. If Fiona indeed has a future interest, she can argue that Eve is responsible for the cost of repair and upkeep to Blackacre for future interest holders such as herself. Support of an FSCSS Although Eve may claim that she has FSA under the rules of construction, rules of construction also value that the entire document be read for consistency. Fiona may claim that rules of construction favor her interpretation of the conveyance as an FSSCS; the intent of her mother, as she sees it, to maintain the property in her family, which cannot be done in Eve sells the property to a real estate developer. If Eve's basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre through the conveyance is successful, she should consider using arguments from the barn case (where the daughter did not want the barn destroyed for sentimental value); and the Arkland case (where the coal developer wanted a partition by sale that prejudiced the interests of the othe beneficiaries). Even if the Blackacre is in a deteriorating condition (similar to the barn case), Eve can still argue that she has sentinemntal value and does not want it destroyed; and she should use the best interest test to demonstrate that the economic sale although it will benefit Eve (and possibly Fiona as a future interest holder), her interest is non-economic, but rather sentimental and because of long-standing ownership. The property not only belonged to her mother but also her grandparents. If they are unable find a resolution, they may use the Unified Parittion of Heirs Property Act to find a reasonable buy out measures. CHANE. adverse possessor must actually enter the property, exlusively, in a notorious and open manner, that is hostile, adverse (claim of right - 3 standards - objective, ) and continuous for the statutory period. "," Peter's Legal Rights and Options. The issue here is Peter will still be responsible for paying the rest of his five year lease. Linda has delivered legal and actual possession to Peter for 12 years. A landlord has a duty to deliver legal and actual possession. Under the American rule, a landlord only has a duty to deliver legal possession. Under the English rule, a landlord has a duty to delivery legal and actual posession. A landlord (LL) also provides his tenants with an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. The landlord promises to not disrupt the tenant's use and enjoyment of the property. A breach of implied convenant of quiet enjoyment (BQE) can occur through actual / partial eviction; constructive eviction; and a request for damages. In order to claim for BCQE, a tenant needs to provide the landlord with a reasonable time to remedy the situation; and leave a reasonable amount of time. Actual / partial eviction relates to the actual dispossession of the tenant. Constructive eviction is substantial interference such that the tenant has been dispossessed from the property. Peter may claim that Linda has breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment constructively evicting him by limiting his access to the backdoor entrance into the building and ongoing construction that is impeding his ability to run his business. Weak argument for constructive Eviction, door, parking lot, parking space Peter's argument concerning constructive eviction because of the substantial interference from the construction in allowing him or his customers to conveniently access the backdoor of the building will not be considered a particularly strong claim to constructive eviction. Similar to the Echo Consulting case, where a bank was under construction, and the company was inconvenienced by a different entrance, Peter (and Echo's lease) only spoke to a common right of access. Linda will claim that she has not breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment because Peter's lease provided him with access to a common right of access thererto; a common use of the parking lot; and one designated parking spot. The front entrance to the pizza place has not been impeded at all. Parking Spot. Linda will claim that the minor encroachment on his parking spot does not reach substantial interference (similar to the McEnany case where a wall was built encroaching on the rented property, a court held that you rent all of the property or pay not rent on the property. In modern times, this would not be possible, and the second restatement of property would not allow Peter to abate his rent for a de minimis encroachment). Backdoor. Although the construction has impeded his use of the backdoor, which he regularly used Parking Spot. Linda will claim that the minor encroachment on his parking spot does not reach substantial interference (similar to the McEnany case where a wall was built encroaching on the rented property, a court held that you rent all of the property or pay not rent on the property. In modern times, this would not be possible, and the second restatement of property would not allow Peter to abate his rent for a de minimis encroachment). Backdoor. Although the construction has impeded his use of the backdoor, which he regularly used for customers and quick pizza deliveries, Peter's lease similarly to the Echo Consulting, provides him with a common right of access. The court in Echo held that the common right of access in the lease did not amount to constructive eviction of Echo from the premises during construction because they still had access to their business, however inconvenient the access may be. Here, similarly, although the backdoor was easier for Peter's business (using it regularly for customers entering through the parking lot and quick pizza deliveries), his lease did not guarantee that access for him, but rather a common right of access, which has not been impeded at all. The parking lot. Although the construction has made it a maze to enter the rear door, it appears from the fact pattern that the parking lot is still accessible. If Peter makes a claim of constructive eviction based on the door, he risks paying the rest of his five- year lease. His lease clearly states that there is a common entrance, and although not convenient it does not rise to the level of substantial interference most likely necessary for constructive eviction. Strengths of constructive eviction claim concerning the construction. However, all is not lost, Peter may have a strong argument to break his five year lease. Peter can claim Linda breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment not because of the door but by constructively evicting Peter because of the ongoing construction that is substantially interfering with his business. In Echo Consulting, the court broadened its definition of constructive eviction to include the substantial interference experienced by the company during the ongoign construction project. Peter may have a strong claim for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment. Peter provided Linda, his landlord with a reasonable amount of time to remedy the situation related to construction. Linda could have at least provided him with a timeline, but days have turned to weeks and weeks to months. Every week Peter has to call Linda for a status update on the repairs, and there seems to be no end in site to the construction repairs. Linda may argue that Peter has not left in a reasonable time, if he has not left by now. However, Peter may have a strong argument as to leaving now to break his five year lease. In the Reste case, the jewelry tenant provided the landlord with a great deal of information, waiting Peter may have a strong claim for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment. Peter provided Linda, his landlord with a reasonable amount of time to remedy the situation related to construction. Linda could have at least provided him with a timeline, but days have turned to weeks and weeks to months. Every week Peter has to call Linda for a status update on the repairs, and there seems to be no end in site to the construction repairs. Linda may argue that Peter has not left in a reasonable time, if he has not left by now. However, Peter may have a strong argument as to leaving now to break his five year lease. In the Reste case, the jewelry tenant provided the landlord with a great deal of information, waiting patiently while repairs were done to alleviate the constant flooding that they were experiencing. Finally, there was a crowing blow, and the jewelry tenant provided the landlord official notice of the issue, provided the landlord with a reasonable time to remedy the situation, and finally the jewelry company vacated the premises. In order to successfully claim constructive eviction, Peter will have to vacate the premises. The court in Reste held that although the tenant had stayed, reasonable time is variable based on court facts. Peter may have to consider whether the crowning blow is the reduction of his profits beyond a point where he can no longer see being profitable or having the nessary finances to leave and set up shop elsewhere. Linda may argeu that the $100 abatement should be enough compensation for the construction nuisance, and that she has shared her sympathy, but Peter should argue in response that she has not resolve the construction issue in a reasonable time, and that he had to vacate the premises when it became too financially inexpedient to continue in that area otherwise. Should a court not accept his claim for constructive eviction, and Linda accepts his surrender of the premises, Linda may allow him to leave without paying the rest of his five year lease, since he just renewed the lease on January 1st, 2019 soon after the construction started in the Spring. Linda may also negotiate a shorter term end date with Peter; however Linda will have to mitigate the costs of damages of rent Peter may owe on rent, by making a good faith effort to re-let the premises, and the burden of proof will be on her to show her attempts to re-let.

43da532e-504a-485a-8559-92b640834f06," Given the current situation, the parties' interests in Blackacre created by Dana's conveyance are as follows: because of the langauge of the conveyance Eve has either a vested remained in fee simple subject condition subequent in fee simple absolute (""provided that"") or a fee simple determinable in fee simple absolute (""so long as""). Eve does not have a fee simple subject to exectory limtation becuase there is no third party involved. Dana has a right of entry or power of termination in FSA or a power of termination in FSA, again, depending on how the court conveys the language. Fiona has nothing because she is not only not mentioned in the conveyance, but accoridng to Dana's will, Fiona inherits all of her personal property often referred to as chattel, NOT her real property, i.e. her land, i.e. Blackacre. Regarding Eve's ownership there are several issues to examine. First, did Dana create a FSA or a life estate. As noted above, the court would most likely hold the converyance was in FSA. The rules of construction dictate that a FSA shosuld be favored. In addition, in Baker v Weedon, the exact same line was in the conveyance ""my house is not to be sold"". There, the court debated whether the conveyance created a life estate or a FSA and held that it created a FSA. Baker dictated that you must look at the intent of the grantor, and thus, here the conveyance indicates that Dana does not wish her house to have a reversion but rather that there be no reversion and thus is a FSA. In addition, the rules of construction and the court in Baker noted that you must look at the conveyance as a whole and in doing that here, it appears Dana intends for the house to be Eve's and no one elses (so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house). Secondly, what Eve has is dependent on the language of the conveyance and according to the rules of the construction, what the grantor (in this case, Dana) intended. In addition, the rules of construction dictate that a FSSCS shoud be favored over a FSD. However, the Marenholz case went aganist this rule when it held that the schoolhouse was conveyed in FSD, rather than FSSCS for several reasons. First, the conveyance noted the school should be used for school purposes only otherwise to revert to the grantor. Because there was no ""may re-enter"" the school grounds if it was not used accordingly, the court held that the right of entry, as would be created by a FSSCS, did not apply - the grantor did not because the grantor had no choice if he wanted have a choice to re-enter if he/she wised to do so.2Thus, to re-enter the premises, this led the court to conclude the conveyance created a FSD. Likewise, in this situation there is no language used to indicate that Dana intends for Blackacre to be sold - she simply when it held that the schoolhouse was conveyed in FSD, rather than FSSCS for several reasons. First, the conveyance noted the school should be used for school purposes only otherwise to revert to the grantor. Because there was no ""may re-enter"" the school grounds if it was not used accordingly, the court held that the right of entry, as would be created by a FSSCS, did not apply - the grantor did not have a choice to re-enter if he/she wised to do so. Thus, because the grantor had no choice if he wanted to re-enter the premises, this led the court to conclude the conveyance created a FSD. Likewise, in this situation there is no language used to indicate that Dana intends for Blackacre to be sold - she simply outright states, ""it is not to be sold"". There is no indication conveying otherwise that there is another option for how Dana wishes the ownership fo Blackacre to be. Therefore, the court would likely find that she intended to create a FSD. With the agrument between whether a conveyance creates a FSD and FSSCS, there comes adverse possession implications. If Eve owns Blackacre in FSD in FSA then adverse possesion kicked in immediately when Dana tragically passed away. Fiona wants the property back and assumes Eve will pay for all the repairs. In order for Eve to keep Blackacre she must show that Fiona does not have a strong claim to it via adverse possession under the rules noted by the common law and as expounded in Mclean v Stevens and Howard v Kunto cases. Fiona must show her use of the land was continuous for the statuoy period. The SOL is 10 years - Eve moved in on 2010 and Dana died in 2014 that is only 4 years. In 2019, Fiona decided she wanted to move back in. Fiona could aruge that she had lived in the house since 1980 (when was Fiona born?) until she left in college until 2003 - which would meet the SOL. But, Eve would argue that is not at all continuous because Fiona went away until 2019 to go to college and then only to return for the the anniversary of her mother's death. But, Fiona could aruge Eve's use is also not contionous because she moved to Florida and has not been using the proeprty since 2010, only to re-enter in 2019 for the anniversary (and even then, the SOL is 10 years - that is only 9). Fiona must show her use of the land was hostile and under a claim of right. Fiona did not get permission from the true owner, Dana, and thus the hositlity element is met. This jurisdiction's state of mind is an objective standard which means that the adverses possesors, Fiona's state of mind, is irrelevant. Fiona must show her use of the land was actual. Fiona was not on the property untl the five year anniversary of her mothers death, and only then did she decide she wanted to move back in. Thus, she did not use the property like a true owner would and as held in Mclean if it was not sufficiently obvoius to permit a reasonably diligent owner (here, Eve) to notice and object then there was no actual use. mind is an objective standard which means that the adverses possesors, Fiona's state of mind, is irrelevant. Fiona must show her use of the land was actual. Fiona was not on the property untl the five year anniversary of her mothers death, and only then did she decide she wanted to move back in. Thus, she did not use the property like a true owner would and as held in Mclean if it was not sufficiently obvoius to permit a reasonably diligent owner (here, Eve) to notice and object then there was no actual use. However, Fiona could counterargue by saying that Eve was also not treating the property the way a true owner would because that house was not faring well - the roof shingles were missing, the glass was cracked, and there were other serous problems. That is undebatbly not the way a true owner would maintain their property. In additoin, Eve does not even live on the property! She is distraught by the death of her cousin Dana and because the memories are too strong she locked the house and moved to Florida. If she is not even living there, then there is no actual use. No one in this fact pattern is actually using Blackacre. Fiona must show her use of hte land notorious and open. Fiona again, did not use the land so she has no argument here. In order to prove this, she had to sufficiently put the true owner on constructive notice (should have known) that someone else was using her property, but she never even enterered the property until that anniversary so this argument would not suffice. Fiona must show her use of the land was exclusive. Fiona can make one strong argument here if she truly intends it to be true. Right now, she is not using Blackacre exclusively, or really at all. Eve perhaps coulr argue she is because the exclsuive element is met by arguing that the true owner and the adverse possesor cannot both use the property the way the title holder would. The strong argument Fiona can make is that Eve is intending to sell the property! Thus, she is not using it (or planning to use it) exclusively and is concerned primarly with how much commerical value the property has - which a court might hold is incredibly selfish and rather, other facts, such as sentimental value should be considered. Furthermore, Fiona can again point out Eve is not using the property at all except she is the only one paying taxes on the property. Fiona has realtively weak claims to owning Blackacre via adverse possessoin and therefore does not have a basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackare and/or for holding Eve accountable for the repairs neded on blackacre. In addition, she also has no claim to Blackacre because she was not given anything in the conveyance (probably because she said she had no interest in returning to blackacre when Dana was drafting the conveyance). The only possible remedy perhaps would be that a court feels symapthetic towards Fiona because Blackacre was her mother's who tragically passed away - she Fiona has realtively weak claims to owning Blackacre via adverse possessoin and therefore does not have a basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackare and/or for holding Eve accountable for the repairs neded on blackacre. In addition, she also has no claim to Blackacre because she was not given anything in the conveyance (probably because she said she had no interest in returning to blackacre when Dana was drafting the conveyance). The only possible remedy perhaps would be that a court feels symapthetic towards Fiona because Blackacre was her mother's who tragically passed away - she wanted to keep Blackacre in the family, and Fiona is her issue, i.e. directly in her family. The court should look at more than just the econmic value of the property, but rather also the sentimental value to Fiona and the best interests of all the parites involved (Fiona, Eve, and what Dana intended). Therefore, while Fiona may have a weak argument/claim on the basis of adverse possession, she can passionately argue what Blackacre means to her and how she has more of an attachment to it than Eve, who just wants to sell it and is only considering what other bids she can get for the propery since it is clearly apprecaited in value. Dana intended for the house NOT to be sold - Fiona could aruge Eve is going aganist the grantor's wishses and if the court reads the conveyance for there to be a power of termination, perhaps Eve should not live on or own the property. "," As a preliminary matter, Peter is in a term of years lease which means he is obligated/liable for the rent until his lease ends on December 31, 2023 and this lease does not require notice if the tenant wishes to abandon or surrender the property. (in periodic term? because lease renews each year... not automatically, Peter himself does have to renew it... but then notice is required...). In addition, before Peter does anything else, he must first give his landlord, Linda, notice and reasonable time to fix the isuses - which he does, as he corresponds with Linda on a weekly basis indicating what the issues are. Linda attempts to fix the issues by deducting costs from his rent and is sympathic, explaining to Peter why the repairs are taking so long. Peter should be not concerned about self-help because Linda is not legally entitled to engage in self-help and remove Peter and his belongings from the shop. As the court held in Berg v Wiley, any self help re- entry aganist a tenant in possession is wrongful under the growing modern doctrine that a landlord must resort to the judicial process to enforce his/her statutory remedy aganist a tenant wrongfully in possession. Peter should be aware, if this does result in a judicial process, that could be a downside to Peter because now his name is in the court system as a tenat who got evicted. In this case however, it does not appear Linda is looking to kick Peter out of the premises, but rather that Peter himself wants to abandon or surrender the shop and his main concern is breaking his lease. and remove Peter and his belongings from the shop.

In this case however, it does not appear Linda is looking to kick Peter out of the premises, but rather that Peter himself wants to abandon or surrender the shop and his main concern is breaking his lease. With regards to breaking his lease, Peter has several claims he can make. In every residential and commercial lease is an a covenant which dictates that neither a landlord nor a person of paramount title may interfere with the tenants quiet enjoyment or possession of the premises. Peter can thus allege that Linda broke this covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) which can result in actual eviction if total/partial dispossesion, constructive evicition if the interference was so substantial it was as if the tenat was deprived of the property, or at the very least damages. Here, Peter can say the breach of the CQE lead to constructive eviction which would entitle him to stop paying rent and vacate the premises within a reasonable time. Under a theory of constructive eviction, Peter must show that the landlords conduct interfered with the presmises, that inteferece was so substantial, that the tenant notified the landlord or the landlord knew, and that the tenant vacated the presmises within a reasonable time. In this case, it was not techincaily the landlord's conduct that interefered with peter's posession, it was the construction companys, but Peter could argue that Linda was the one who hired them to do repairs. Peter could argue it was substantial because when examining the terms of his lease which give him access to the parking lot and parking space - both are now difficult to access. Peter did both notify Linda and Linda was aware of the issues and although Linda has tried to reapir the damage a bit by deducting Peter's costs in rent, Peter can still leave within a reasonable time if he chooses to do so under a theory of constructive eviction. The facts here are somewhat analogous to those in Rest Realty where the condition of the property became intolerable and deprived the teant of the use of the premises. However, Linda has quite a few counter arguments she can make here - one, that this is nowhere as bad as the flooding in Rest Realty because Peter can still use his shop (which he does) and can stil use the back door (albeit it being difficult), and can still use his parking spot (albeit it being a tight fit) - nevertheless, he can still use everything! The interference is also not permanent, but as courts have held in prior cases, the intereference does not need to be ""permanent"" but rather just needs to be substantial. Peter could aruge that the noise and he scaffolding is a substantial interference as it is bothering him and deterring customers and making it diffciult to do pizza deliveries, so he is losing money, but Linda could aruge depsite the noise interference from the construction is only temporary and will not be a permanent thing. because Peter can still use his shop (which he does) and can stil use the back door (albeit it being difficult), and can still use his parking spot (albeit it being a tight fit) - nevertheless, he can still use everything!

Peter could aruge that the noise and he scaffolding is a substantial interference as it is bothering him and deterring customers and making it diffciult to do pizza deliveries, so he is losing money, but Linda could aruge depsite the noise interference from the construction is only temporary and will not be a permanent thing. As the court held in Echo, there was neither a partical actual eviction or a constructive eviction because the interference was not permananet - it was only temporaray, as in the situation here - and the remedy was damages. Thus, perhaps Peter could sue for damages citing this case. In addition, Linda could argue that Peter is not leaving within a reasonable time - he waited several months and there really has been no ""crowning blow"" - but Peter could say that the crowning blow was that she told him the constrcution would last a week, but it has lasted months, and that he is losing business and thus losing money. However, Peter must keep in mind he can only claim constrctive evcition if his landlord, Linda, had a duty to fix the repairs. Peter could also argue along the same lines, as in the Smith case, that if the court finds partial eviction from the property this counts as an actual eviction from the entire property and thus suspends rent from the whole property i.e. Peter can stop paying rent completely because rent is being paid for that entire shop, not just parts of it. Again, Linda's argument is that she deducted costs from the rent to mititage this and Peter is still using the property. If Peter is unable to raise a successful defense under a theory of constructive eviction, he could still aruge that Linda has a reasonble duty to mitigate damages under the growing modern contract approach to leases as set forth in Sommer v Kridel. If Peter vacates and Linda sues him for not paying rent, Linda must show that she took steps to re-let the apartment either by showing it, advertisting it (in this day and age perhaps on zillow or craigslist) or used a realtor. The policy rational is that because the tenant is in an inferior position and the landlord has better knowledege about repairs that he is thus in a better position to mitigate any damages. Here, Linda could argue there is really only so much that she can do - if the construction company still needs to make repairs, then she cannot stop them if she wants those repairs done on the commerical building. In addition, the contractor originally told Linda that repairs would only take about a week or so, so how was she to know that they would take longer - that is, Linda could argue, quite honestly a problem on the part of the construction compnay for not being diligent in their work or not accounting for things and how long the repairs would really take. Peter should also be aware that while Linda has a duty to fix any defects, Peter also has the duty not to position to mitigate any damages.

Peter should also be aware that while Linda has a duty to fix any defects, Peter also has the duty not to commit affirmative (voluntary acts that decrease the value of the property) or permissive waste (negligence). If Linda can find an argument peter committed any waste that would also be an argument in her favor, but it appears both Peter and Linda are very respectful and Linda is sympathetic to Peter's plight. In fact, again, she tried to mitigate damages when she deducted $100 from peter's monthly rent for the hassle which goes to show she is being a reasonable and diligent landlord and that she is in part trying to make up for the fact that he is losing money from his pizza shop business. If Peter does decide to stay in the commerical building, he can argue that Linda breached the implied warranty of hability, implied in every residentail lease and unwaivable. Under this breach, Peter could withhold some/all of the rent, sue for damages, or fix the repairs himself and deduct those costs from the rent. However, Linda already deducted costs from his rent and how he would go about moving heavy construction equipment off his parking spot is a harder problem to solve. In addition, how he would attempt to fix the scaffolding in the rear of the building is also a difficult problem to solve and thus the latter option mentioned is a bit inappplicable. This furthermore might be a weak argument for Peter, Linda could aruge, because this is a commerical building, not a residential one. Peter has a stronger argument claiming a breach of CQE under a theory of constructive eviction. However, Peter can potentailly get around that fact by also showing under this breach that there was a violation of the housing code or more significantly, a substanial impact on health or saftety - proven by how difficult it is to go thorugh the maze of scaffolding in the back entrance (what if someone was to get injured doing so when they are carrying out a ton of boxes for a pizza delivery for example) and there is dust from the construction that flies into this pizza shop (probably ruining the pizza). Peter could cite to/reference Hilder v St Peter wher the property essentialy became uninhabitbale, but Linda would counter argue this by again noting that Peter is still using everything (his parking spot, the rear entrance, his shop) even if it is increasingly difficult and frustarting and he is losing money. Linda could argue that te property is not uninhaibitable so to compare to Hilder v St Peter is quite a stark comparison. While this is understandably an annoying and frustarting situation for Peter, Linda is doing her part to stay in touch and communicate when repairs will be done. Examining this situation from a sentimental Hilder v St Peter wher the property essentialy became uninhabitbale, but Linda would counter argue this by again noting that Peter is still using everything (his parking spot, the rear entrance, his shop) even if it is increasingly difficult and frustarting and he is losing money. Linda could argue that te property is not uninhaibitable so to compare to Hilder v St Peter is quite a stark comparison. While this is understandably an annoying and frustarting situation for Peter, Linda is doing her part to stay in touch and communicate when repairs will be done. Examining this situation from a sentimental perspective, Peter should consider his realtionship with Linda his landlord and how they have a had a relationship since 2007 and created a new lease that goes until 2023 - that is quite a bit of time together so far as a landlord-tenant relationship goes and although the fact pattern does not say, perhaps Peter never encounted any problems with Linda before this and thus besides this occurence, has appreciated having Linda as is landlord. In addition, the fact pattern does state that Peter enjoyed having his pizza shop on Main Street. Linda can speak to the construction company to try and speed things up, but if Peter truly wishes to, he can leave without being responsible for his five-year lease if he is able to raise a succesful defense under any of the aformentioned claims, albeit the several weaknesses that Linda can point out.

9db4494e-5ddd-4a7d-b3e9-031a33003a02," 1. There are many issues of interests for Blackacre within this situation. Interests of the Conveyance In 2010, Dana conveyed Blackacre to her cousin Eve. The issue is whether this conveyance granted Blackacre to Eve in fee simple determinable (FSD) or fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS). The conveyance contains both conditional and durational language, by saying, ""provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house"". Therefore, the conveyance is ambigious, and a court would have to make a determination as to what interest it created. A conveyance grants a propery in FSSCS if the language that the conveyance uses is conditional. In a FSSCS, the grantor maintains the right of entry or power of termination in the property. In this case, the conveyance contains the conditional language ""provided that"". There could be an argument that this created a FSSCS. First, according to the common law Rules of Construction, in analyzing an ambigious conveyance, courts should favor a FSSCS over a FSD. This is because in a FSSCS, the grantor maintains a right of entry or power of termination upon the condition being breached, thus giving the grantor merely the option to retake the property if he or she wants to follwing a breach of the condition. The policy rationale for this is to give the grantor an option of retaking the property instead of the obligation to do so as soon as the condition set forth in the conveyance is broken. It also prevents a situation of adverse possession, because if this conveyance were found to be an FSSCS and Eve broke it, she would not begin an adverse possession claim because Dana's estate would maintain merely an option to retake the property, thus nullifying the hostile element of adverse possession. The policy rationale in favor of this is one of certainty. It is better to favor the original grantor who can maintain certainty that he or she maintains an interest in their property that they once held in FSA. A conveyance grants a property in FSD if the language that the conveyance uses is durational. In an FSD, the grantor maintains a possibility of reverter in the property. In this case, the conveyance contains the durational language ""only so long as"". There could be an argument that this created a FSD. Like in the Mahrenholz case, in which an ambigious conveyance was read to favor a FSD over a rationale in favor of this is one of certainty. It is better to favor the original grantor who can maintain certainty that he or she maintains an interest in their property that they once held in FSA. A conveyance grants a property in FSD if the language that the conveyance uses is durational. In an FSD, the grantor maintains a possibility of reverter in the property. In this case, the conveyance contains the durational language ""only so long as"". There could be an argument that this created a FSD. Like in the Mahrenholz case, in which an ambigious conveyance was read to favor a FSD over a FSSCS, here, it is clear that Eve was intending to retake the property if Eve attempted to sell the house. The possibility of reverter that a grantor maintains automatically retakes the property as soon as the condition is broken. Again, like in Mahrenholz, two different Rules of Construction were followed: looking at the intent of the grantor, and reading the document as a whole. In Mahrenholz, the key distinction was a sentence after the conveyance itself that stated, ""otherwise to revert to grantor"". Dana clearly intended that she sought to retake the property if Eve attempted to sell the house. By reading the rest of the document, which states clearly, ""[t]he house is not to be sold"", Dana sought to keep the house within her family, and wanted to immediately retake the property if Eve tried to sell it. Eve Permitted to Solicit Other Offers? Eve can seek to make arguments that she is permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre. The value of the property had gone much higher than Eve realized when she left the house in New Suffolk in 2014. It was worth much more money to sell than to live in to her. This is similar to Baker v. Weedon, where the person holding the present interest in the property sought to sell the property while the future interests sought to keep the property. In that case, the court decided that to determine the judicial sale of a property, the interests of all interest holders - present and future - had to be taken into account to prevent economic waste. Similarly, in this case, Eve seeks to sell the house, while Dana (via her estate, which is held by Fiona) clearly intended for her not to do so. However, in looking at all of the interests of the parties, the court would have to weigh Eve's economic interests in selling the property against the sentimental value of the house that Dana put in it in the first place when making the conveyance that the house was not to be sold. It is possible that Fiona does not hold that same snetimental value of the house as her mother did, as she had expressed that she had no interest in living in New Suffolk and had left, so Fiona may permit the sale of the property (although Fiona did feel sentimental about the house upon seeing it in 2019). However, the court likely would be unable to the opinion of Fiona. authorize the judicial sale of the property without 3hearing Eve has a somewhat weaker argument behind her in another two of the Rules of Construction used in conveyance that the house was not to be sold. It is possible that Fiona does not hold that same snetimental value of the house as her mother did, as she had expressed that she had no interest in living in New Suffolk and had left, so Fiona may permit the sale of the property (although Fiona did feel sentimental about the house upon seeing it in 2019). However, the court likely would be unable to authorize the judicial sale of the property without hearing the opinion of Fiona. Eve has a somewhat weaker argument behind her in another two of the Rules of Construction used in interpreting ambigious conveyances: courts tend to favor free alienability of property where possible and courts favor awarding property in fee simple absolute where possible. Fee simple absolute gives absolute property rights to the property. Like in White v. Brown, where a house was left in an ambigious conveyance that left it ""to be lived in"" and the court found that this created a fee simple absolute instead of a life estate, the conveyance here states that ""the house is not to be sold"". However, this could be read like the clause of the house ""to be lived in"" as a mere preference of the grantor who is giving the house in fee simple absolute as a gift, instead of as a condition or limitation on the conveyance. In this case, however, Fiona would point out that another rule of construction would likely defeat such a possibility. This rule is that courts read the document as a whole. It is quite clear in the first sentence of the conveyance that the conveyance is only valid ""provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house"". Thus, the second sentence further explaining that ""the house is not to be sold"" would likely not be read like the ambigious will in White v. Brown but would be read as a binding condition of the conveyance. Eve could further argue within the free alienability of property rule that she is allowed to at least solicit offers to the house without actually attempting to sell the house. The first offer came to her without any solicitation, but through that offer, Eve discovered that Blackacre is worth much more money than she originally thought. It is possible that a court would find that mere soliciation of an offer does not constitute attempting to sell the house. This would be within the free alienability of property rule, which seeks to give the most freedom of use of property to the grantee in an ambigious conveyance. Eve could argue that soliciting offers is totally unrelated to seeking to sell the house. Finding that her property is worth more than she thought could be used to rent out the property at a reasonable price or discover why she is paying so much in real estate taxes, which she set to autopay annually. Both of these actions would be fully within the conveyance, as neither seeks to sell the house. Thus, Eve has a strong argument here for why she should be allowed to solicit offers for the house. Fiona's Rights to Reclaim Ownership of Blackacre property is worth more than she thought could be used to rent out the property at a reasonable price or discover why she is paying so much in real estate taxes, which she set to autopay annually. Both of these actions would be fully within the conveyance, as neither seeks to sell the house. Thus, Eve has a strong argument here for why she should be allowed to solicit offers for the house. Fiona's Rights to Reclaim Ownership of Blackacre Fiona may have a difficult time trying to reclaim ownership of Blackacre, as Eve likely has not violated the terms of not selling Blackacre merely by moving to Florida. However, Fiona can employ a Rule of Construction to help her case. Fiona can argue that the court could find that Eve violated the condition of the conveyance by looking at the intent of the grantor, one of the Rules of Construction. Fiona can argue that Dana clearly intended for Eve to live in the house, not merely ""not attempt to sell the house"". Fiona can point to the sentimental value that the house held for Dana and Eve, who grew up in the house together. Dana's clear intent was that she wanted to allow Eve to have the house as long as she lived in it, not just to have it in her name and then move to Florida and allow so many problems to appear on the property. On the other hand, Eve would again point to White v. Brown, in which the ambigious conveyance of the house ""to be lived in"" was read to give more alienability to the grantee. Furthermore and as previously mentioned, Eve could also point out to the Rule of Construction of reading the document as a whole, arguing that the second sentence that states ""[t]he house is not to be sold"" is not a superflous sentence but a restatement of the clear intent of Dana, the grantor, that Dana did not want the house to be sold, and if she wanted Eve to live in it, Dana would have added a sentence that stated thus. Fiona's Right to Hold Eve Accountable for Repairs The issue is whether Fiona can hold Eve accountable for repairs to Blackacre in its damaged state. Under the doctrine of waste, present interest holders must not commit waste in a way that would alter the property for future interest holders. Future interests holders have a right to expect the property in the condition that it was in when it was granted. In this case, Eve has likely committed passive waste. Passive waste is when omission of taking care of the property by a present interest holder alters the state of the property for a current interest holder. Fiona can argue that Eve did so because she left the property for 5 years, never visted it, paid the taxes on auto-pay, and never checked on the property until Eve and Fiona decided to meet at Blackacre in New Suffolk in 2019 - a full 5 years after Eve moved to Florida. Because Eve's misuse of the property significantly altered the condition of the property for a the property for future interest holders. Future interests holders have a right to expect the property in the condition that it was in when it was granted. In this case, Eve has likely committed passive waste. Passive waste is when omission of taking care of the property by a present interest holder alters the state of the property for a current interest holder. Fiona can argue that Eve did so because she left the property for 5 years, never visted it, paid the taxes on auto-pay, and never checked on the property until Eve and Fiona decided to meet at Blackacre in New Suffolk in 2019 - a full 5 years after Eve moved to Florida. Because Eve's misuse of the property significantly altered the condition of the property for a future interest holder, a court could hold Eve accountable for paying for the repairs to Blackacre. Eve can argue that Fiona's concern for the property is feigned. Eve can point to the fact that Fiona left Blackacre in 2003 and now works as a fashion designer in New York City. Thus, Eve could suggest that, while Fiona does have a future interest in the property, Fiona has not exercised any concern for the property before, and has only done so at this moment upon seeing the house in poor condition. Eve would argue that the house could have been in this condition while Eve was still living there and Fiona wouldn't have known it. In this way, Eve could argue that, although she is guilty of permissive waste, forcing her to pay for repairs for Fiona's benefit would be unjust. "," In this hypothetical, Peter and Linda are in a landlord tenant situation. They have a term of years lease that begins on January 1, 2019 and automatically terminates on December 31, 2023. Until then, Peter has a duty to pay rent. At common law, Linda has a duty not to breach a set of regulations that is implied in every lease known as the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment. Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment The issue is whether Peter can claim that the excessive construction constitutes a breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (CQE). There are three possibilities for an assertion breach of the CQE: partial actual eviction, constructive eviction, and damages. Peter may be able to assert a claim for partial actual eviction. A partial actual eviction occurs when the tenant is physically blocked from accessing part of the land described in the lease. Like in Smith v. McEnaney, in which a brick wall built by the landlord slightly encroached on the tenant's leased land, the construction equipment goes over the white line into Peter's parking spot, which is overtly granted in his lease as his ""designated parking spot"". In Smith (a case that took place in 1897), the court ruled that the entire lease would therefore be invalidated, arguing that the land is leased as a whole. However, Peter may be able to assert a claim for partial actual eviction. A partial actual eviction occurs when the tenant is physically blocked from accessing part of the land described in the lease. Like in Smith v. McEnaney, in which a brick wall built by the landlord slightly encroached on the tenant's leased land, the construction equipment goes over the white line into Peter's parking spot, which is overtly granted in his lease as his ""designated parking spot"". In Smith (a case that took place in 1897), the court ruled that the entire lease would therefore be invalidated, arguing that the land is leased as a whole. However, modern common law, such as the Restatement (Second) of Property, clarifies that there should merely be a corresponding reduction in rent. For example, if 10% of the property was blocked, the lease would still be enforced, but the rent would be reduced by 10%. In this case, Linda could argue the encroachment into his parking spot is very minor - so minor, in fact, that Peter can actually still fit into his parking spot, just in a tight squeeze. Therefore, although Peter could successfully assert a claim for partial actual eviction because the construction equipment does technically sit over the line into his parking spot, it is very unlikely that the minor encroachment of the construction equipment would be enough to invalidate the entire lease. Peter could also assert a claim for a constructive eviction. A constructive eviction is a non-physical eviction where the landlord's conduct causes a situation in which it is ""as-if"" a tenant has been evicted because the breach of CQE is so substantial. Similarly to the Reste Realty case, in which constant flooding occurred every time it rained and created a semi-permanent situation of not being able to use the property, it could be analogized that the impermanent nature of construction has remained permanent in such a way that Peter can't use the property. The maze of scaffolding in the back remains even when construction work isn't being done, thus making it very difficult for Peter's staff to use the backdoor and make on time pizza deliveries. Furthermore, the dust is constantly there, so Peter can never open the windows to his restaurant. While the construction is not permanent, it has been ongoing for a long time despite repeated promises to fix it from the landlord. This is very similar to Reste Realty, where the flooding wasn't actually a permanent condition, but it was as if it was permanent because the situatoin itself that caused the flooding, which was a faulty system of drainage in the driveway, was never rectified. On the other hand, Linda would argue that the construction itself does not constitute a partial actual eviction because the construction is impermanent - it is just unclear how long it will be present. To successfully assert a constructive eviction, there are four elements: that the landlord caused the issue; that the issue is so substantial to breach the7CQE; that the tenant notified the landlord of the issue and gave a reasonable time to fix it; and that the tenant actually vacated the premises. Peter would argue that Linda is at fault for the issue, as she ordered the construction. However, Linda would argue that she never rectified. On the other hand, Linda would argue that the construction itself does not constitute a partial actual eviction because the construction is impermanent - it is just unclear how long it will be present. To successfully assert a constructive eviction, there are four elements: that the landlord caused the issue; that the issue is so substantial to breach the CQE; that the tenant notified the landlord of the issue and gave a reasonable time to fix it; and that the tenant actually vacated the premises. Peter would argue that Linda is at fault for the issue, as she ordered the construction. However, Linda would argue that she needed to make these repairs to her building and that it is not her fault that there have been complications to the construction. Peter can clearly argue that the issue is substantial enough to breach the CQE by showing that his profits are down and that he is never able to even open his windows. Peter also can show that he notified the landlord and gave a reasonable time to rectify the situation because Linda had at first said that the construction would take a week, but it has now become a matter of months, which is unreasonable. Finally, Peter would have to vacate the premises. The policy rationale for this element is that to demonstrate that it is ""as if"" you have been evicted and therefore freed of your lease, you have to do the most important part of being evicted: actually leaving. This would be difficult for Peter, as he would have to relocate his entire business. Furthermore, depending on the lease or the new place he locates his restaurant at, it could be significantly expensive for him to bring his equipment, merchandise, and inventory with him. Therefore, it would be risky for Peter to try to assert a constructive eviction, especially because of Linda's argument that the construction going long is not her fault. Finally, if there is an assertion of a breach of CQE, a court can order damages to be paid. The situation at hand is akin to the Echo Consulting case, where a bank was renting the bottom floor of a building where the landlord had begun construction, blocking one of the entrances and causing very loud noise to disrupt the day. Similarly, the back entrance of Peter's pizza shop has essentially been blocked by a maze of scaffolding. Additionally, there is much noise and the dust has made it so Peter can't open the windows to his pizza shop. In Echo, the court pointed out that this could not be an actual partial eviction or constructive eviction because the back door was not specifically mentioned in the lease, which is the same for Peter's lease. However, the Echo court did award damages to Echo from the landlord. The court's policy rationale was that although this did not constitute an eviction, it still breached the CQE, and thus there should be some restitution for the tenant. Here, Peter can show the lost profits that resulted from the construction going long because it made it more difficult for his staff to make pizza deliveries on time, thus affecting his business. Linda would argue that she has been very sympathetic to Peter's situation and that she has already paid damages by lowering the rent by $100 a month during the construction. Linda, furthermore, would further argue that this situation is distinct which is the same for Peter's lease. However, the Echo court did award damages to Echo from the landlord. The court's policy rationale was that although this did not constitute an eviction, it still breached the CQE, and thus there should be some restitution for the tenant.

Linda would argue that she has been very sympathetic to Peter's situation and that she has already paid damages by lowering the rent by $100 a month during the construction. Linda, furthermore, would further argue that this situation is distinct from Echo because the back door hasn't even been blocked - it is possible to get through the maze of scaffolding and still use the backdoor. Peter could show that his revenues are down more than $100 per month, at least partially because it is very difficult to navigate the maze of scaffolding and therefore it is very hard to use the backdoor to make pizza deliveries on time, and that Linda should have to pay to compensate him for this. Vacating the Property As discussed above, if Peter can successfuly argue for a partial actual eviction or constructive eviction, then he will be able to break the lease without being held accountable for the remaining rent. However, if he cannot do so, he can still vacate the property and move to a new one despite being in a 5-year lease. Linda cannot necessarily hold Peter liable for the entirety of the 5-year lease if he leaves. This is like Somer v. Kridel. In that case, when a man thought he was going to be able to move into an apartment but was not able to, the landlord did not relet the premises and merely charged the man for the full year's worth of rent. However, the court argued that this was not just and that the landlord has to take reasonable steps to relet the premises because the landlord has a duty to mitigate damages. The policy rationale for this was that the landlord is usually in a position of power and has more resources compared to his or her tenant. The landlord can use these resources to find a new tenant much more easily than the tenant can. In this case, if Peter does vacate the property, Linda would have to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages by looking for a new tenant. Peter could argue that this should be easy. He has owned this pizza shop on Main Street for 12 years, thus suggesting that it has been at least somewhat successful. The lease also comes with parking for staff and customers and sounds like a very attractive business site. If Peter does vacate the property, the burden of proof would be on Linda to show that she is actively searching for new tenants. She can prove this by showing newspaper ads, posts on Craigslist, or other ways of advertising the property. 10 If Linda did this and was unable to find a tenant due to the construction, especially if that construction were ongoing for a long time (such as a matter of years, because Peter's lease is for 5 years), Peter could argue that her reasonable efforts to easy.

381e6532-4d26-4cb3-bd80-79b5628f6ba8," Essay 1: When Dana created the conveyance, the Interests were as follows: Dana has a reversion in fee simple absolute. Eve has a fee simple subject to executory limitation due to the FSSCS conditional language (""provided that"") and FSD durational language (""only so long as"") set forth. Should Eve attempt to sell the house, the property would go to /revert back to Dana. As outlined by the terms of the conveyance, at the time the conveyance was drafted. Fiona does not have any future interest in Blackacre. Because Eve was granted the property under the condition that the house is not to be sold, she may have a hard time pleading that she should be permitted to solicit offers for sale. However, the real estate developer stated that therre was an interest in making an offer for Blackacre- not the house specifically. As in White v. Brown, there is other land on the Blackacre property that is not the house. There was no language set out in the conveyance that said the other land on the property could not be sold. There is also question as to whether Fiona has a basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre. It is possible that there is a basis that can be argued for by Fiona. Though Fiona relinquished her future interest in the property in 2010 when she stated that she ""had no interest in returning to New Suffolk"" (which is likely the reason that the property was conveyed to Eve, as Dana said she wanted to keep the property in the family- this is the intent rather than the language being looked at (looked toward rules of construction)), the language of the conveyance states that should Eve attempt to sell the house, she would not be conveyed Blackacre and the interest would revert back to Dana. Because Dana died testate (according to the fact pattern) and according to Dana's will, Fiona inherits all her personal property- that interest of Dana should be transferred and distributed to Fiona in fee simple absoulute, therefore providing her with a potential basis for reclaiming ownership. In Woodrick v. Wood, sentimental value was taken into consideration- not just economic here, Fiona had sentiment in the property As for the holding Eve accountable for the repairs, Fiona may argue that Eve was commiting waste with the property. Waste is any alteration of the property. There are four types of waste: affirmative property- that interest of Dana should be transferred and distributed to Fiona in fee simple absoulute, therefore providing her with a potential basis for reclaiming ownership. In Woodrick v. Wood, sentimental value was taken into consideration- not just economic here, Fiona had sentiment in the property As for the holding Eve accountable for the repairs, Fiona may argue that Eve was commiting waste with the property. Waste is any alteration of the property. There are four types of waste: affirmative (voluntary and injurious damage), permissive (negligence), ameliorative (voluntary improvements making the property more valuable) and economic waste (where the property is not being put to its most productive use. Fiona could possibly argue that the waste committed by Eve was either permissive or economic. The argument for permissive waste could be that Eve was negligent in leaving the house with roof shingles missing, cracked glass and other serious problems (though she paid the real estate taxes, she did not provide care to it for a total of five year which is an act of neligence). Though the property value was increased, it was not due to Eve, rather it was just the location - therefore, she cannot claim that she committed ameliorative waste. Like Baker v. Weedon, where the property was not being used to its full potential, here Fiona could say that Blackacre it not being put to its its most productive use by simply just being there and no one using it to live, reside, etc. Fiona should be entitled to recover for that waste committed, though Eve did not intentionally commit this waste. "," Essay 2: It is first important to note that Peter is in a term of years lease (five years to be exact). Given the facts of this situation, Peter can allege that his landlord breached his covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE), which is implied in all leases. A breach of a covenant of quiet enjoyment is interference that intrudes on the tenants quiet and beneficial enjoyment/usage of the property, and is applied to both residential and commercial properties. There are three ways that he can allege a breach of CQE: that he has been partially evicted, has been constructively evicted, or at the very least, allege that he is entitled to damages. Peter can claim a partial eviction, though it would not be his strongest argument. As evidenced in Smith v. McEnany, where a brick wall was constructed on the property of the plaintiff, a partial eviction from one area of the property can amount to a eviction from the whole. Here, there is scaffolding present due to the repairs that the landlord Linda is making to the exterior the building in which the pizza place is located. The scaffolding is encroaching a little on the designated parking spot which he was given a right to use in the terms of his lease. Unlike the brick wall case, where the encroaching wall was permanent, damages. Peter can claim a partial eviction, though it would not be his strongest argument. As evidenced in Smith v. McEnany, where a brick wall was constructed on the property of the plaintiff, a partial eviction from one area of the property can amount to a eviction from the whole. Here, there is scaffolding present due to the repairs that the landlord Linda is making to the exterior of the building in which the pizza place is located. The scaffolding is encroaching a little on the designated parking spot which he was given a right to use in the terms of his lease. Unlike the brick wall case, where the encroaching wall was permanent, here, the scaffolding was temporarary and would be removed upon completion of the construction/repairs. Peter could also claim constructive eviction. To allege a constructive eviction, there must be interference to the beneficial use of the property by the landlord's conduct, the interference must be so substantial, the tenant must provide notice to the landlord of the issue and the landlord must be given reasonable time to respond/make the repairs. Peter could argue that by Linda making these repairs, she is interfering with his business and is causing his sales to decrease. Linda can, in turn, aruge that her conduct is being done to benefit the property and she is taking these steps to repair the exterior to either keep the premises safe or to improve the aesthetic to bring more business in. She could also aruge that she was physically not the one who was making the repairs, rather it was a third party whom she had no control over their timeliness. To refute those arguements, Peter could say that she was the one to hire the company, therefore, she was responsible. Though Linda could argue that the repairs/interference was temporary. Next, the tenant must provide the landlord with notice of the substantial intereference. Here, this element cannot be rebutted, as the facts state that Peter called Linda to express his concerns- therefore providing him with adequate notice. Lastly, the landlord must be given a reasonble time to respond/make the requested repairs (case specific). Peter could argue that months are going by and that he is making phone calls to Linda to no avail. Linda could aruge that she is making a reasonable effort to ensure that the construction is completed as soon as possible and that she is being responsive by telling Peter why the repairs are taking so long. She can further allege that the third-party construction workers are the ones who are not completing the job in a timely manner and that she can only do so much about it. In a case such as this one, it is reasonble to infer that construction may take longer than anticipated due to a number of factors (weather, tool issues, etc.- though those are not brought up in this fact pattern). Linda can argue that she was attempting to ""make things right"" for lack of better phrase, by deducting $100 from his monthly rent for the hassle. Unlike Reste Realty where the interference was so substantial as to cause a crowning blow and permanent interference with beneifical use of the property, here the temporary issue may not be enough to successfully claim a constructive eviction. The repairs here are not occuring over and over again as they were in Reste Realty. Lastly, unlike Reste Realty, it.

The repairs here are not occuring over and over again as they were in Reste Realty. Lastly, unlike Reste Realty, Linda is making an effort to keep Peter updated and is keeping her word by providing him with those updates (encouraging that he be patient). She is not telling him that it will be done at a specified time, as was done in Reste Realty, where the landlord failed to making the repairs he promised time and time again. Peter could also allege a claim for damages- which would be his strongest argument out of the three. This fact pattern most closely resembles that of the Echo Consulting (bank) case. In Echo Consulting, the bank workers were not allowed to enter through one of the entrances of their building. Here, the pizza shop is blocked access to the door in which they regularly use. The lease Peter entered into states that the tenant was provided a common right of access, use of the parking lot and one designated parking spot. The lease does not specify the ways of access (does not clearly say through the front of rear entrance). Peter can argue, as done in Echo, that by not being allowed access to the rear door, Linda is breaching the terms of his lease. Like Echo Consulting, where there was another entry point that did not block use of the building in its entierty, here, Linda can argue that there is another mode of entry to the pizza shop in the front that is designated just for them. Though the pizza place customers and workers often used this blocked door for ease, it was not fully inaccessible and the hinderance is not substantial enough, as an average person (customers, workers, etc.) still had the ability to ""navigate the maze"" and enter through the back entrance. Though it was uncomfortable for the delivery workers to get through, discomfort is not enough. Peter can argue that ""navigating through the maze"" can pose a dangerous risk to anyone who tries to do so. Aside from the scaffolding, Peter can argue that the construction noise is interfering literally with the quiet enjoymet of the customers and workers of his pizza parlor. This fact is almost identifical to that of Echo Consulting, where there was construction taking place at the bank that was loud and noisy. Linda can argue that as in Echo, just like the discomfort- a temporary annoyance was not enough. Peter can say that not only was the construction noisy, but the dust that was a result of the construction could pose a detrimental risk of harm to those in the vacinity. Though he closed his windows to prevent the dust from coming in, those either in the store as a customer or worker, could be susceptable to the Aside from the scaffolding, Peter can argue that the construction noise is interfering literally with the quiet enjoymet of the customers and workers of his pizza parlor.

With all the facts, Peter can even argue that because of the construction/repairs/acts of the landlord (in one way or another), he is facing a loss of customers and a drop in sales (as evidenced in his decreasing revenue). The delay in quickness of the deliveries may even deter customers from purchasing from this particular pizza shop. Further, his workers are losing their ability to do their job to the best of their ability/efficiently which could have a detrimental effect on not only the financial stability of the business but on the workers' financial well-being as well. I would advise Peter to first place his funds/rent in escrow as a precaution/safety measure. Further, though he does desires to not vacate the premises, I would advise him to leave the premises immediately. I would inform him that he must do so in order to potentially be successful in a breach of CQE claim; however, I would provide him with an err of caution- as abandoning the property could be a gamble. If the courts do not find the landlord to be in breach of CQE, then he will be liable for rent. My biggest piece of advice for him would to be to bring suit against Linda for damages, as he does not have the strongest partial eviction or constructive eviction claim. Peter cannot allege a breach of the implied of habitatbility (IWH) as the claim can only be applied to residential properties. ",669,1738
11c71cec-7410-4024-8f35-1a99bb9abd78," The first issue in this case is what interests are created by Dana's conveyance. Dana's conveyance is ambiguous and therefore requires analysis under the general rules of construction. Because Dana uses the words ""provided that"" and ""only so long as,"" Eve's interest is either a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) or a fee simple determinable (FSD). Depending on how the conveyance is interpreted, Dana (or her estate if she is to die) would have either a power of termination/right of entry or a possibility of reverter (POR) in fee simple absolute (FSA). First we must determine what Eve's interest is. A FSSCS is a present possessory interest in the property that gives the grantee the land in fee simple provided that a condition subsequent is not violated. In contrast, a FSD is a present possessory interest in the property that gives the grantee the land in fee simple so long as some limitation is not violated. Applying the rules of construction, Dana's conveywance would give Eve a FSSCS, as the rules favor a FSSCS over a FSD. This is in contrast to the Mahrenholtz case in which the IL court held that a FSD is prefered over a FSSCS. However, most jurisdictions abide to the general rules of construction and would favor a FSSCS. In this case, assuming New Suffolk is in a jurisdiction in which the general rules of contruction are followed, Dana's conveyance would give Eve a FSSCS. Assuming that Dana's conveyance gave Eve a FSSCS, this would give the grantor/estate a future interest of a power of termination or right of entry to Blackacre once the condition has been violated. A power of termination/right of entry requires that the grantor/estate affirmatively assert their right to re-take the property if the condition has been violated. The rules of construction disfavor the forefeiture of property when not necessary, so having the grantor/estate maintain a future interest that requires them to actually go back to Blackacre and assert their right to re-take the property is favored, as the present interest holder does not have to vacate if the condition has been violated until the grantor actually re- enters Blackacre. This is in contrast to a POR given by a FSD which automatically gives the grantor the right to the property the moment the condition has been violated. Therefore, in this case, giving Eve a FSSCS followed by a power of termination/right of entry in the grantor satisfies these rules of construction. Lastly, looking to the intent of Dana, the grantor, as required by the general rules of construction, it interest holder does not have to vacate if the condition has been violated until the grantor actually re- enters Blackacre. This is in contrast to a POR given by a FSD which automatically gives the grantor the right to the property the moment the condition has been violated. Therefore, in this case, giving Eve a FSSCS followed by a power of termination/right of entry in the grantor satisfies these rules of construction. Lastly, looking to the intent of Dana, the grantor, as required by the general rules of construction, it seems that she wishes Eve to have Blackacre ""provided that/so long as"" the house is not sold. In this case, Eve originally did not want to sell the house but is now considering it. These facts are analogous to those of White v. Brown in which the ambiguous conveyance of Ms. Lide required that the home be lived in and not be sold. The court in White required that the intent of the grantor be considered when defining the conveyance per the rules of construction. In this case, if Eve is to sell the house or at least try to, it appears that the grantor would wish Blackacre to revert back to her estate so that Blackacre is not sold and remains in her family. In that case, according to the jurisdiction of New Suffolk, the property would pass to Fiona, as she is Dana's issue, and assuming that no other administrator of Dana's estate is specified in her will. The rationale here is that in applying the rules of construction, the intent of the grantor is important in disecting ambiguous conveyances. If we are to apply this rationale of the rules of construction to this case, it would seem that if Eve attempts to sell Blackacre, Fiona, Dana's issue, would be able to retake the property and own it in FSA. Next, Eve has a strong argument for her interest of selling Blackacre. In particular, she could use the Doctrine of Waste to support her argument to sell the property. Specifically, she can argue she would be committing economic waste by not selling. This doctrine specifies that not using the land in the most economically productive way that property can be used for constitutes waste. In this case, after she finds out the property is worth a large sum of money from the real estate tax office because of its prime location in New Suffolk, the land has increased in value considerably. She can argue that she would be committing economic waste if she were to not sell it at that moment. This is similar to the Woodrick case in which by keeping the barn on the property, Wood would actually be detracting value from the property and thus should raze it. In this case, by not selling the property for the significantly increased value of what it is worth, Eve could claim she is committing economic waste by keeping it. The rationale here is that the law wants land to be used in the most productive way possible, and if it is not, then waste will be committed that impacts the interests of the future interest holders in the property. However, economic use of the property is not dispositive of what can be done with it.The rationale here is that the best interests of all the parties who own interests in the land should be considered when deciding what to do with it. THis is what the court in Baker v. Weedon determined when deciding if the property and thus should raze it. In this case, by not selling the property for the significantly increased value of what it is worth, Eve could claim she is committing economic waste by keeping it. The rationale here is that the law wants land to be used in the most productive way possible, and if it is not, then waste will be committed that impacts the interests of the future interest holders in the property. However, economic use of the property is not dispositive of what can be done with it.The rationale here is that the best interests of all the parties who own interests in the land should be considered when deciding what to do with it. THis is what the court in Baker v. Weedon determined when deciding if the future interest holders could sell the land later versus selling it now and allowing the life tenant to have some money in her old age upon which to live. In this case, Dana's daughter Fiona has a very sentimental attachment to the property her mother owned. Just like the life tenant was able to have her best interests of economic safety considered along with the future interest holders' interests of selling the land in total at a later date at a higher price, so too should Fiona's sentimental interest be considered in determining what to do with Blackacre. The next issue is whether Fiona has any basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre and holding Eve accountable for the repairs. Fiona has a strong argument that as Dana's issue she has an interest in the estate, as she would likely inherit the property if Eve violates the condition of attempting to sell Blackacre. If this is to be presumed, then Fiona can argue that if Eve tries to sell the home, she should be able to take ownership of Blackacre if she wants to according to the estate's right of re-entry granted by the conveyance. Further, Fiona could claim that Eve, who owns the property via Dana's conveyance is analogous to a landlord. If Fiona were to be allowed to live on the property while Eve is not there, as she lives in Florida and does not want to live on Blackacre anymore due to grief over the loss of Dana, Fiona would be Eve's tenant. According to this reasoning, Fiona could argue that Eve has committed waste by allowing the property to fall into a state of disrepair. In particular, she can argue that Eve has committed permissive waste by neglecting the property and letting it fall into the condition it is now, as the roof is damaged, the glass is cracked, and there are other serious problems to be fixed. This permissive waste argument could play a role in Fiona's potential argument that Eve has breached the landlord's duty to uphold the implied warranty of habitability a tenant has an unwaivable righ to. As a landlord, Eve would be responsible for upholding this warranty, which maintains that the premises must be in a basic condition in which a person can reasonably live. In this case, if Eve were to allow Fiona to live there as her ""tenant,"" Eve would be breaching the implied warranty of habitability if she were to not repair the damages. This is similar to the Hilder case in which the tenant lived in such an awful apartment that had plaster falling, broken glass, sewage in the basement, along with other deplorable conditions. The court argument could play a role in Fiona's potential argument that Eve has breached the landlord's duty to uphold the implied warranty of habitability a tenant has an unwaivable righ to. As a landlord, Eve would be responsible for upholding this warranty, which maintains that the premises must be in a basic condition in which a person can reasonably live. In this case, if Eve were to allow Fiona to live there as her ""tenant,"" Eve would be breaching the implied warranty of habitability if she were to not repair the damages. This is similar to the Hilder case in which the tenant lived in such an awful apartment that had plaster falling, broken glass, sewage in the basement, along with other deplorable conditions. The court there reasoned that it is the landlord's responsibility to fix the problems and provide a healthy place in which the tenant can live. The rationale was that as the landlord, he is more aware of the health codes and building codes in the jurisdiction, as well as with the property itself. In this case, if Fiona were Eve's tenant, Fiona could argue that Eve is responsible to fix the problems with Blackacre. If she does not, Fiona can sue her for damages, withhold any payments she may be making to Eve, seek rent abatement in the future, or argue that punititve damages be awared to her against Eve for violating her obligation as a landlord. Further, because Eve has essentially grown up on Blackacre with Dana, she may be more familiar with the premises and thus should be able to fix the problems. Fiona, on the other hand, although she grew up at Blackacre as well, left for college in 2003 and then moved to New York in 2010 and therefore has not be around the property for quite some time. Thus, she would not be as familiar with the property nor the building or health codes and therefore would be able to hold Eve accountable for the damages. However, this is a weak argument as well because Eve has also not lived on Blackacre for a long time and could argue as a result that she should not be responsible for fixing the damages under the rationale of Hilder. In conclusion, it is likely that Fiona has a claim that she should be allowed to retake Blackacre if Eve violates her present interest of a FSSCS by trying to sell it. Further, she may argue she can hold Eve accountable for the damages, as Eve is likely liable for committing permissive waste of the premises and also if Eve is to be analogized to Fiona's landlord, she is responsible for the implied warranty of habitability of the proeprty and thus is responsible for making the necessary repairs of Blackacre. "," Peter has some implicit rights as a tenant. First, he has a covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) of the premises. CQE provides that the tenant cannot be5deprived of his use of the property he is renting. If this covenant is violated, Peter has some options.

First, he has a covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) of the premises. CQE provides that the tenant cannot be deprived of his use of the property he is renting. If this covenant is violated, Peter has some options. He may be able to make an argument for actual eviction, constructive eviction, or at least damages if the conditions do not rise to that of a constructive eviction. In this case, Peter could argue that Linda's repairs constitute an actual eviction or a constructive eviction. First, it must be determined whether Peter can make an actual eviction claim. An actual eviction occurs when the landlord violates the tenant's CQE by physically coming into the space and limiting the tenant's use of the premises. In this case, Peter may argue that the large amount of scaffolding and the construction equipment used by the contractor Linda hired is depriving him of actually being able to use the premises for his pizza shop. The equipment encroaching on his parking space and the scaffolding largely blocking a door are similar to the brick wall that the landlord had built that crossed onto the proeprty line of the tenat in Smith v. McEnany. In that case, the brick wall constituted a partial actual eviction, as it physically deprived the tenant of his use of the premises thus breaching his CQE. The rationale there was that any deprivation of any part of the premises by the landlord essentially evicts the tenant from the whole of the premises, as the landlord cannot apportion the property. Therefore, the tenant would not be liable to pay rent for the entire premises. In this case, Peter can argue that this encroachment by the equipment and blocking of the door essentially deprive him of the entire premises, as he is barely able to park his car and customers cannot make it into the back door of the shop without dangerously navigating a maze of scaffolding. Therefore, if it is found that he has been actually evicted by this construction, Peter would not have to pay rent to Linda if he leaves the premises before his term of years tenancy is complete. However, there are some problems with this argument. First, Peter is still actually able to park in his spot, albeit not easily. Therefore, the landlord has not really encroached upon his space much. Next, even if it was found that Peter had been actually evicted by Linda's construction, he should still be liable to pay at least some rent to her, as he is still able to use the pizza shop. Under the restatement of property rationale mentioned in the notes after the Smith case, the landlord could apportion the rent so that the tenant is not paying for the parts of the premises which he has been actually evicted from but still paying for the parts he actually can use. Thus, because Peter is still technically able to use his shop, he may still be liable for some rent to Linda if it is found he has only been partially actually evicted. spot, albeit not easily. Therefore, the landlord has not really encroached upon his space much. Next, even if it was found that Peter had been actually evicted by Linda's construction, he should still be liable of to pay at least some rent to her, as he is still able to use the pizza shop. Under the restatement property rationale mentioned in the notes after the Smith case, the landlord could apportion the rent so that the tenant is not paying for the parts of the premises which he has been actually evicted from but still paying for the parts he actually can use. Thus, because Peter is still technically able to use his shop, he may still be liable for some rent to Linda if it is found he has only been partially actually evicted. Second, Peter may be able to argue that he has been constructively evicted from the premises. A construtive eviction requires that the tenant give the landlord notice of the problems, the problems be substantial, the landlord has a reasonable time to fix the problems but does not, and the tenant must leave in a reasonable amount of time. In this case, Peter has called Linda every week about the problems he has been having keeping his business running because of the construction she is doing on the building. Further, she said she would fix the problems within a week or two but that has not been the case. Also, Peter can argue the conditions are substantially depriving him of the intended use of the pizza shop because there is dust comming into the shop, it is very noisy and deterring customers, his delivery people cannot efficiently make deliveries because of the scaffolding and limited access to the shop, and he is being deprived of the profits his business typically generates without all of the construction going on that prevent customers from coming into the shop to buy pizza. These conditions are similar to those in Echo Consulting, where the tenant had very limited access to the premises because of ongoing construction the landlord/bank was undergoing. In that case, Echo was not able to claim a constructive eviction because they still had access and the ability to actualy use the premises as office space. In this case, Peter does have access to the shop despite the barriers; however, the conditions of Peter's business as a result of the construction seem to be more substantial than those Echo endured, as the shop has likely become unsanitary because of the dust, many customers do not go into the shop because it is so hard to access thus prohibiting Peter from using it for its intended purpose as a restaurant, and also the construction has been going on for months with no end in sight. Peter's case seems to be more aligned factually with Reste Realty in which the tenant was able to validly claim constructive eviction because of the recurring flooding in the space that made it almost impossible to continue using. In this case, it seems that the conditions of Peter's shop are as substantial as the flooding in rest because he is being deprived of the use of his shop, just as the tenant was deprived of the use of the office for her work. The rationale here is that the tenant has been so substantially deprived of the intended use of the premises that the landlord 9 effectively evicted him from the premises and has thus the tenant should not be liable for rent/damages. However, the weakness of this argument is that the construction is technically not permanent just as the flooding was not permanent and thus he cannot claim constructive eviction because of the recurring flooding in the space that made it almost impossible to continue using. In this case, it seems that the conditions of Peter's shop are as substantial as the flooding in rest because he is being deprived of the use of his shop, just as the tenant was deprived of the use of the office for her work. The rationale here is that the tenant has been so substantially deprived of the intended use of the premises that the landlord has effectively evicted him from the premises and thus the tenant should not be liable for rent/damages. However, the weakness of this argument is that the construction is technically not permanent just as the flooding was not permanent and thus he cannot make as strong of a constructive eviction claim. Though the construction could be argued to be essentially permanent as it has been going on for months and Linda has not given him a definitive answer to when it will end. Thus, just as the flooding in Reste, though temporary, was ongoing and came to a point where she could not use the premises any longer, Peter's temporary prevention of full use of his pizza shop is likely substantial enough to raise a valid constructive eviction defense against Linda who would likely sue him for rent if he abandons the premises before his lease is up. Thus, Peter has notified the landlord of the problems constantly to no avail, he has been giving her a reasonable amount of time to fix them, as he has waited every time she tells him it will only be a few more days, and the conditions are arguably substantial enough that he cannot continue to use the pizza shop. Thus, if Peter notifies the landlord and vacates the premises as is required by a constructive eviction, it will have been a reasonable amount of time in which he has left and therefore he could make a valid constructive eviction claim. Further, if it is found that Peter has neither been actually evicted or constructively evicted, he may still be able to sue Linda for damages as a result of her interference with his tenancy. Lastly, if Peter does in fact vacate the premises and it is found that he does not have a valid constructive eviction claim nor an actual eviction, Linda still has a duty to mitigate damages that would accrue after he vacates while the term of years is not up. If Peter leaves, he will still be liable for rent for the time after he vacates the premises prematurely. However, Linda would have to take reasonable measures to find a new tenant in order to mitigate the damages Peter owes her for vacating. This is similar to Sommer v. Kridel where the tenant surrendered the premises due to a failed marriaged and not being able to afford the rent. Instead of accepting the surrender thus alleviating the tenant of his duty to pay rent, the landlord treated it as though the tenant had abandoned the property and subsequently sued him for the rent he owed for the entire term of his lease. However, the landlord did not take any steps to re- and did not put out any ads. Thus, if Linda let the apartment, as he turned prospective tenants8 away does not take reasonable efforts to find a new tenant if Peter does vacate, Peter will not be liable to her for all of the term's rent because she failed to complete her duty as a landlord to mitigate damages.

Thus, if Linda does not take reasonable efforts to find a new tenant if Peter does vacate, Peter will not be liable to her for all of the term's rent because she failed to complete her duty as a landlord to mitigate damages. In conclusion, I would advise Peter to vacate the premises if he is unable to bear the ongoing construction due to not being able to afford to lose more business because of lack of customers as a result of the construction. If Linda sues him for rent, then I would advise Peter to raise the defense of a constructive eviction against Linda, as this is the best claim he can make that would allow him to not lose money if he moves. Further, I would tell Peter of the potential risks a construtive eviction claim would entail, including losing that claim and being liable for Linda's rent as well as any other place he would be paying rent for the shop. As a result, I would also advise Peter to put the money he would owe per month for the rest of the term lease aside, possibly in escrow, in case a court finds that his constructive eviction claim is not valid. That would allow him to still have some money to fall back on to pay Linda for rent if he does in fact decide he wants to move. ",2066,2129
1b15cca5-b292-4c29-8e83-384ed76e7b77," The first issue is what type of interest did Dana create when she created the conveyance. When someone holds an interest in a property they will either have a present interest of a future interest. A present interest allows the person to have rights to the property at the moment in time to, generally do what they please. A future interest is an interest that will become possessory in the future at the happpening of a certain event. Interests are usually conveyed in documents such as deeds and wills. When reading these deeds there are general rules of interpration to determine what type of interest- present or future- will be held by the parties. The rules are to try and look at the intent of the grantor- the person conveying the property. To favor a fee simple absolute over a life estate, allow for alienability, avoid partial intestacy, favor fee simple subject condition precedent over fee simple determinable, and to find vested remainders over contingent remainders. The policy rationale in following these rules is to provide structure, certainty, and govern ambigious situation between disputing parties. There are types of present interests and future interest. When looking at the present interest, you will have the Fee Simple Absolute or the champion of all estates. This is the champion of all estates because it is the closest thing our property system has to absolute owensherip in land. Further the Fee simple allows the owner to do what they please with the property because its theirs and of course the Fee Simple has no future interest accompanied with it. This is created when the conveyances uses fors ""To A and their heirs."" After the FSA at common law was the fee tail, or the the bald person has no hairs property doctrine. This present interest would mean that a property is to be passed down to heirs and in the vent there was no heirs to claim the property, it would revert back to the grantor. This type of present interest is largely extinct and when found in an ambigious conveyance it is determined to be a fee simple absolute. Next is the life estate. This is a present interest measured for the duration of someones life and generally has a future interest known as reversion. That means that at the death of the life tenant, the property will become possessory back to the grantor. You can transfer a life estate to someone else which is known as a life estate in autre vie- meaning that the new possessor of the life estate will have the possession of prooperty until the death of the orginal holder of that life estate. The orginal grantor iwll actually have a no heirs to claim the property, it would revert back to the grantor. This type of present interest is largely extinct and when found in an ambigious conveyance it is determined to be a fee simple absolute. Next is the life estate. This is a present interest measured for the duration of someones life and generally has a future interest known as reversion. That means that at the death of the life tenant, the property will become possessory back to the grantor. You can transfer a life estate to someone else which is known as a life estate in autre vie- meaning that the new possessor of the life estate will have the possession of prooperty until the death of the orginal holder of that life estate. The orginal grantor iwll actually have a reversion in FSA. A life estate is created when the conveyance reads ""to A for life."" Next we have the tenancy- or non free hold estates (which the distinction doesnt even matter mcuh anymore) but these are typical leases. They can be tenancy of years, periodic, and tenancy at will. These don't seem to apply to our case. Next are the present defeaseible interest. An interest is defeasible if it could possibly last forever but also could be cut short. The first is the Fee Simple Determinable. This type of present interest is created with durational language such as ""as long"" as or ""while."" When a FSD condition, allowing for the present interest to be held is violated, that interest no longer exsists and the grantor repossess the property immidetaly. This is called a possibility of reverter. This is important because adverse possession could begin right away when true present interest reverts back to the grantor in FSA. The second type of defeasible present interest is the Fee Simple Subject Conditon Subsquent. This type of present interest is created on conditional language such as ""provided that"" or ""but if."" When a condition is violated, that present possessory interest remains, until the grantor excerises their future interest right under the right of rentry or power of termination in FSA. This policy rationale is also important here because adverse posession can't begin until that right is excerised, thus making it more difficult for the AP to occur. At common law these types of defeasible present interest were not transferable but modern law now does allow them to be transfered. The last type of defeasible interest is the Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation. This conveyance can be created with langaue similar and is similar in nature to both the FSD and FSSCS but insted of the future interest being held by the grantor, it is held by a third party. The future interest being the executory interest. Applying these rules to the the facts, you should start by reading the intent of Dana in her conveyance. does allow them to be transfered. The last type of defeasible interest is the Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation.

The future interest being the executory interest. Applying these rules to the the facts, you should start by reading the intent of Dana in her conveyance. When she writes the conveyance she uses both conditional and durational language. In using the rules of conveyance with this ambigious deed the court will likely determine that Eve now owns the property in Fee Simple Absolute and also does not have a restraint on alienability. (A restraint on alieanbility does not allow for the present possessor to do away with the property at the terms of the conveyor. The farther away from FSA the more likely a court will allow for a restraint on alienability to be in place). This is becuase courts generally favor property to conveyed fully and allow for people to do what they please with it. This is similar ton the finding in the White v. Brown case where Anna White was found by the state supreme court to have obtained a FSA over a life estate. Using the reasoning that courts perfer the FSA with no restraints on alienability and in line with the intent of the conveyor to keep th eproperty in the family as stated in the fact pattern then the court would likely find for Eve, thus allowing her to do what she wants with the property. However, Fiona arguing that her mothers intent was to truly keep the property in the family could perhaps show that she has a Fee Simple Determinable because that conditon, when violated at the time Fiona attempts to sell the property, reverts back to the grantor under the possibility of reverter (in this case the grantors heirs Fiona) or that the conveyance allows for FSSCS and a right of renentry. USing the dissent from White v Brown Eve could suggest that clearly Dana knew how to gift and transfer property when she repeated that the house not be sold. Therefore the prior statement based on durational and conditinal language created a defeasible interest and not a FSA. Again, I think it is unlikely that FIona prevails under these arguments. Second issue is that Fiona could attempt to argue that she does have a future interest in the property and that the way in Eve is treating it allows for a claim of waste. A claim of waste can be brought by a future interest holder against someone excerising their present interest over that piece of property. THe laws of waste state that the present owner has the duty and obligation to not allow the property to be damaged in a capacity that effects the future interest holder interest. Specifically Fiona using the facts from the case could argue that the there was affirmative waste, permissive waste, no ammerotive waste, and she would probably not bring up economic waste (economic waste means that the property is not being used to its full economic potential- this may be a stronger argument for Eve as it shows that if she does that the way in Eve is treating it allows for a claim of waste. A claim of waste can be brought by a future interest holder against someone excerising their present interest over that piece of property. THe laws of waste state that the present owner has the duty and obligation to not allow the property to be damaged in a capacity that effects the future interest holder interest. Specifically Fiona using the facts from the case could argue that the there was affirmative waste, permissive waste, no ammerotive waste, and she would probably not bring up economic waste (economic waste means that the property is not being used to its full economic potential- this may be a stronger argument for Eve as it shows that if she does not sell the property should be allowing for the property to waste as it sits there) as the property is used for personal property use in her mind and not fungible. PErsonal property can be replaced by market value while fungible property can not. Using the argument from the Barn case the Fiona could argue that the property is not be wasted or sold because their is multiple considerations to take into account- not just the economic benefit of a party but the personal attachment somone has with the land. Affirmative waste occurs when a present interest holder acts voluntary to alter and chnage the property in a way that devalues the property. Using the fact Eve voluntary took off to Florida and let the house suffer through the cold winter would show that she allowed the property to occur damages. Permissive waste is more negligectful and requires in action from the present interest holder. This is a more suitable argument because Eve took off and didnt keep the property maintence in her mind- allowing for windows to crack and shingles to break. Ammerotive waste is more contorversial because although the alteration done by the present interest holder changes the property, is creates and rises the property value. There is nothing that Eve did that would allow her to argue for Ammerotive waste becuase in suggesting that Eve attempted to do add value to the property would suggest that the conditon holding her interest in place was violated before the waste could occur. Because these arguments rest on facts that assume Fiona has a future interest I do not believe the court would find that Fiona has any claims of violation of law of waste. "," When Peter calls I would suggest to him that he has many rights under this current situation. Peter has a tenancy of years as indicted by his lease argeement using fixed dates. I would inform him that althogh he could possibly have an argument for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, he does not have as strong a case against breach of implied warrant of habitability. Usually similar facrs will be used to show both rights were violated. IMW is a narrow doctrine as it only applies to residential properties and will not be used for commerical property. It can not be waived by parties and is read into the document when not expressly stated. The tenancy of years as indicted by his lease argeement using fixed dates. I would inform him that althogh he could possibly have an argument for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, he does not have as strong a case against breach of implied warrant of habitability. Usually similar facrs will be used to show both rights were violated. IMW is a narrow doctrine as it only applies to residential properties and will not be used for commerical property. It can not be waived by parties and is read into the document when not expressly stated. The dooctrine of IMW protects tenants from living conditions that are substandard and put the tenant in harm or health concern. A violation of local health condition is an obvious violation. If this was a residential property he would have many remedies as long as he was in grave concern for his health. Usually the IMW requires that the landlords conduct substantially impact the standard of quality of living on the tenant and the tenant notifies the landlord of the problem, and giving the landlord a reasonable time to fix the issue. The tenant does not actually have to leave the property instead they can withold rent and place it in escrow, hoping that when the potentail dispute is resolved they will have money to pay rent at another place. Additionally a tenant could fix the issues themselves and reduct the total from that months renth which is desireable if the tenant does not want to relocate. The tenant could also look to readjust the rent accordingly to the issues. An analysis of IMW is not proper here because of course this is a commercial property. The policy rationale here is that we want to allow for people who are not as well off to not be taken advatange of and enjoy property rights and that tenant and landlords are mutually dependant on eachother as any contract usually is. The more proper argument that Peter could claim is the breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment. This covenant is a promise by a landlord, commerical and residential, that the tenant using the property will be able to enjoy peaceful and beneficially as intended. The breach of CQE requires that an interference is substantial, that the interefence is actually committed by the landlord or someone acting on their behalf, that the tenant gave the landlord reasonable notice and the landlord is given a reasonable amount of time to address the issues, and lastly the tenant abdandons the property. (Abandonment means that the tenant just leaves the property without the permission of the landlord and this will usually result in an action against the tenant such a s breach of contract, where as surrender is when the tennat asks to be released from the landlord tenant contract and the landlord accepts.) I would advise Peter the abandoning of property is very risky because if the court finds that a breach of CQE did not occur and Petetr brings his Pizza place to another location- he could be liable to two rents. All types of monetory remedies are on the table here- punitive and compenstatory chief among them When arguing that CQE has occured Peter could suggest that he expierenced an actual partial eviction, action against the tenant such a s breach of contract, where as surrender is when the tennat asks to be released from the landlord tenant contract and the landlord accepts.) I would advise Peter the abandoning of property is very risky because if the court finds that a breach of CQE did not occur and Petetr brings his Pizza place to another location- he could be liable to two rents. All types of monetory remedies are on the table here- punitive and compenstatory chief among them When arguing that CQE has occured Peter could suggest that he expierenced an actual partial eviction, he was construcively evicted, and at the very least he deserves damages. An actual partial eviction occurs when there is an actual physical impediement into the property- the argument will be stronger if it actually limits the use of the property. But at the end of the day, when making this argument the strnegth of the phycial incroachment will not be ased on how much it limits your use but on the fact it exsists. The rationale behind this is that when a tenant leases a property they are paying the rent for each square inch of that property. Applying these rules to the facts it seems that because there was a large scaffholding blocking the door for pizza delvieries, Peter and his pizza people were not able to use the property as intended. Using the Reste Realty case reasoning, although that case argued for constructive eviction, the intereference was not permanet but substantial meaning that perhaps the court would find that the scaffholding is not permanent it was a physical incroachment breaching CQE. However, the fact that Peter still had access to the building, albeit limited, shows that partial actual eviction never occured. Using the reasoning from Conway, the court found in doing a plain reading of the lease that the lease provided for at least one door access on the property to be avialable so although a doorway was blocked the lease was not actually violated. Again this reasoning was used to show constructive eviction in that case but for the same reasoning I believe it holds and that the court would not find an actual partial eviction to have occured. Because Peter car space is impedied on slighltly and his lease promises that hell gave the ability perhaps the court would find that he was actually was partial evicted and therefore released from the lease. Due to the fact that Peter can still Park there however tight, the court is likely to side with Linda. Next when arguing CQE you argue that the tenant has been constructively evicted. To be constructively evicted means that the landlord allowed for your enjoyment to be substaintially interferred with to the point it was ""as if"" yopu had been kicked off the property. To be constructively evicted again the impediment not have to be permanent but substantial. Here there seems to be a substantial impediment as evdienced by the dust coming in through the windows, the company now having fewer customers, were so bad that his covenant would be broken and staff troubles. Peter would suggest that conditions and he has the right to leave and abandon the property with the abatement of rent. Whereas Linda would suggest that breach of CQE did not occur but if it did perhaps a renogiation of rent is the proper evicted means that the landlord allowed for your enjoyment to be substaintially interferred with to the point it was ""as if"" yopu had been kicked off the property. To be constructively evicted again the impediment not have to be permanent but substantial. Here there seems to be a substantial impediment as evdienced by the dust coming in through the windows, the company now having fewer customers, and staff troubles. Peter would suggest that conditions were so bad that his covenant would be broken and he has the right to leave and abandon the property with the abatement of rent. Whereas Linda would suggest that breach of CQE did not occur but if it did perhaps a renogiation of rent is the proper remedy seeing that there still remains mutliple years on the commercial lease. Damages is the last and strongest argument I would make for Peter. Damages are rewarded to tenants when the level of behavior by the landlord does not rise to constructive eviction but still the tenant suffered some harm. Due to lack of sufficientcy in his business, most likely causing him to lose money as evidenced by lack of customers, the court would likely find that some type of damages should be awarded. Perhaps he could get a few months rent free based off this inconvience and possibly lost income (compenstory). Peter will likely have to stay in the lease but will be awarded some damages for his suffering. ",1902,1471
e19da49e-8359-4c3e-b944-c6116efca7c1," Essay 1: 1A: Dana's Conveyance The first issue is, determining what kind of conveyance Dana created when she conveyed Blackacre to Eve? Typically, a conveyance would contain specific language that indicates what type of conveyance was created, however, some conveyances can be ambiguous and the courts look to the rules of construction for guidance when it is not clear what has been created. In this present case, Dana's language is unclear, in terms of a conveyance. She uses both conditional language and durational language in her convayance when she states ""provided that"" and ""only so long as"", thus, the conveyance is ambiguous and the next step is to look at the rules of construction. On the one hand, the conveyance could be construed as being a FSDeteriminable by the use of durational language. In that case, Dana would have a possibility of reverter. On the other hand, Dana's use of conditional language such as ""provided that"" would have conveyed a FSSCS and therefore would have created a power of termination/ right of entry in herself as the condition of selling the house is possible, but not necessarily guaranteed to happen. In the present case, one could use the rules of construction to decipher the true intent of Dana. Here Dana's conveyance repeats the term ""the house is not to be sold."" We can infer from the repitition that this is an important condition upon which Eve is to maintain her interest in Blackacre. If Eve should attempt to sell the house, then she would lose Blackacre. This is similar to White v. Brown, where a family member conveyed her house to another family member, and reiterated that the house was not to be sold. The conveyance was also ambiguous and therefore, the courts looked to the rules of construction, specifically, the intent of the original owner who conveyed the property to determine what interests the conveyance created. Again, it seems that Dana's intent of conveying Blackacre to Eve is conditioned upon Eve not attempting to sell the house. If this inference is correct, Dana's intended to create a FSSCP with the power of termination/right of entry being held by Dana (before her untimely death). 1B: Fiona's basis to Reclaim: With the untimely death of Dana, Fiona could make the argument that Dana's power of termination/right who conveyed the property to determine what interests the conveyance created. Again, it seems that Dana's intent of conveying Blackacre to Eve is conditioned upon Eve not attempting to sell the house. If this inference is correct, Dana's intended to create a FSSCP with the power of termination/right of entry being held by Dana (before her untimely death). 1B: Fiona's basis to Reclaim: With the untimely death of Dana, Fiona could make the argument that Dana's power of termination/right of entry has passed on to her. If thats the case, then Fiona would take over Dana's power of termination and could make the case that Eve's offer from the real estate developer constitutes an attempt to sell the house, thus, Fiona has the right to retake the property because Eve had broken the condition. Additionally, Fiona's possibility of reverter interest in Blackacre means that Eve has the obligation of returning the land to Fiona in the same condition upon which she receieved it. Since the house was left unkempt and in the harsh winter weather of New Suffolk, Fiona has a case for requesting Eve make the repairs needed for her to move back in to avoid the effects of permissive waste on the property. In a similar case (barn demolishion case) certain family members wanted to demolish an old barn that had fallen into disrepair, although tearing down the barn would have raised the property value, the court did not allow the barn to be tore down as it would have altered the original condition of the property and deteriorated the sentimental value held by one family member. Although, in this case were talking about permissive waste and in the barn case hinged on ameliorative waste, the concept of the current possessor's obligation to pass on the property to the future interest in the same or similar condition remains the same. 1C: Eve's argument to Solicite more offers: However, Fiona's interest would only be possible, in this case, IF the call from the real estate developer could be construed as an ""attempt"" on Fiona's part to sell the house. One could argue that a third party reaching out to solicite an offer is not the current possessor of the land's attempt to sell the property. Eve did not reach out to the developer or solicite offers for the property. In fact, she did what she could to keep the property in her possession by putting the tax patments on auto-pay so that she could maintain an active interest in the house and property without becoming derelict in her duties as the current possessor of Blackacre. Even if she solicited other offers, does that constitute an attempt to sell? Perhaps she is curious and would just like to know what the value of the property is worth. Additionally, the rules of construction favor a fee simple absolute. If the court decides that this rule of construction is a better fit for Dana's conveyance, which could be a possibility, as a policy rationale, as to keep the property in her possession by putting the tax patments on auto-pay so that she could maintain an active interest in the house and property without becoming derelict in her duties as the current possessor of Blackacre. Even if she solicited other offers, does that constitute an attempt to sell? Perhaps she is curious and would just like to know what the value of the property is worth. Additionally, the rules of construction favor a fee simple absolute. If the court decides that this rule of construction is a better fit for Dana's conveyance, which could be a possibility, as a policy rationale, as it would make future conveyances much more simple and clear. If the court decides this is a conveyance to Dana in fee simple absolute, Eve wouldnt be subject to the ""not to be sold"" portion of the conveyance. Blackacre would be conveyed to Eve in FSA, and Eve, subsequently would be able to do whatever she pleased with the property/house. Fiona, in that case, would have no longer have an interest in Blackacre, unless Eve were to convey some interest to her at a future point in time. "," 2A: Peter's Strengths for Leaving: Peter could argue that he has been constuctively evicted and partially/actually evicted from his term of years lease space due to the noise and obstruction created by construction and scaffolding. His partial actual eviction is from the parking lot as he has lost some space that was specifically guaranteed as part of his lease. He know considers the space to be a ""tight squeeze"" and is no longer able to use the area he previously had access to. Moreover, Peter has been constructively evicted due to the noise, scaffolding and dust from the construction. Even though he wasn't actually asked to leave the premises, the inconvenience of running a pizza place in a construction zone could rise to the level of a breach of CQE and IWH. The dust in the pizza place would create uninhabitable conditions for making the pizza, and would constitute a breach as Peter would not be able to efficiently and/or economically perform the duties necessary to run his business. He is also not able to effectively deliver pizza and has noticed that less and less customers have been buying pizza. While in a residential area these conditions may not rise to the level of a breach of quiet enjoyment or the implied warranty of habitibility, but clean, sanitary, and peaceful conditions are necessary for the successful operation of a business, but especially a pizza shop or any place of business that is providing food for public consumption - a pizza shop for which the landlord agreed to rent to Peter knowing he would be operating a pizza shop. Additionally, Peter has followed the proper steps to for breaking his lease. He had given the landlord notice that he was unhappy with the repairs and had given the landlord a reasonable amount of time to of quiet enjoyment or the implied warranty of habitibility, but clean, sanitary, and peaceful conditions are necessary for the successful operation of a business, but especially a pizza shop or any place of business that is providing food for public consumption - a pizza shop for which the landlord agreed to rent to Peter knowing he would be operating a pizza shop. Additionally, Peter has followed the proper steps to for breaking his lease. He had given the landlord notice that he was unhappy with the repairs and had given the landlord a reasonable amount of time to complete such repairs, similar to that of the Echo Consulting case. The landlord's repeated promises that the construction would be over soon has since been delayed by weeks and months. In this case, that is not reasonable to wait weeks or months when the landlord originally promised Peter that the repairs would only take a week, which Peter was more than willing to endure since he decided to take the week off and close the shop for the temporary project. Since the construction has carried on for months with no end in sight, Peter has a reasonable claim for ending his lease with the landlord or at the very least for requesting a more substantial reduction in his monthly rent as this has surpassed a minor inconvenience or ""hassle"" as the landlord describes. 2B: Peter's Weaknesses for Leaving: The landlord upheld obligation/duty to mitigate expenses and offered Peter $100 for the hassle of having to deal with the construction. When a tenant is partially evicted from a given space, the court will allow a deduction of rent to be made from the monthly total but only an amount that is proportionate to the area the tenant was partially evicted from. Since Peter was partially evicted from some space in the parking lot, the Landlord's small deduction is proportionate to the amount of space Peter no longer has access to. This deduction in rent was similar to a case involving a garage or brick wall that was built a few inches over the property line of the tenant's leased property. In that case, the landlord reduced the rent of the tenant as she was unable to enjoy all of the area that she was promised in the lease. Additionally, the construction does not completely violate or interfere with Peter's quiet enjoyment of the property. The landlord has a duty to deliver all the property in livable conditions via the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment and Implied Warranty of Habitability. In this case, Peter is still able to access the pizza shop and make deliveries. It may not be as convenient as it was before construction, but minor inconveniences of this nature would likely not rise to a breach of CQE or IWH. This is similar to the Reste Realty case where the bank argued that they were partially evicted because they no longer had access to a door they shared ""in common"" with the the building. The court ruled that because rest they still had access to the building, just through a different door, that did not qualify as an actual eviction. Similarly, Peter may be inconvenienced, but he is still able to access the pizza shop and Quiet Enjoyment and Implied Warranty of Habitability. In this case, Peter is still able to access the pizza shop and make deliveries. It may not be as convenient as it was before construction, but minor inconveniences of this nature would likely not rise to a breach of CQE or IWH. This is similar to the Reste Realty case where the bank argued that they were partially evicted because they no longer had access to a door they shared ""in common"" with the rest of the building. The court ruled that because they still had access to the building, just through a different door, that did not qualify as an actual eviction. Similarly, Peter may be inconvenienced, but he is still able to access the pizza shop and conduct business. Even if the landlord did violate Peter's CQE and IWH, the landlord could argue that the rental of a commercial space does not afford Peter the same rights and protections of properties used in residential buildings. Commercial buildings will invitably experience typical noises and disruptions customary of being located in an area of commercial use. This may be noise, construction, loud neighbors, unavailable parking and therefore, the landlord does not have the same duties and obligations as those in residential properties. Finally, Peter's term of years lease would require him to give substantial notice in advance before he could technically leave. ",1082,1078
ebf4deeb-44b2-4c4d-992e-b4e44cda8cc9," Dana's Conveyance In ambiguious conveyances, the court uses the rules of construction to determine its meaning. In the present matter, Dana's conveyance is ambiguous, for it uses conditional language, ""provided that"", suggesting a Eve has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent with a right of re- entry AND uses durational language, ""so long as"", limiting how the land can be used. This durational lanuage suggests a fee simple determinable with the possibility of reverter. In the Marhenzhols case, the convyenace was amibguous, like it is here, for there clause denoting the use of the land for school purposes only, however, the language very similary contained both conditional and durational language. In that matter, the case did not follow the rule of construction- that fee simple condition subsequent should be favored over a fee simple determinable. Typically, fee simple condition subsequent is favored because the future interest in the right or re- entry. Courts are hostile in having restraints on alienability and with right of re- entry the fututre interest must act on their perogative to trigger the right of re-entry, making it less like that the land will be trasferred, because it is not automatic, as the possibility of reverter is, which follows fee simple determinable. If the court follows the ruling in the Marhenholz case and goes against the rules of destruction, it is likely they Dana will have a fee simple determinable followed by a possibiliy of reverter, which would be held by Eve, the daughter who inherits the personal property of the Grantor. In White v. Brown, the court follows the rules of construction and explicitly emphasizes the intent of the grantor. In this matter, it is apparent that Dana does not want the house to be sold. The other rules of construction are (1) intent of the grantor, (2) avoid partial intestacy, (3) favor fee simple abosulte, (4) favor fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) over fee simple determimanle (FSD), (5) favor vested remainders over contingent remainders, (6) read the document as a whole and (7) avoid restraints on alienability. The most prevelant rules in this matter is the intent of the grantor which is to keep the house within the familiy, and for it to not be sold and to favor FSSCS over FSD. If the court here were to follow the ruling in White v. Brown, Dana would have the present possessory interest: FSSCS, where if the condition were broke, the house were to be sold, then Eve would have the right to re- entry or power of termination in which she must 9 on her right to obtain possession. act Permitted to solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre restraints on alienability. The most prevelant rules in this matter is the intent of the grantor which is to keep the house within the familiy, and for it to not be sold and to favor FSSCS over FSD. If the court here were to follow the ruling in White v. Brown, Dana would have the present possessory interest: FSSCS, where if the condition were broke, the house were to be sold, then Eve would have the right to re- entry or power of termination in which she must act on her right to obtain possession. Permitted to solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre If it is found that Dana holds the present possessory interest in fee simple subject to condition subsequent, then upon attempt to sell the house, the right of re- entry is triggered and Eve has the option to act on her right to possess the premises. In this present matter, Dana can argue that merely hearing offers is not an attempt to sell. AN attempt to sell may be more evident if she were to places advertise or show the house. Thus, if it is found that this is not an attempt, or a substanital step to sell, then Eve cannot act on her right of re- entry. In addition, Dana can show that she intended to keep the house in the family for she did not sell it upon her move to Florida and following the move she set up a real estate tax auto pay to pay annually for the taxes on the property. If the court were to follow the Baker v. Weedon case, it is important to note the interest of all aprties, both present and future interest holders. In that matter, the interests holders disagreed as to the sale of the land. The court in fairness suggested equittable relief, and selling a part of the land fulfilling both parties interest of giving financial support to the seller of the land and keeping the future interest in the land by keeping a portion, for the remaindermen noted that the price of the land would increase substantially upon a highway bypass. Here,if the aprties discovered some type of equittable relief this may be possible. Howev Fiona's basis for reclaiming ownership/ Holding Eve accountable for reparis Fiona, whether it is determined to be a possibliity of revert or right of re- entry, does hold a future interest in the land. According to the Baker v. Weedon case, it is important to balance the interest of all parties, presnet and fufture interest holders. In that case, the present possessory interest holder sought to sell the land for financial reasons while the fufture interestvholders did not want to sell for their would be a skyrovcket in price to the land upon the building of a highway bypass. The court noted that all interests of the parties were important. The court reasoned in equity and suggested an eqiuttable relief, in which part of the land may be sold to give finaicial support to the presernt possessory owner, while the rest was not sold to satisfy the future nterest holders, a fair result.This must be present in the interest in the land. According to the Baker v. Weedon case, it is important to balance the interest of all parties, presnet and fufture interest holders.

The court reasoned in equity and suggested an eqiuttable relief, in which part of the land may be sold to give finaicial support to the presernt possessory owner, while the rest was not sold to satisfy the future nterest holders, a fair result.This must be present in the deliberation as to what to do with the property moving forward, to sell or not. Accoridng the the waste doctrine, the present possessory interest holder must keep the property in good condition, practically the same as when they got it, so when the future interests receive the property it is up to their expectations. There are four types of waste. The first is voluntary/ affirmative waste, which is intentional destruction of property. Normal wear and tear of property is . expected and does not fall into this category. This would not apply in this matter, for Dana did nothing to purposelly harm the property. However, Foina can argue that there was permissive waste on behalf of Dana. Permissive waste is neglect in which the tenant of the property does not take care of the premises through basic repairs or upkeep. Fiona can state that Dana truly neglected the property by locking it up and moving to another state for five years. Such neglect is apparent in the conditions of the house for there are roof shingles missing, the glass is craked, and other serious issues. Fiona may be able to collect damages based on this for it does not meet her expectations as a future interest holder, holding Eve accounrtable for the repairs as she neglected the property Fiona has a fututre interest in. Ameloriative waste is when changes are made uniltarerally by the present possessory interest that enchances the value of the property. In this case, Dana was absent for five years and did not enhance the strucutre at all, therefore there is no amerliorative waste. In contrast to Fiona's waste doctrine arguments, Dana may be able to argue that there is economic waste. Economic waste is waste that does put the land to productive use. In this case, the house may be determined to be economic waste, for it is falling apart and the value of the land may be increased if the house were to be destroyed, suggesting that there really isn't much economic value. However, Fiona can state that she does have a sentimental tie to the property, for it reminded her of her deceased mother who sought to keep it within the family, as her last dying wish. Following the Baker v. Weedon case, it would be in Fiona's best interest to keep it within the family and therefore it should not be sold. In regards to this however, Dana can note that the house does not necessarily ADD value to the land. ALthough it has value, Dana can suggest that in fairness of all parties, just like the farm house case where the farm did not add value to the property, that she could sell the property and deduct the valued house price from the overall sale and give it to Fiona. state that she does have a sentimental tie to the property, for it reminded her of her deceased mother who sought to keep it within the family, as her last dying wish.

"," Peter's Arguments The lease is the matter is a tenancy in years. It is for a fixed term, Jan. 1, 2019 until Dec. 31, 2023, does not renew at the end of the calendar dates, and ends automatically upon the last day specified. This is a comemrical lease. The covenant of quiet enojyment is a implied agreement in all commerical and residential leases that obliges the landlord (LL) to refrain from interfering with the tenant's (T) beneficial use or enjoyment of the premises. Such interference can be an action or inaction. Action would be direct intereference with the premises to prevent use, such as construction. Inaction is LL's remiss or lack of action, such as not following the contract obligations or legal obligations such as not holding the land up to the building code standards. With the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the LL also has the duty to repair the premises over the length of the tenancy. If the damage is due to the tenant the LL is not liable. Although the old common law rule suggest that paying rent is an independant covenant from maintaing repairs, the court no longer follows this rule as they adopt the modern trend in which they are mutaully dependant. If the LL breaches the T can suspend rent. The rationale for the modern trend is that as a tenant there are certain expectations created in a rental agreement and as a tenant you do not have the same maintencance knwoeldge as the LL. The courts follow this new contract trend, holding the LL liable for breaches. It is important to note that the implied warrant of habitability, which states the LL must make repairs and keep the premises' in a safe and healthy condition thorughout the term of the tenancy, does not apply here. For this only applies to human dwellings. Hence the term habitaliy. The duties of the tenant are, to not invoke waste and to pay rent. breaches. It is important to note that the implied warrant of habitability, which states the LL must make repairs and keep the premises' in a safe and healthy condition thorughout the term of the tenancy, does not apply here. For this only applies to human dwellings. Hence the term habitaliy. The duties of the tenant are, to not invoke waste and to pay rent. In the present matter, Peter can argue that the LL is breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE), by interfering with his beneficial use- using the pizza shop for in house and deliveries sales. This is just like the brick wall case, where the LL slightly infringe on the property of the tenant preventing complete use of the entire leased area, the court held that such interference and small encroachment prevented the T from beneficial use of the whole, breaching the contract and the CQE and constituting ana actual- partial eviction. In this matter, Peter can argue that the hvaing to navigate within the premises due to scaffolding everywhere is an actual- partial eviction in which the direct actions of the LL of allowing the construction company to use the area, constitutes a breach of CQE. The court in the brick wall case reasoned that an actual- partial eviction suspends rent because as a T there are expectattions to use the premises and enjoy it and it you cannot enjoy it in its entirety one shouyld not be expected to pay rent. The court also suggested in that matter, changing the terms of the lease to lower the price because it only was a de mimimus encroachment, this would apply here, for the construction equiment slightly encroaches on his designated parking spot, prevent complete use of the premised area. With this Peter, has an argument to argue that the LL breached the CQE for there is an actual - partial eviction and he should thereby not have to pay rent. However, if the court finds that the interference is does not meet the level of actual- partial eviction, Peter can argue that there is a constructive eviction. A constructive eviction is one in which the interference of the LL is so substantial that it is almost as if he, as a tenant, is unable to use actually use the property. In the Rest Realty case, a lease was drafted in which the premises were to be used for businesses purposes, such as meetings and daily paper work. After substantial amounts of flooding over a long period of time, the problem was never fixed. This made the premise area unusable for its business purposes, for the business had to find a different premise all together to hold meetings while the issue persisted. In this case, peter can argue that the LL's breach of allowing construction has interfered substantially with his business purposes. Peter has noticed a decline in the amount of customers, for the construction is noisey and likely deters potential buyers. In addition, the conditions prevent the cooks to make pizza at times, as there is dust flying everywhere, which can make the pizza unsuable. Just like the Rest REalty case, the court found the LL's actions constitued a construcitve over a long period of time, the problem was never fixed. This made the premise area unusable for its business purposes, for the business had to find a different premise all together to hold meetings while the issue persisted. In this case, peter can argue that the LL's breach of allowing construction has interfered substantially with his business purposes. Peter has noticed a decline in the amount of customers, for the construction is noisey and likely deters potential buyers. In addition, the conditions prevent the cooks to make pizza at times, as there is dust flying everywhere, which can make the pizza unsuable. Just like the Rest REalty case, the court found the LL's actions constitued a construcitve eviction, for it met the three elements of such. THe first is that LL's interfrence is substantial- in this matter, Peter can argue that equiment throughout the property, dust flying everywhere, blocking access to the doorways, and having to navigate throughout his shop is just as substantial as the flooding the Rest Realty case. For the LL in both matters effected there overall business. Next, just as the tenant in the Rest Realty case, Peter gave notice to the LL of the issue. Peter constantly informed the LL of the issues at hand, as did the tenants in rest realty. Out of fairness, this is a requirement in order to argue for construction eviction becasue the LL needs to be put on notice of damages or issues, for if they are unaware, it is impossible to fix the problem. Lastly, in order for Peter to argue that there was a LL breach and a constructive eviction, Peter must vacate the premises. This must occur after the LL has failed to perform on his promise of not interfering or fixing the condition and it was not done within a reaosnable amount of time. Therefore, if in advising Peter, it would be to his benefit to tell him to vacate the premises and close shop for accoridng to the ruling in Rest Realty, if those three elements are met, then he can argue for constructive eviction and he would not have to pay rent for the rest of the period. Lastly, if the LL's breach does not create ana acutal- partial evicitoin or constructive eviction, Peter can sue for damages. Damages can be obtained if the LL's breach does not rise to the level of a constructive eviction in which it is as if the tenant is unable to use the premise for its alloted purpose. Just like the Bank case, where the LL allowed construction to occur near the premises, restricting the workers use of access to the bank. The construction in this matter prevented the workers and customers from easy use and access. Here, the contractor buikty scaffolding al acorss the rear of the building, which largely blocked access to the rear door, making people navigate around it. This prevented cutsomers from easy access and made deliveries dificult as well. Due to such it is also imopssible to bring a car close to the area making getting ready for a deliery run extremely hard. Siuch restrictions are very simnilar to the ones in the Bank case, where they were forced to use the rear door due to the amount of equiptment. ALso the timeline in the case and present matter are very similar for the construction lasted longer than expected. However, in both matters business seems to still be able to occur. with this Peter can argue for damages due 7toofthe 9 LL's breach of the CQE, for the construction hinders and makes his work difficult, but not impossible and his expectations are not being met in the matter. Damges would be given possiblity calculated by the difference between a ideal conditions and imopssible to bring a car close to the area making getting ready for a deliery run extremely hard.

Damges would be given possiblity calculated by the difference between a ideal conditions and the bad condition following construction. Linda's Arguments In commercial lease, the LL's duty is to adhere to the covenant of quiet enjoyment and to mitigate damages. Linda can argue that there is not a partial actual eviction because the scaffolding is not permanent and use it not completely prevented for Peter still used the space. Unlike the wall built in the brick wall case where the brick wall prevent him from storing his wagon the property permantly, the scaffolding can be moved, although it may be difficult to move it can be done. Peter is still using the parking spot but it is just a tight squeeze, just an inconvenience not prevention. She can also argue that the there is no constructive eviction if peter did not leave. If Peter maintains on the premises and uses the shop for its specific purpose of creating pizzas and making deliveries, there is no constructive eviction because her acts did not hault use of the shop. The LL, Linda does have an impiled obligation visa vie the covenant of quiet enjoyment to not interfere with the beneficial use of the property. Linda's greatest strength is to point out that Peter has not yet left the the premise. This would invalidate an actual- partial eviction and constructive eviction claim for he was not actually evicted if he is present and it must have not been so substantial if the tenant remained in the premises. If Peter never leaves, then damages may be imposed upon her. However, she has kept in contact with the T the entire time and has made an effort to deduct money from the monthly rent. Unlike the slumlord case, where the LL's actions were fraudlent and extremely neglectful, there should not be any punitive damages awarded for she has kept in contact with the Tenant and has made adjustments to the rent payments. Howver, compensatory damagesa are likley to be given out fo annoyance to Peter, for it has made his business extfemely difficult for months. Although the courts seem to be following the modern trend of applying the contractual approach in which the duty to pay rent is mutally dependant with the LL's duty to not interfere with the beneficial use of the property, a minority of states still maintain that these two duties are mutually independant. This from the monthly rent.

This means that regardless of the actions or inactions of the LL that interferes with the tenant's use of the premises, the tenant has to pay the rent. If the court chooses to following the common law then Peter would be liable for rent for the remaining period if he defaults. The LL has the duty to mitigate damages. In Sommer case, there was defaulting tenant and the LL decided to not accept the surrender of the property and attempted to sue the tenant at the end of the lease term for rent due. However, the court found that the LL had the duty to mitigate damages as it is an obligation in the new modern, contract rule of mutally dependant covenatns. If Peter does abandon the premises, the LL can accept the forfeiture as a surrunder. A surrender is when the LL and tenant agree that the lease agreement will not longer prevail and the tenant can leave peacefully and the LL will not hold the tenant liable to pay rent. If this is so, the LL has a duty to mitigate damages meaning that he must TRY to fill the space through actions such as advertisements and tours. This attempt is out of fairness to both parties following the modern, contract trend. If Peter does leave the premises and defaults payment and the LL does not accept this, it is determined to be an abandoment. In an abandonment the LL still has the burden to mitgate damages and attempt to fill the space. However, if it is not filled it is possible that Peter could be liable for damages. It is up to the LL to prove that she attempted to relet the premises. ",1701,2410
da455e55-d2ac-4054-aae9-e62723a9dc6c," Dana's conveyance of Blackacre altered the interests for herself, her daughter, Fiona, and her cousin, Eve. Eve has a fee simple determinable with possibility of reverter. Dana's use of durational language (""so long as"") is evidence that she intended to convey possession of Blackacre to Eve for the determinable duration, but wished to maintain a possibility of reverter. Dana has a possibility of reverter in fee simple absolute. Again, Dana's use of durational language (""so long as"") is evidence that she intended to convey possession of Blackacre to Eve, but wished to maintain a possibility of reverter in fee simple absolute so that the title would immediately be returned to her should Eve ever attempt to sell the house. From this conveyance, Fiona has nothing. If Eve wished to argue that she should be permitted to attempt to sell Blackacre, she could argue that, because the conveyance does not specifically state what should happen to the house if Eve were to attempt to sell it, it is an ambiguous conveyance. In accordance with the case of the woman who, upon her death, conveyed her home to her sister-in-law to live in but not to sell, when a conveyance is ambiguous, it is appropriate for the courts to determine that it is in fee simple absolute. Dana did not include more specific language that would amount to evidence of the contrary, so it could be assumed that she intended for Eve's interest to be fee simple absolute. Therefore, it would be Eve's to do as she wishes with it, including attempt to sell it. This argument would probably not be particularly persuasive, however, because I believe that the court would find it difficult to ignore Dana's intention of the conveyance. Even if the exact wording could be interpreted as an ambiguous conveyance, it is clear that she did not want the house to be sold, and that if Eve should attempt to sell the house in the future, she wished for ownership of the property to be restored to her or her estate. Another argument that Eve could make as to why she should be permitted to solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre concerns economic waste. She could argue that the property has significantly appreciated in value, and is worth much more than any value she or Fiona could ever get from it. She could argue that the house is already several decades old, has not been inhabited for 5 years, and will require a significant investment just to restore. She could argue that it would be economic waste to not allow a developer to purchase the property in such a prime location. Eve could even try to introduce the best- interest test from Baker v. Wheedon and argue that, because the property is so valuable, it is clearly in both her and Fiona's best interests to sell the property. She could remind the court that that Fiona left of Blackacre concerns economic waste. She could argue that the property has significantly appreciated in value, and is worth much more than any value she or Fiona could ever get from it. She could argue that the house is already several decades old, has not been inhabited for 5 years, and will require a significant investment just to restore. She could argue that it would be economic waste to not allow a developer to purchase the property in such a prime location. Eve could even try to introduce the best- interest test from Baker v. Wheedon and argue that, because the property is so valuable, it is clearly in both her and Fiona's best interests to sell the property. She could remind the court that that Fiona left New Suffolk 16 years prior, currently lives in New York City where she has a successful career, and that she specfically told her mother that she had no interest in returning to New Suffolk or Blackacre. Certainly she is grieving the death of her mother, but at the end of the day, she doesn't truly want to return to Blackacre, and the profits from the sale would be of much greater benefit to her. Again, I don't think these arguments would be particularly persuasive because I think the court would be more inclined to listen to what Fiona believes is in her own best interest as opposed to what Eve thinks is in her best interest. If Fiona explained the sentimental value of the property, I believe that the court would be very inclined to rule in her favor, even if they believed that not selling the property was economic waste. One argument Fiona could make to support reclaiming ownership of Blackacre is that the language Dana used in the conveyance, ""provided that and so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house,"" clearly expresses a duration, and so Eve's interest is a fee simple determinable with the possibility of reverter. FSD with POR requires that, upon the end of the 'duration' (when Eve attempts to sell the house) ownership of the property is immediately restored to the grantor or their estate, regardless if they have taken action yet. Because Fiona inherited all of her mother's personal property according to Dana's will, it is reasonable to assume that she now represents Dana's estate. So Fiona could argue that once Eve received the phone call and became interested in receiving bids on the property, she was 'attempting' to sell the house, and ownership of the property was immediately restored to Dana's estate, i.e. Fiona. I think this argument is good, albeit a bit far-fetched. What I think is an even better argument, however, if for Fiona to ask the courts to simply look at what her mother's intention was for the conveyance. If Eve is even considering selling the property, it is clear from the conveyance that Dana wished for the property to be immediately returned to her/her issue. I think this is a very strong and reasonable argument that a court would be very inclined to support. Another argument Fiona could make as for why Eve is responsible for the costs of the repairs to the home, and potentially even strengthen her argument for why she should be permitted to reclaim ownership of Blackacre, is because Eve has committed permissive waste by leaving the house neglected for 5 years after she moved to Florida. If Eve had not been negligent in keeping up the home, it would wished for the property to be immediately returned to her/her issue. I think this is a very strong and reasonable argument that a court would be very inclined to support. Another argument Fiona could make as for why Eve is responsible for the costs of the repairs to the home, and potentially even strengthen her argument for why she should be permitted to reclaim ownership of Blackacre, is because Eve has committed permissive waste by leaving the house neglected for 5 years after she moved to Florida. If Eve had not been negligent in keeping up the home, it would not be in need of so many repairs. By moving out of state and leaving the house to weather the elements, Eve's actions amount to permissive waste and she is responsible for covering the damages, and potentially even losing ownership of the property. I think this is a very strong argument because, although Eve had her reasons for leaving the home, she allowed it to become significantly damaged and allowed the valuable property to be in waste. Fiona could also argue that Eve is responsible for the costs of repairs to the home because she intends to make Blackacre her residence, and if Eve still owns the home, Eve would be the landlord and she the tenant. As established in the St. Peter case, every lease for a residential dwelling includes an implied warranty of habitability that cannot be waived. It is the duty of a landlord to deliver over and maintain an environment that meets the standard for human habitation. Therefore, as the landlord, it would be Eve's responsibility to fix these substantial damages to the home. I believe that this argument could be persuasive because it is Eve's fault that the house is not in a habitable condition, and it is her responsibility to fix it if she wishes to maintain ownership. "," The claim that Peter would need to prove is that the substantial intereference of the ongoing repairs, initiated by Linda, amounted to constructive eviction. If we cannot prove that the interference amounted to constructive eviction, we could prove that Linda breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which is a lower threshold than constructive eviction. To prove constructive eviction, first Peter would need to prove that Linda caused the interference. Although Linda would claim that she couldn't have forseen the repairs taking so long or causing such an interference for Peter therefore she isn't the cause, she is the cause because she is the owner of the building and she is the one who hired the contractor to undertake the repairs. Second, Peter would need to prove that the interference is substantial. The noise and dust that accompany intensive construction would clearly be a substantial interference with a restaurant, and they To prove constructive eviction, first Peter would need to prove that Linda caused the interference. Although Linda would claim that she couldn't have forseen the repairs taking so long or causing such an interference for Peter therefore she isn't the cause, she is the cause because she is the owner of the building and she is the one who hired the contractor to undertake the repairs. Second, Peter would need to prove that the interference is substantial. The noise and dust that accompany intensive construction would clearly be a substantial interference with a restaurant, and they are losing customers because of it. Additionally, Peter claims that the shop is having difficulty making deliveries on time because of very limited access to the cars from the door due to the extensive scaffolding that has been constructed. Peter notices decreased revenue. This clearly establishes a substantial interference due to the repairs. Then, Peter would need to prove that Linda is aware of the interference upon Peter. She is clearly aware that the ongoing repairs are significantly interfering with Peter's business because he has repeatedly expressed his concerns to her, and she has responded sympathetically, even deducting from his rent fees for the hassle. She is clearly aware. To this, Linda would claim that she was not aware of the exact degree of the interference (i.e. causing Peter to lose customers, revenue, etc.) but even if this is true, she knows that it is a causing a substantial interference for him nonetheless. Finally, Peter would have to abandon the premises within a reasonable amount of time. He has not abandoned the premises yet out of fear of breaking his five-year lease, which I believe to be a very reasonable explanation. Linda would argue that he has remained a tenant beyond what is a reasonable amount of time so he was not constructively evicted, but we know from Reste Realty v. Cooper that the standard for what is 'reasonable' vary significantly based on the circumstances. What I believe to be Peter's strongest claim to support constructive eviction is the claim that the constrution equiptment encroaches on his designated parking spot. Although the construction equipment encroaches upon accessability to the back door and the parking lot for deliveries, these were not guarenteed in Peter's lease. All that was guarenteed was ""common right of access thereto,"" not specifically access to the back door. Simply cutting off access to the convenience of the back door would not amount to constructive eviction, as established in the Consulting v. North Conway Bank case, because these specifics were not established in the lease. However, in the lease Peter was guarenteed a designated parking spot. And, as established in Smith v. McEnany, for a landlord to encroach even partially upon the leased property amounts to constructive eviction of the entire leased property. Peter could argue that he is constructively evicted from full use of his designated parking spot, which is his leased property, and therefore he is not responsible for paying rent to Linda. specifically access to the back door. Simply cutting off access to the convenience of the back door would not amount to constructive eviction, as established in the Consulting v. North Conway Bank case, because these specifics were not established in the lease. However, in the lease Peter was guarenteed a designated parking spot. And, as established in Smith v. McEnany, for a landlord to encroach even partially upon the leased property amounts to constructive eviction of the entire leased property. Peter could argue that he is constructively evicted from full use of his designated parking spot, which is his leased property, and therefore he is not responsible for paying rent to Linda. If Peter does not abandon the property, or if other elements required for constructive eviction cannot be proven, we can still establish that Linda breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment. As established in the Consulting v. North Conway Bank case, even if the court determines that a tenant has not been actually or constructively evicted, they can still find that the landlord has substantially interfered with their use and enjoyment of the leased property.

5f24737f-7e15-41a4-ab47-b5046873731c," in the case of Dana's conveyance, there are a few issues that come up with the way dana conveyed her estate. First it is important to note, that Dana owned blackacre in fee simple absolute, the champion of all estates, when she first recieved blackacre from her parents that passed away in 1980. Dana later decided to convey blackacre by a poorly writtren conveyance that could be interpreted in a few different ways. A court is likely to find that Eve's interest in the land is either a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, which would meant that Dana, or whoever is administrating her estate a right of entry/ power of termination in fee simple absolute. In this case, it would mean that Fiona, dana's daughter, who is in the dana's will to inherit all of dana's personal property will have to excercise the right to re-enter in order to have blackacre. The reason a court could hold that Eve's interest is in FSSCS is because of the language in the conveyance that seems like conditional language ""provided that"". However, a court could also find that Eve's interest is a fee simple determinable as the language ""so long as"" is used in the conveyance as well, which is language of limitation. If the court holds that the eve's interest is FSD then when the limitation occurs, then the property automatically reverts to dana's estate, or fiona, as fiona would now have a future interest in possibility of revertor. The language in this conveyance also mentions that the house is not to be sold. This is similar to the language used in the conveyance of white v. brown, where the grantor also wrote that the house is not to be sold. In that case, the court ruled that the conveyance was a fee simple absolute, as it was not clear enough that the grantor wanted the house to be a life estate. The rules of construction also look at the intent of the grantor, but must be balanced with one another. The rule of construction favor a fee simple absolute, as it is the champion of all estates, and has free alienability and is devisable. However, unlike in white v. brown, the lanauge here seems more clear that there is some limitation or condition. Therefore the court will likely not hold that eve's interest is a fee simple determinable. Another rule of construction favors a fee simple subject to condition subsequent rather than a fee simple determinable. This is because the court favors productivity of the land, and does not want the land to just revert back to an owner automatically, if he or she does not make good use of the land. Unlike, the ruling in mahrenholz v. board of trustees, where the court found that the language was a fee simple determinable, that case was unique a court will likely find that Dana had a fee and an exception to the rules of construction. Therefore simple absolute before she made the conveyance, then when the convyeance was made, eve would own blackacre in fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and fiona would have a future interest in right fee simple subject to condition subsequent rather than a fee simple determinable. This is because the court favors productivity of the land, and does not want the land to just revert back to an owner automatically, if he or she does not make good use of the land. Unlike, the ruling in mahrenholz v. board of trustees, where the court found that the language was a fee simple determinable, that case was unique and an exception to the rules of construction. Therefore a court will likely find that Dana had a fee simple absolute before she made the conveyance, then when the convyeance was made, eve would own blackacre in fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and fiona would have a future interest in right of entry/power of termination in fee simple absolute. Since the estate eve has is not in fee simple asbolute, it must be in the same or similar condition that it was given to her, meaning not creating waste. Under the old common law, waste is any change to the property, positive or negative. Under the modern rule, like in woodrick v. wood, the court found that ameliorative waste is not considered waste. however, in this case, eve did not increase the value of the property, rather she neglected the property when she left it and the house was in a bad state. Blackacre had the roof shingles missing the glass is cracked and there were other serious problems. This negligence by eve to take care of the property could be permissive waste which is waste caused by negligence of the property. Fiona could argue, the waste could also be affirmative as she voluntarily left the property and the value decreased. Fiona, could also argue that the waste was economic waste, as eve did not put the property to best economic use by leaving the property and not even leasing the property to anybody when she went to live in florida. Eve could make an argument that not selling the land constitutes economic waste, as the property appreciated in value. however, fiona can mention that economic waste is not the sole factor in determining whether to sell land, and she should agree, as a future interest holder to sell the land. If she does not agree a court of equity will only sell this land if it is necessary, and is in the bet interest of all parties. If it is found that the tenant created waste, then fiona could sue for damages or maybe even have a case to take back the estate. Fiona would be able to hold eve responsible for the repairs in this case. Eve could argue that damage to the windows and the condition of blackacre is not bad enough to constitute waste, and therefore she is not liable for the repairs. Regarding the sale of the land, in the very conveyance there is a condition stating that eve ""does not attempt to sell the house"". This condition would be broken if eve is trying to sell the house, and in this case, Eve clearly attmepted to sell the house as the real estate developer contacted her telling ehr that he received her contact information from the New Suffolk Real Estate Office. Once the condition occurs in this case, the future interest, Fiona, has a right of entry of power of termination. With this type of future interet however, fiona must excercise her right to enter the propery and it is not reverted back to her Regarding the sale of the land, in the very conveyance there is a condition stating that eve ""does not attempt to sell the house"". This condition would be broken if eve is trying to sell the house, and in this case, Eve clearly attmepted to sell the house as the real estate developer contacted her telling ehr that he received her contact information from the New Suffolk Real Estate Office. Once the condition occurs in this case, the future interest, Fiona, has a right of entry of power of termination. With this type of future interet however, fiona must excercise her right to enter the propery and it is not reverted back to her automatically like it would if eve had a fee simple absolute. Eve could argue, that she had not sold the land yet which means the condition is not broken, and therefore the land is hers at the time. If she does not excercise this right it could leave to AP case. This is important because of the adverse possession problem that could occur if it is found that fiona did not excercise her right of entry and therefore eve would try to adversly posess the land. however, because eve did not use the property continuously, like a true owner and she left the property she would have a hard time with the adverse posession case. Even if it is found that eve broke the condition, meaning she no longer owned blacacre, she would have a hard time with an adverse possession case as she did not meet the stautue of limitation as she only lived on blackacre continuously from 2010-2014 not meeting the 10 year statute of limitation. The policy rational for adverse possession is that society wants to make the best use of the land and wants to give the land to whoever is making best use of it like the earning theory, and if the true owner is sleeping on his rights, the sleeping theory is that you snooze you lose. "," In this case, Peter has a few legal rights he should be aware of. First, it is important to note that this is a commerical space that peter has rented, as he is renting the space for a pizza shop and he does not live there, which would first eliminate that he cannot use the implied warranty of habitiability. In this case however, peter can use the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which is used for both residential and commercial settings, and is there to ensure that the tenant can enjoy their use of the land without intereference from the landlord or the landlord's agents. Peter should also realize that his tenancy is a tenancy of years, as it is for a fixed amount of time (5 years), and that if he breaches the lease, or the landlord does not breach the lease he is liable for rent for the whole term of the lease. However, peter does have a good case here that the landlord breached his covenant of quiet enjoyment, if he leaves the premises, or at least that he should be able to collect damages. First, I must advise peter that he does not have a solid claim for actual eviction as he was not actually locked out of the premises. However, Peter should know that he has a good case of partial actual intereference from the landlord or the landlord's agents. Peter should also realize that his tenancy is a tenancy of years, as it is for a fixed amount of time (5 years), and that if he breaches the lease, or the landlord does not breach the lease he is liable for rent for the whole term of the lease. However, peter does have a good case here that the landlord breached his covenant of quiet enjoyment, if he leaves the premises, or at least that he should be able to collect damages. First, I must advise peter that he does not have a solid claim for actual eviction as he was not actually locked out of the premises. However, Peter should know that he has a good case of partial actual eviction, because of the parking space situation. Just like the court held in Smith v. Mcnany, that partial eviction from the premises, even as small as 15 inches, is an eviction from the whole premise, as the tenant when leasing the land is entitied to use of the whole property without interference from the landlord in any kind, not even intereference that is not materially substantial. In this case, the equipment from construction and repairs, that Linda the landlord is in charge of, encroaches on Peter's leased premises as it enroaches on his designated parking spot. A court will likely rule that this would constitute partial eviction which means eviction from the whole premises and peter could collect damages for this breach. This would also mean that peter would not be liable to pay rent for the rest of the term, and therefore he can leave before the five years of his lease is up. Secondly, peter could attempt to claim that he was constructively evicted from the property, ONLY if he leaves the premises and stops running his pizza shop. In order for peter to claim constructive eviction in this case, there are a few things that he must establish like the interference must be substantial by the landlord, and peter must have given the landlord a reasonable notice within a reasonable time to fix the issue, and he must leave the premises. One thing he must establish is the interference is from the landlords actions, which he would could prove because the construction is because linda the landlord is the one that hired the contractor to work on the building. Peter must prove that this interference is substantial enough to constitute constructive eviction. In this case, the construction is not permenant, but it is reoccuring as it is taking a lot longer than a week and is there for a substantial amount of time and is effecting Peter's business. Peter can use the facts that is is noisy, the dust, and the scaffolding that blocks access to the rear door all to show that the interference is substantial. Like the case of Reste v. Realty, the court ruled that in order for the interference to be substantial it does not have to be permenant. However, unlike in Reste, peter has not left the premises which means that his constructive eviction claim would be thrown out. Linda, although a weaker argument, could argue that intereference was not so substantial, as Peter was still able to operate his business and did not HAVE to shut down. Peter must also show that he gave the landlord reasonable time and reasonable notice of the situation to give the landlord a chance to fix the issue. In this case peter calls the landlord linda and expresses his concerns, and although Linda can claim that she was sympathetic and deducts a small amount of money v. Realty, the court ruled that in order for the interference to be substantial it does not have to be permenant. However, unlike in Reste, peter has not left the premises which means that his constructive eviction claim would be thrown out. Linda, although a weaker argument, could argue that intereference was not so substantial, as Peter was still able to operate his business and did not HAVE to shut down. Peter must also show that he gave the landlord reasonable time and reasonable notice of the situation to give the landlord a chance to fix the issue. In this case peter calls the landlord linda and expresses his concerns, and although Linda can claim that she was sympathetic and deducts a small amount of money from his rent, Linda then disappears and stops answering his phone calls. Peter continued to call every week to then months and still hears nothing from Linda. This constitutes more than a reasonable notice as he waived and waited for Linda to do something amount the issue and she did not. Like in Reste, the plaintiff continued to wait and contact the landlord after the building manager had died, and the court ruled that this was reasonable notice, just like the court would likely rule here. The weakness however in this argument, is that peter does not know why linda is not answering her phone call, and linda may have some argument to why she was unable to answer, or she could argue that in this lease, since peter has leased the premises for so long, he could have waited a little longer for her to reach back out and a few months is not enough time. However, this argument of Linda's is a weaker argument. However, even if peter does not abandon the premises, and therefore cannot claim that he was constructively evicted, peter could still sue for damages. Peters use of the premises also includes a common area that is not for his exclusive use. This is similar to Echo, where the common area used was found not to be exclusive. The court in Echo found that even with this common area, and the fact that the plaintiff in Echo did not leave the premises, the interference was substantial enough to collect damages. Peter could then argue that as well, should collect damages, as his business has suffered from what has happened. The policy rational in echo, is that there is no reason to wait for the interference to be so substantial that peter must leave. Peter could also possibly collect punitive damages if he tries, if he can prove that the lanlord maliciously stopped answering his phone calls and let his business fail. The collect allows punitive damages when the landlord acts maliciously and they want to send a message that that type of behavior is wrong. However, Peter could also collect compensatory damages as there was actually harm to his pizza business as his revenues are lower, there are less customers, and overall peter is suffering from what is going on with the construction in the building. If peter decides to leave the premises, he would have a good case for constructive eviction, and he should know, that if he leaves, even if the could stop paying rent as the landlord breached. Peter landlord is not found to have breached, the landlord still has a duty to mitigate damages and try to make a reasonable effort to release the premises. There is no standard formula to how to see that the landlord that that type of behavior is wrong.

Peter should know, that if he leaves, even if the landlord is not found to have breached, the landlord still has a duty to mitigate damages and try to make a reasonable effort to release the premises. There is no standard formula to how to see that the landlord has done this, but this could be through ads, or craiglist, or anything else the landlord can show. interestingly, the burden of proof falls on the landlord, even if the landlord is found to not be the breachinf party. This comes from the modern rule in Sommer v. Kriddel, where the landlord had the duty to show that he mitigated damages even if the tenant abandoned this premises. In this case, if Peter leaves the premises and the landlord does not mitigate damages the tenant is not liable to pay the rest of the rent, which is exactly what happened in sommer v. kriddel. Peter should also know, that if he stops paying rent and remains on the premises, Linda must go through the judicial system in order to evict him from the premises even if he is the one that breached. The old common law finds that if the tenant breached the landlord can resort to self help if the means he or she does so is peaceful. This however, is not the modern rule that is followed in Berg v. Wiley which establishes that the landlord must resort to the judicial system in order to evict a tenant. The policy rational behind this is that self help can lead to violence and distruption in society, and society does not want people to take the situation to their own hands. ",1451,1783
8d5c28dd-7532-4b93-b654-7c254bd47fce," Conveyances The conveyance made by Dana is ambigous due to the fact it includes the language of both a fee simple determinable (FSD) and a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS). Since the language in the conveyance is both conditional (FSSCS) and durational (FSD), the courts would have to look to the rules of consturction which state that they favor an FSSCS over and FSD. This would give Eve a FSSCS and Dana therefore would have a right of entry/power of termination. It is also important to note that in the off chance New Suffolk uses Illinois law as basis for their ruling, Eve would have a FSD and Dana would have a possibility of reverter. Sale/Solicitation of Offers Eve's effort to solicit other offers in an effort to sell Blackacre may face an uphill battle. Conveyances are meant to favor the intent of the grantor, as seen in White v. Brown and waste is not the only factor courts look at in determing the sale of property, as seen in the highway case with the grandchildren (Baker v. Weedon?). In the present case, Eve can argue that Dana's right of entry terminated upon her death and therefore she now owns the property in fee simple (FSA). She can also argue that it would be economic waste to leave the property in the state of disrepair instead of taking the ""staggering amount"" that was offered for the property. In addition, Eve can argue that she could get even more money than was offered to her if she solicits further offers on the property. In contrast, Eve looking to sell the property faces, as stated, an uphill battle. Since conveyances are meant to favor the intent of the grantor, looking at the conveyance can clearly show that the grantor made clear ""the house is not to be sold"". Eve's argument for owning the property in FSA will aslo be null due to the essay instructions which provide that if a conveyance does not make clear who to distribute the interest to, it shall first pass to isse. In this case, Fiona could argue that the right of entry therefore passed to her upon Dana's death. It can also be argued that since Fiona wants to now live on the property, the court must look at the sentimental and emotional attachment that Fiona has to the property, considering she grew up there, and not just 6 economic waste/value of the property, as held the by the highway grandchildren case. null due to the essay instructions which provide that if a conveyance does not make clear who to distribute the interest to, it shall first pass to isse. In this case, Fiona could argue that the right of entry therefore passed to her upon Dana's death. It can also be argued that since Fiona wants to now live on the property, the court must look at the sentimental and emotional attachment that Fiona has to the property, considering she grew up there, and not just the economic waste/value of the property, as held by the highway grandchildren case. Policy would dictate fairness for Fiona due to her sentimental value and would also dictate that a conveyance that is ambigous should maintain the interest of the grantor. Reclaiming/Repairs Fiona has a strong argument for reclaiming the property but likely will have a difficult time getting damages to repair the property from Eve. As previosuly stated, the highway case with the grandchildren state that sentimental and emotional interest in a property shall be looked at and not just the economic value of the property. In addition, instructions provided state that if a will does not convey interest, it shall pass first to the issue of the deceased. In this case, since the will does not provide an executor, nor does the hypo, Fiona would therefore obtain the right of entry. The hypo also states that Fiona, when returning to Blackacre, felt sentimental and wanted to move back in to Blackacre. Not only would this favor her in an argument against a sale, the mere fact she would have a right of entry would allow her to take ownership of the property if Eve attempts to sell. In contrast, Eve could argue that the rules of construciton want to favor an FSA where possible. Eve can argue that since Fiona is not listed as an executor, upon Dana's death, the interest she now has is an FSA and has the ability to do as she wishes with the property. Eve would also argue that in addition to this, you do not look to the intent of the party and instead look to the language. Unfortunately for Eve, this would probably backfire as the language, as previously stated, states clearly that ""the house is not to be sold"". Lastly, Fiona will be required to use the theory of waste in order to obtain repair money from Eve. There are four types of waste; affirmative, permissive, economic, and ameolorative waste. Fiona can argue that since she is a future interest holder (under the idea she gained the right of entry upon Dana's death), Eve is reuquired under the theory of waste to return the property in the condition she received it in. More specifically, Fiona will have to argue that Eve committed permissive waste by not upkeeping the property and making reasonable repairs. In this 6 Fiona notices that roof shingles are missing, case, the glass is cracked, and other serious problems exist. Fiona will argue that these are clearly things that a homeowner would regularly upkeep and therefore consittue permissive waste. There are four types of waste; affirmative, permissive, economic, and ameolorative waste.

In this case, Fiona notices that roof shingles are missing, the glass is cracked, and other serious problems exist. Fiona will argue that these are clearly things that a homeowner would regularly upkeep and therefore consittue permissive waste. Policy would dictate essentially the same thing as previously said. It would only be fair to allow Fiona to reenter the property and for it not to be sold due to her sentimental attachment to the property. Policy would also likely favor the idea of getting repair damages from Eve under the theory of permissive waste. This would provide certainty to future interest holders that their interest in the property will not be destoryed by a present interest holder. "," Considering Peter is in a term of years lease, and therefore would remain responsible for the remainder of his term if he leaves, he would have to make a valid claim for actual or constructive eviction under a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE). CQE can result in actual eviction, constructive eviction, or damages. Peter could not claim a breach of the implied warranty of habilitability considering that would only apply to residential leases and his lease is commercial. Constructive eviction under CQE in particular requires that the landlord interferred with the tenant's use of the premises, the intereference was substantial, the tenant gave reasonable notice and time to fix the issue, and the tenant left within a reasonable time upon the issue not being resolved. In the present case, Peter can argue that, under the Reste Realty case, the intereference was so substantial and deprived him of his beneficial use of the premises considering how noisy it was, he had to keep his windows closed, he was losing business, and he was inconvenienced by the scaffolding placed in front of the back door (which was most commonly used by the pizza shop). Peter can also argue that, unlike the Echo Consulting case that held the intereference of constuction was temporary, the consturciton here seems to be never ending. Since Linda stated it should only take ""a week or so"" and months have passed since then, clearly there is no end in sight. In addition to the above, Peter can argue that under the brick wall case, the minor encroachment of the construction equiptment on his designated parking space evicts him from the entire parking space. Since the construction crew is there under the direction of the landlord, it is clear that this is the landlord's fault. This also clearly breaches the lease agreement which provides Peter with ""one designated parking Linda stated it should only take ""a week or so"" and months have passed since then, clearly there is no end in sight. In addition to the above, Peter can argue that under the brick wall case, the minor encroachment of the construction equiptment on his designated parking space evicts him from the entire parking space. Since the construction crew is there under the direction of the landlord, it is clear that this is the landlord's fault. This also clearly breaches the lease agreement which provides Peter with ""one designated parking spot"" and not just 9/ a designated parking spot. As the brick wall case held, a landlord's intrusion on part of the premises is an eviction of the entire premises. The Brick Wall case also touches on rent abatement, which is something Peter could attempt to bring due to losing a fraction of his lease agreement. Policy in favor of Peter's argument would be that the landlord is in a better position to deal with these issues and is required to uphold the beneficial use of the premises, which under Peter's argument, Linda has not done. In contrast to Peter's arguments above, Linda can argue that Peter was neither actually or construtively evicted. Under the Echo Consulting case, the construction that was being done by the bank who owned the building was deemed to be temporary and therefore not a substantial enough intereference to constitute constructive eviction. In the present case, Linda can argue that, like the Echo case, the construction did not substantially interferre with Peter's use of the premises. The lease agreement clearly stated that Peter does not have a right to the back door specifically and he still has common use of the parking lot and one designated space. Linda can also counter Peter's argument about the length of the construction and claim that the ""... or so"" statement clearly states that a week was an approximation and construction tends to take much longer. Most impotantly, Linda can argue that Peter has not left the premises within a reasonable time as required and therefore the conditions must not be ""so substantial"" as to constitute a constructive eviction. She can use the Reste Realty case against his argument stating that the flooding conditions severly interrupted the tenant's beneficial use of the premises and was also ruled a continous issue, unlike the consturciton described in Echo which was ruled to be only temporary and of minor inconvenience. In addition, in order to circumvent Peter's claim for actual eviction due to the parking space being minorly encroached upon, Linda can either state that he is still fitting within his parking space or simply offer him a temporary assigned space that is not being enroached upon, since the lease agreement states ""one assigned parking spot"" and not that particular spot. Linda also can claim that in an effort to mitigate damages for Peter, and in an effort of good 6 she allowed him to pay $100 less per month will, for rent. Policy in favor of Linda would dictate that she has made a clear effort to work around the invoncenience and has been fair in doing so. In addition, in order to circumvent Peter's claim for actual eviction due to the parking space being minorly encroached upon, Linda can either state that he is still fitting within his parking space or simply fer him a temporary assigned space that is not being enroached upon, since the lease agreement states ""one assigned parking spot"" and not that particular spot. Linda also can claim that in an effort to mitigate damages for Peter, and in an effort of good will, she allowed him to pay $100 less per month for rent. Policy in favor of Linda would dictate that she has made a clear effort to work around the invoncenience and has been fair in doing so. Considering the factors and relevant case law, Peter's best argument would be to argue damages from Linda. Using the Echo Consulting case he can claim that the construction, while lasting longer than expected, is not permenant but did interefere with his beneficial use of the property. His main argument could be showing a substantial decrease in profits causing him undue burden. Echo Consulting held that damages were allowed in cases where the interference did not meet the burden of constructive eviction in order to promote fairness and hold landlord's liable for their instrusions. Linda would be hard pressed to argue against damages as she herself was sympathetic towards Peter and seemingly admits that the repairs are taking longer than expected constituting an intrusion on her behalf.

b7f40167-7274-4643-a030-af37834acebd," question #1: what kinds of interests were created by Dana's conveyance and why? Dana's (D's) conveyance creates either a FSSCS (fee simple subject to condition subsequent), in Eve with D having the option to exercise her right of re-entry of power of termination in FSA. however, the conveyance also uses language of duration evidenced by the ""so long as"" which would suggest a Fee simple determinable (FSD) in Eve with D having an automatic Possibility of Reverter in FSA. next, the words ""the house is not to be sold"" would suggest a FSA. given the variety of future interests that may be interpreted, a court would need to look at the conveyance carefully and apply the rules of construction necessary when an ambiguous conveyance is created, as seen here. similar to MarenHolz v. School Board, where the deed had language of both a FSSCS and FSD, a court woudl need to loo look to the rules of construction. because of the use of the word only, the court interpreted this to be a stronger indication of an FSD, specifically of POR. the rule that the court applied in marhrenholz can similarly be applied here because the same use of the word ""only"" in D's conveyance to Eve suggests that D would automatically re-taek Blackacre under POR if Eve (E) even attempte to sell the house. on the other hand, the rules of construction say that with amiguous conveyances is it important to favor FSSCS over FSD to limit the risk of property automatically reverting back. but with the specific use of the word only, and with the intentions of D in midn that she wants to keep Blackacre in the family, the court may go against the typical rule and instead favor FSD. this also woudl avoid the potential AP issues brougth about by FSSCS. under White v. Brown, the conveyance coudl also be interpredted to be in FSA. following the rule of construction favoring the free alienability of property and theother rule that favors FSA given the alienability that comes with that particular estate, part of the court woudl look to the landuage of ""not to be sold to interpret this as a FSA. the particular side of the court who had this reasoning woudl also look to D's intentions. because D wants to keep blackacre in her family, FSA woudl best achieve that goal. under White v. Brown, the conveyance coudl also be interpredted to be in FSA. following the rule of construction favoring the free alienability of property and theother rule that favors FSA given the alienability that comes with that particular estate, part of the court woudl look to the landuage of ""not to be sold to interpret this as a FSA. the particular side of the court who had this reasoning woudl also look to D's intentions. because D wants to keep blackacre in her family, FSA woudl best achieve that goal. as for the will D wrote to her daughter Fiona (F), D dies testate and conveys her property to her issue (F). because E was given plackacre and now F has a present interest they are tenants in common. also, because nothign indicates that Eve has a life estate, when D dies her interest doesnt go from future to present. * are there any arguments that Eve could bmake that she should be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of blackacre? yes, because the conveyance only lists the house as not to be sold the issue before E is whether as someone with a present interest in Blackacre she can solicit offers for the sale of blackacre, or if her doing so is a violation of the condition expressed in the conveyance and may open up Fiona to exercise an executory interest (depdngi on how conveyance is read) or at the very least as a tenant in common and prevent her from doing so. a speific look at the langguage shows that Eve gets blackacre sonly so long as she doe snto attempt to sell the HOUSE. nowhere in the conveyance doe sit say that Eve cannot sel other parts of the land. while F might have a valid point in highlighting the interests of her mother whcih is that she wants Blackacre to stay in the family, Eve coudl ultimately argue that hse is not violating the condition by trying to sell the rest of the land on blackacre, which would be considered fungible property since Eve's and D's attachment ot the land was to the house. specifically, for E, because t eemories are so strong for her when she remembers Dana. Eve could even show that because Riona feels sentimental bout blackacre, selling the surrounding land would not interfere with her maintining the property she is attched to. as seen in Arkland, the court did not just apply an economic test, rather it held that an economic test when looking at whether property should be sold was not the only test and valued a test weighing the personal attachent to the property. if E would be able to sell the surroundign land but not the house, she would still satisfy the test of personal attachment to the property and still keep the house in the family and still respect the intentions of D. partition by sale.

(or PIK) in order fro E to do this however, she would need to partition the land with F, who is a tenant in common. E owuld not be able to sell either part or all of blackacre without F's permission because tennants in common have interests in the whole and their interests are undivided. with this said, E could partition Blackacre by sale, keeping the land with the hosue and selling off the remainder of the land to the realestate companies. however, unlike Arkland, wehre it was known that the plot of land was approximatle 100 acres, it is no tknown how many acres blackacre is. it would be hlepful to know fi the property was large enough that E could partition by sale and keep the house on the remaining acreage. if however, blackacre is small and only is enough space for the house, this woudl lead to a compelling argument for Fiona. waste - she did not commit permissive waste-- she paid property taxes on it even when she was gone eve woud need to support her argument largely based on the doctrine of waste. as for economic waste, while E did chooe to leave the house ad go to FL, she puts the realestate taxes on auto-pay so they are paid annually. because E does this, she does not contirbute to the decrease in value of blackacre. eve could also agur that did she not comit perissive waste by still paying property taxes on Blackacre. she also locked the house to prevent it from potentially being vandalized or becoming delapidated from the cold new suffolk weather. weather whcih coudl have happened if windows were left open, doors blew open etc. also, she could argue, similarly to Anan Weedon the elderly widow, who was so old she was unable to care for the property and was financially struggling, that becuase she (E) was so emotionally upset after D's sudden passing, she was not in the proper state to take care of the property. fungible vs personall property fiona's arguments: does F have any basis for reclaiming ownership of blackacre and/or forhlding eve accoutnable or hte repairs needed on blackacre. discuss strenghts and weakenssses intent of her mother Dana: fungible vs personall property fiona's arguments: does F have any basis for reclaiming ownership of blackacre and/or forhlding eve accoutnable or hte repairs needed on blackacre. discuss strenghts and weakenssses intent of her mother Dana: --want to keep Blackacre in her family (rules of construction) the first main arugmetn F could make would be regardin the intent of her mother when writing the conveyance. it is clear thta D wanted to keep the property in the family, and if Eve tried to get any other bids for the proeprty, which would qualify as an attempt to sell the house, this would be a violation of the condition expressly stated in the conveyance and F as the current interest holder could take the remainder of E's interest andown blackacre in FSA. F woudl be able to ultimately argue that because he mother D coneyred ""al personal property"" she now ons blackacre in FSA. a court could interpret this as an executory interest or her having the property in FSA, but the isssue is that the two conveyances whcih under rules of construction shoudl be reach together, give the same land to two people. so the issue is is it interpreted as tenants in common or does F's interest in all D's personal property trump the ocnveyance E has over blackacre. eith erway, F coudl argue that ther mothers intent was to keep it in the family, and that because E might rtry to violate D's wishes, F should be ble to stop her from doing so. the majority of F's argumetn should be focused on the doctirne of waste, becuse she has a number of strong arguments proving affirmative waste, a lack of almeriorative waste, and permissive waste. because E decidedes she cannot live on blackacre anymore and moves to florida, the property has become severely damaged. F coudl argue that similar to Woodrick v. Wood, the porpety has no value now due to E's committing affirmative waste by voluntarily moving to florida and not making any arrangements to up-keep the property such as regular landscaping, snow plowing, and scheuled repairmen to come by to look at the porperty. E did not even contact F to ask if she coudl check on blackacre and the house. also, F coudl argue permissive waste. a stong argument would be that E was negligent in leaving blackacre knowing the weather in New suffolk and letting the house lose roof shingles, have cracked glass windows, and serious other problems. F coudl argue that because E voluntarily left Blackacre and failed to return at any point to repair the house, she should be entitled to to the money to fix the house. lastly, F could argue that there is no almeriottive waste, although not commonly accepted inteh US, F couls till argue that even though teh value of the property is now much higher than it used to be, E had nothign to do with that and therefore should not be able to aruge almeriorative waste. lastly, under the reasoning of Woodrick v. Wood, F may be able to get money negligent in leaving blackacre knowing the weather in New suffolk and letting the house lose roof shingles, have cracked glass windows, and serious other problems. F coudl argue that because E voluntarily left Blackacre and failed to return at any point to repair the house, she should be entitled to to the money to fix the house. lastly, F could argue that there is no almeriottive waste, although not commonly accepted inteh US, F couls till argue that even though teh value of the property is now much higher than it used to be, E had nothign to do with that and therefore should not be able to aruge almeriorative waste. lastly, under the reasoning of Woodrick v. Wood, F may be able to get money equivalent to the vlaue of hat was lost. while the court in woodrick only had the woman who had an attachment be compensated for the value of the house, F coudl use her personal attchetn and desire to now live there to argue she needs to be compensated fo rthe value of the house prior to the damgae. even under landlord-tenant law, alhtough a weaker arugment since the ocnveyances list both E and F, if F plans to live there the house would potentially be a violation of IWH, and if E failed ot make the repairs given the modern approach to land lord tenant as a contract betweent the two, she coudl sue for damages.

Mcenany case where the court ruled that even a partial eviction qualifies as an actual eviction, that because the scaffolding largely blocks afcces ot teh raer door, that is a partial eviction. while L could arge that P and his staff and cusomers whould in theory vagiaate the maze of scaffolding and therfore were not physically blocked form entering the property, i think P could counter and say that the scaffolign now physically prevents him adn his staff from using partf of the entrace now phyciaclly covered by it and also that they are no longer to use the entrnace in the same physical way that they used to. this would be a weaker argument. however, th tfact tht its nerly impossibel to bring a car cloe to the rear door, woudl be stronger to show partial eviction. udner smith v. mecenany, the tenant is paying rent to have all of the promised space, if P can no longer bring a car close to the rear door, and becuse a car woudl get to the rear door via th eparking lot which was promised to P by L in the lease as a space used in common, it woudl be a partial eviction constitution an actual eviction udner the SMITH reasoning. also, the consturction equipment enroaches a little on his designated parkign spit, adn specifcially goes over th ewhite line into his apce. just like SMITh wher the wall built by the L's husband just slight encraoches over into the land leased by the T, it still is a partial eviction amoutning to an actual eviction and the Lls' subequent violation f the covenatn of queit enjoyment. P is therfore not able to enjoy all of the parking spot that is specifically designedted to him in the lease. therfore L woudl have brahced the covenant of quiet enjoymetn under actual eviction. also under the rules of TIC, P coudl argue that he is entitled to equal access of the entire space shared in comon with L. L cannot prevent P at any point from enjoying or using all of the premises promises to him. P coudl also argue that with TIC L has no right to alter or phyically prevent him from accessing common areas withotu his permisson. the second strong arugment P would have is that L vioalted the CQE via a constructive eviction. becuse the scaffolding and navigation argument under actual eviction is a weak arugment, P coudl bring it up under the context of CE.. Similar to the ECHO case where there was a rear entrance to the bank and a rear parking lot, and the praking lot was partially covered by construction equipment, but they coudl still enter through the back door, it substantially interfered with his ability to enjoy the premises. any fact that P coudl raise that isnt' about his phycial deprivation/phycail lack of access to the propety, the second strong arugment P would have is that L vioalted the CQE via a constructive eviction. becuse the scaffolding and navigation argument under actual eviction is a weak arugment, P coudl bring it up under the context of CE.. Similar to the ECHO case where there was a rear entrance to the bank and a rear parking lot, and the praking lot was partially covered by construction equipment, but they coudl still enter through the back door, it substantially interfered with his ability to enjoy the premises. any fact that P coudl raise that isnt' about his phycial deprivation/phycail lack of access to the propety, such as as the difficulty of staff and customers to nagitate the scaffolding, it is nearly imposible to bring a car close to th rear door, all of these udner the reasoning in Echo could amount to constructive eviction. while the orut di not specifically ifnd the circumstnces to be a consturcitve eviction, the court did lay out the measures to fidn CE. with that in mind i coudl advice peter to look to reste realty. becuse the tenant had to deal with water damage that was not a ""permanent"" issue and did not physiclaly prevent her from enjoying the basement and running her business, the court found a constructive eviction because she was unable to propertly run her business, and the total conditions amounted to her being unable to use the premies. becuase of al the facts listed before that Peter has experienced, under Reste realty they likely woudl amount to a CE. in addiiton, P could argue a constructive eviction because although he stil had the pysical access granted to him because P's pizza business uses the rear door and their ustomers use their back lot for parking, he could argue a large part of his business comes from having access to that lot. Peter shoudl rely on the facts that because it is now dificult to use the pabk door for pizzaza deliveries, and its nearly imposible to birng a car cloe the the rear door whcich allows his shop to make pizza deliveries quickly, his businsess is now beign directly impacted. he had to close his shop to that week as well. whiel L could argue that thta was p's decision, adn this woudl then be a weaker arugment for him, he coudl still say that he toherwise would not have gone on vacation if it hadnt been for th repairs L was making and he would have had th epiza shop open to make a profit. he coudl arug ethat e ultimately lost a weeksworth of business. this week of lost busines coudl be somethign P could potentially receive damages for. on top of the one week P was gone, there are fewer customers adn hsi staff has touble makgn on time pizza deliveries. under RESTE, this woudl be sufficient to qulaify for a CE and circumstnces created on behalf of L that so substntially itnerfered with P's ability o run his business and enjoy the premises that he could be entireled to damges and not forced to pay the remiander of his lease. also, even under ECHO, the corut noted that if the circumstances didn't amount to constuitve evictin, which they didn' in that case, the palintiff could still be entiteld to damges. reflecign a more modern view on tenancy. lastly, becuase the construciton is noise and P has be a potential argument for waranty of to keep the wondows cloed b/c of the dust, there 8woudl habitability. the dust specifically ocudl be a health code violatio applicable to restaurants in New suffolk and it coudl create allergies on behlaf of staff and customers. this is a weaker arugment for P (especially P's ability o run his business and enjoy the premises that he could be entireled to damges and not forced to pay the remiander of his lease. also, even under ECHO, the corut noted that if the circumstances didn't amount to constuitve evictin, which they didn' in that case, the palintiff could still be entiteld to damges. reflecign a more modern view on tenancy. lastly, becuase the construciton is noise and P has to keep the wondows cloed b/c of the dust, there woudl be a potential argument for waranty of habitability. the dust specifically ocudl be a health code violatio applicable to restaurants in New suffolk and it coudl create allergies on behlaf of staff and customers. this is a weaker arugment for P (especially b/c it doesn't require T to leave premises) but at the very least he could argue that the noise and dust prohibit him adn the staff and cutomers from enjoying the premises, adn therefore are a CE and L's breach of the CQE. given that the strength of P's argument is centered on COnstructive Eviction, I woudl advise him that he has a very storng argument given thta the has met all 4 elements of the CE. because P calls L to express his concerns, he has taken the first step of notifying the Landlord of the problem. while L could argue she did deduct 100 dollars form his rent, which is a possible remedy of LL's breach, P has a stronger argument because the extent of the interference is so substantial. now that L is aware of the problen and has been put on notice, th enext thing P needs to show is that he alllowed a reaosnable amount of time fo rl to fix the problems. but becuase L just sys to be patient and doe snot probmise when she will have the construction fixed, and the construction then turns into months, P has a veyr strong argumetn, similar to that made on behalf of the T in Hilder v. St. Peter, that he gave a reasonbble amoutn of tiem for the problems to be fixed. furthermore, P calls L every week about the issues, and beause of his continued and frequent notification fo the L of the issues, he woudl have a storng arugment for CE. whiel Hilder provides an argument where the L promises to fix the problemsn but never does, Reste provies an even stronger argument because the T in that situation and let them know aobut he problem, s she also waited a reaosnable amount of time for the flooding to be fixed and even waited about two weeks before leaving. similarly here in P's case, he waited months for the contruction to finally finsiehd, nad becuase the elements of CE do not call for the T to give notice to the LL that htey are leaving due to the conditions, P is jusitifeid in leaving the pizza shop wihtout letting L know. because of all the facts in support of an actual eviction, as well as a constructive eviction and even a possibel IWH, P has a strong case for leaving the pizza show because his revenues form the pizza shop are down and the construction has so substantially interferred with his ability to use and enjoy the shop that he is entitled to leave. I wold let P know that I understnad his reluctancy to leave for fear of being held liable to pay rent given his tenancy for years, but I woudl advise him that given the arguments he has, that it is likely nad becuase the elements of CE do not call for the T to give notice to the LL that htey are leaving due to the conditions, P is jusitifeid in leaving the pizza shop wihtout letting L know. because of all the facts in support of an actual eviction, as well as a constructive eviction and even a possibel IWH, P a has strong case for leaving the pizza show because his revenues form the pizza shop are down and the construction has so substantially interferred with his ability to use and enjoy the shop that he is entitled to leave. I wold let P know that I understnad his reluctancy to leave for fear of being held liable to pay rent given his tenancy for years, but I woudl advise him that given the arguments he has, that it is likely that he will not be repsnbisle for paying th rest of his five year lease. whiel L coudl counter and say the construction was out of her control as the contractor was in charge, and therefore she shoudl not be held liable for any of the issues P encountered, I would advise him that even though L was not directly causing the interferences, as LL she si responsible for not interfereing with Ps enjoymetn of the premise and for supplying a clean premise for him, it is also ultimatly her responsibility to fix the issues illustrated in the above arguments, the durden falls on her. as seen in RESTE, the courts are now taking a move away from odler doctrines of caveat lessee and caveat emptor placing a lot of the burden on teh T to repair the property and support a lack of responsibility on the LL and an overall inequality in the relatioship between the two, and are now tryign to place them on equal footing. furthermore, couts are now lookign at the LL T relationship as a contractual agreement, and becuase of this P owuld have a variety of remedies available to him. he coudl be entitled to dmages in the form of the loss of business, he could also no longer be contractually obligated to pay the remainder of his rent beucase L violated the CQE which the courts now view as breach of her contractual duty as a LL. given the policy rationale now broadening the CQE and tryign to stray away from the ineiquality on the LL T relationship, i think P woudl likely not be held accountable to payign rent for the premise.

8abc5092-b117-4e77-b89b-970f32fafe84," Question 2: The first thing that is important to note with this question is that Peter has a periodic tenancy with his landlord. This means that for a set period of time with automatic renewal he has the rental property. And to break this automatic renewal notice must be given within a set time amount to stop the automatic renewal. In this instance Peter could make the argument that his covenant of quiet enjoyment, CQE, has been broken. He could not make the argument of Implied Warranty of Habilitability due to the fact that this is a commercial space and not a residential one as Implied Warranty of Habitability is used for. For CQE to be broken the tenant must show that through substantial acts that the landlord has control over their use of the space has been disrupted. And under CQE there are three types of action that can occur. The first being partial actual eviction. When there is an instance of partial actual eviction that means that a tenant has lost the ability to use all of the space that they are paying for when paying for their rent. In this case Peter could make the argument that he has been partially actually evicted from his lease because of the fact that the construction equipment that is going into his parking spot. In the wagon case, the court said that even though the wall that the landlord built that went onto the tenants property only went over by a few inches, it was still a partial actual eviction. And the court reasoned this because of the fact that even if it was only a few inches the tenant was still not having full access and use of the land that they were paying for. And the policy rationale with this was that there isn't a good way to renegotate rent and the court wanted tenants to have full access to everything that they are paying for. Now, Linda could make the argument that Peter even admits that he can still get his car into the parking spot, it is just a tight squeeze. And she could also make the argument that she has taken some money off of his rent because of the inconvience and that should be applied to his small amount of parking spot usage that was reduced. But, under the courts reasoning and policy rationale in the wagon case, Peter would have a stronger argument due to the fact that the court said you can't recalculate rent based on a missing percentage once the lease has started. The next type of action that can occur under breach of CQE is called constructive eviction. With the argument that Peter even admits that he can still get his car into the parking spot, it is just a tight squeeze. And she could also make the argument that she has taken some money off of his rent because of the inconvience and that should be applied to his small amount of parking spot usage that was reduced. But, under the courts reasoning and policy rationale in the wagon case, Peter would have a stronger argument due to the fact that the court said you can't recalculate rent based on a missing percentage once the lease has started. The next type of action that can occur under breach of CQE is called constructive eviction. With constructive eviction there are four essential elements that have to be met. First, the interference has to be substantial, second the landlord has to have control over the interference, third the tenant has to have given reasonable notice about the intereference, and finally you have to actually leave because of it. This would be a weaker argument for Peter to make due to the fact that he would have an issue proving the substantial interference element of this portion. This is very similar to the Bank case, where the company was renting space from the bank and when the bank started doing construction there was noise, employees had to use a different door and different parking spaces. The court ruled in that case that there was not constructive eviction because construction noise is temporary and they werre guaranteed access to the building by their lease but their lease never stated how the access was to be granted. The policy rationale with that was just because of temporary inconvience doesn't mean that you have been construcively evicted. In this case, there is still another door that people can use to get in and our of the pizza shop it is just not as convient for them to use, and the construction noise is not a constant. So here it would be difficult for Peter to make the argument that he has been constructively evicted. Also for him to make this argument he would actually have to leave his business. And, if he doesn't win the argument that he has been construcively evicted, which it is unlikely that he will, he would still be liable to Linda for the rest of the rent. The final type of action that can occur under CQE is that of damages. Damages are given when there has been intereference with enjoyment of the property. In the previously mentioned Bank case, damages were awarded to the group that used the basement because of the intereference. So here Peter could make the argument that he should at least be awarded damages for the fact that his business has been clearly impacted by the work that Linda is allowing. He could possibly make an argument for the fact that he should be compensated for the dip in his business that she has caused him. In regards to the breaking of his lease, he could make the argument that under the partial actual evicction of CQE he should be allowed to break his lease because of the fact that he doesn't have full usage of his resigned the lease with the same landlord property. And similarly to reste reality, where the woman because the issues she was having were immediately being solved by the property manager everytime, but then the issues stopped being handled after the second lease had been signed. The court later held clearly impacted by the work that Linda is allowing. He could possibly make an argument for the fact that he should be compensated for the dip in his business that she has caused him. In regards to the breaking of his lease, he could make the argument that under the partial actual evicction of CQE he should be allowed to break his lease because of the fact that he doesn't have full usage of his property. And similarly to reste reality, where the woman resigned the lease with the same landlord because the issues she was having were immediately being solved by the property manager everytime, but then the issues stopped being handled after the second lease had been signed. The court later held that yes even though she signed the lease again the court rejected the idea of caveat emptor because the landlord is in a better place to know about issues the building is having as well as being able to fix them. So the court further reasoned it didn't matter that she knew there was issues when she resigned the lease especially when everytime before when there had been issues they'd always been swiftly fixed and now they hadn't been during a large meeting and that was the crowning blow. Granted, in this case there isn't a crowining blow to this case, but when Peter resigned the lease in January he hadn't had any problems with having the pizzeria there. But, now with this sudden change and construction, there is a large dip in his business and everytime he contacts his landlord there is no end in sight. But, his landlord could also argue that the counstruction will be done at some point and he should just wait it out until that happens. If he did leave before breaking the lease offically while waiting for the courts to decide if he was actually construcively evicted, the landlord has the duty to mitigate damages. Similarly to the case of Somer v. Kridel, the landlord never re let an apartment after the man didn't move in, and then tried to claim the man still owed for the rent even though he never took possession. If Peter were to just leave the landlord would have a duty to mitigate the damages meaning they would need to do a reasonable amount of work to re let the space. That means things like posting that the space is avaliable for rent and doing showings of the resturant space. And the court came with the policy rationale that it would be extremely hard for the tenant to prove that the landlord has taken the necessary steps, so the landlord would need to be the one to take the steps to do so. Peters strongest arguments would be that he has been patially actually evicted from his rented property and that he is entitled to damages, and that he should be allowed to leave because when he resigned his lease for this place the current conditions were not what he was signing for and that these new negative condtions are negatively impacting his business. "," Question 1: In property there are two types of property. There is real property which is items like a house and land, and there are personal property which are other items that aren't property and are not directly attached to the property so for instance your stereo inside your home isn't real property but rather personal property because it isn't integral to your home. When Dana wrote her conveyance, she gave her daughter all of her personal property and her cousin her real property of blackacre. When she wrote this conveyance she did not leave space in the conveyance for her daughterr to have a future interest in Blackacre. However, an argument could be mad that Eve has the land in fee simple subject to executory limitation and that because of the Dana has a shifting executory interest in fee simple absolute to take the land back. And since Dana has died following the laws of a deceased person, that interest then transfers to her daughter Fiona. So now Fiona has the ability to step back onto Blackacre and re take it with her power of executory interest. This argument is made because of the fact that there is a condition that makes it so that at some point Fiona could lose possession over Blackacre, and that possession is lost by her trying to sell the land. So with that there has to be someone that can take the claim of the future interest that has been left open. This is a more difficult argument to make due to the fact that her mother clearly knew how to convey things away and because of the fact that Eve expressed to not have interest in Blackacre, she conveyed nothing to her. So under the rules of conveyance it would be difficult to argue with the intent of the will that Dana intended to leave Eve any of the land due to Eve's expression that she didn't want any of it. If Fiona does have the executory interest in blackacre, then she could make the argument that Eve has the duty not to waste on the property. The idea with waste is that the person holding the future interest should get the property in almost the same condition it was in when the conveyance was first written, with some normal wear and tear. Here Eve has engaged in permissive waste because of the fact that she has allowed the property to fall into a state of neglect over time by not making the necessary repairs. Granted, she has paid the taxes on the land which makes the permissive argument less strong because she was mainting that portion of the property. However there could be an argument under the rules of conveyance that we should read the intent of the the duty not to waste on the property. The idea with waste is that the person holding the future interest should get the property in almost the same condition it was in when the conveyance was first written, with some normal wear and tear. Here Eve has engaged in permissive waste because of the fact that she has allowed the property to fall into a state of neglect over time by not making the necessary repairs. Granted, she has paid the taxes on the land which makes the permissive argument less strong because she was mainting that portion of the property. However there could be an argument under the rules of conveyance that we should read the intent of the will and that her it does not seem that Dana had the intent to give Fiona any interest in blackacre because she expressed that she didn't want anyything to do with Blackacre, and we know she knew how to convey everything to Fiona because of the fact that she conveyed all her personal property to her. Which would then allow Eve to make the argument that she actually does have the property in Fee Simple Absolute and that under the rules of conveyance her alienabiliy over her property can't be taken from her so she should be allowed to solicit offers on the house so she can sell it. this is similar to the case of the handwritten will where the majority stated that yes the conveyance was ambigious so the woman should be allowed to sell the land becuase of the policy rationale to favor the full alienability of the land.And the court did this because the court decided that whenever possible there should be the ability to have the land in Fee Simple Absolute. Also, if Fiona doesn't have a future interest in the land and Eve can't sell the land and has no possible heirs, then there's the possibility the the land will become instestate and that again goes against the rules of conveyance. So to bypass this it would be permissible for Eve to sell the property. Also if Eve does hold the land actually in Fee Simple absolute, because we most favor fee simple absolute under the rules of conveyance then her right to sell the land can't be taken away. So she should therefore be allowed to have the land as her own and do with it as she wishes. ",1561,873
04539f68-a2ad-45cd-8795-db41987eaf6a," Interests Created by Dana's Conveyance: The issue here in this case is determining the various interests created by Dana's conveyance of Blackacre. The rule in establishing a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (""FSSCS"") is that the conveyance uses conditional language. Here, Dana meets this rule becasue in her conveyance she gives Eve blackacre ""provided that"" she does not try to sell the house. Therefore a court could likely reason that she has given Eve a FSSCS interest in Blackacre However, one could also argue that Dana conveyed to Eve a Fee Simple Determinable (""FSD"") interest in blackacre. The rule in establishing an FSD is that the conveyance have durational labuage. Dana also meets this rule as she says in the conveyance that Blackacre belong to Eve ""and only so long as"" she does not sell the home. As a result, a court could also hold that this was to be a FSD interest in blackacre. As a result of the aforementioned analysis of the conveyance, it is evident that the conveyance created by Dana is in fact ambigous. When dealing with ambiguos conveyances there a 7 main rules of construction which courts tend to favor: 1.) Achieve the intent of the grantor 2.) Favor Fee Simple Absolute (""FSA"") 3.) Promote free alienability of Property 4.) Avoid partial intestacy 5.) Favor FSSCS over FSD 6.) Read the coducment as a whole 7.) Favor vested remainders over contingent remainders Here a court could apply the 5th rule (from above) 11 whihc states that a FSSCS should be preferred over a FSD. Dana, as established above has met the criteria for creating this type of interest in Eve. However,this is unlike the Marenholz case where the courts favored an FSD over a FSSCS which flew 5.) Favor FSSCS over FSD 6.) Read the coducment as a whole 7.) Favor vested remainders over contingent remainders Here a court could apply the 5th rule (from above) whihc states that a FSSCS should be preferred over a FSD. Dana, as established above has met the criteria for creating this type of interest in Eve. However,this is unlike the Marenholz case where the courts favored an FSD over a FSSCS which flew in the face of the rules of construction and could be used as a counter argument against this being the type of conveyance laid out in this case. The policy rationale behind FSSCS typically being favored over FSD is that the possibility of reverter future interest that comes with a FSD interest is automatic while the right of enrty/ power of termination future interest that comes with the FSSCS must be excercised. This promotes the actual use of land by people who would actually use it rather than those who could possibly have land revert back to them that they have no intention of using which society has an interest in. An exmaple of this here is Fiona expressing her disinterest in ever returninig to black acre. Arguements for Eve Soliciting Offers Here eve solicits offers for the sale of the house on Blackacre which seems to almost if not directly violate one of the clauses set forth in the conveyance of the land. One of the rules of construction is to properly achieve the intent of the grantor. Here, Eve soliciting offers from the real estate devoloper could be seen as violating the intent of the grantor because Dana states that Eve can sit on blackacre ""provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house. This is just like the White v. Brown case where an ambiguos conveyance was read as the grantors intent to convey a life estate rather than an FSA based on the language she used in her will. Here, is it clear that the home is not to be sold and the mere solicitation of offers or active search of better offers could be viewed as violating this clause. The policy rationale is that courts when faced with ambiguous conveyances would like to best achieve the intent of the grantor which faced with things that are unclear. Using, the dissent to the White v. Brown case, a counterarugment could be made that the courts should look at the language rather than just the intent. In the Brown case, the courts were faced with a conveyance that had given a FSA and a Life Estate which meant that the grantor knew how to convey land and that she was fully capable of creating an FSA if she so desired. Here, using that reasoning a court could say that if Dana did not even want Eve to solicit offeres should could have done so but chose not to and therefore should be allowed to do so freely as she, by the letter of the will, had not violated anything yet. Another way to look at this ambiguous conveyance is to read the document as a whole and by doing so with that rule of construction it is clear that Dana never wanted her home to be sold. just the intent. In the Brown case, the courts were faced with a conveyance that had given a FSA and a Life Estate which meant that the grantor knew how to convey land and that she was fully capable of creating an FSA if she so desired. Here, using that reasoning a court could say that if Dana did not even want Eve to solicit offeres should could have done so but chose not to and therefore should be allowed to do so freely as she, by the letter of the will, had not violated anything yet. Another way to look at this ambiguous conveyance is to read the document as a whole and by doing so with that rule of construction it is clear that Dana never wanted her home to be sold. There are also two types of partioning when it comes to the division or sale of land. One is in kind and the other is by sale. In kind deals with the physical division of the land which does not seem to be an issue here. However, the issue of partitionining in sale does appear to be an issue as Eve is contemplating selling the property. As seen in the Ark Land case where a coal company wanted to sell off the entire plot of land so they could essentially kick the caudills off the flat land, here Eve would like to sell the land as she views the land as a potential gold mine for a future buyer. However, following the case of Ark Land, economic value is not the only test when looking at the partitioning of land by sale. Sentemental and emotional value must also be considered. Here, there is clear emotional value as Fiona after having the ceremony begins to get sentimental about the land and does not want it to be sold and even wants to move back. As a result a court would likely like allow for a partioning in sale as one of the interest of the present party would be prejudiced. However, a possible solution could be that the land be partitioned in kind where the house would belong to Fiona and the rest could go to eve to be sold off. Fiona's Rights To begin, here in the case at face value, Fiona seems to not have any rights to Blackacre or for holding Eve accountable for repairs. By the will of Dana, she left Blackacre to Eve and all of her personal property to Fiona. The difference between real and personal property is that real property involves land and generally anything sitting on that land and personal property is everything else that a person owns. Therefore, by the way that it is laid out in this case, one of the ways for Fiona to be able to reclaim Blackacre is if Eve sells the land or dies. By the the rules of conveyances and the Jurisdiciton of New Suffolk, this being a FSSCS or FSD interest held by Eve would mean that there is a future interest in Dana. Depending on how the courts would rule it would be either a Possibility of Reverter (PoR) or Right of Reentry/Power of Termination (RoR/PoT). As Dana has died, the property or in this case the interest held by her would go to her estate and shall first be distrbuted to issue (direct descendants), then to ancestors (previous lineals relatives) and then to collaterals (brothers/cousins/uncles/aunts etc). Here as Dana has died, Fiona is her issue and therefore the future interest will now be held by her in the Blackacre is if Eve sells the land or dies. By the the rules of conveyances and the Jurisdiciton of New Suffolk, this being a FSSCS or FSD interest held by Eve would mean that there is a future interest in Dana. Depending on how the courts would rule it would be either a Possibility of Reverter (PoR) or Right of Reentry/Power of Termination (RoR/PoT). As Dana has died, the property or in this case the interest held by her would go to her estate and shall first be distrbuted to issue (direct descendants), then to ancestors (previous lineals relatives) and then to collaterals (brothers/cousins/uncles/aunts etc). Here as Dana has died, Fiona is her issue and therefore the future interest will now be held by her in the event that eve violates the the conveyance. However, here under the doctrine of waste, Fiona may be able to assert a claim of ownership over blackacre for an intrest in her property. Property is generally meant to not be altered by those sitting on it and any changes could be viewed as waste. There are generally four types of waste when dealing with land and property: 1) Affirmitive - Taking action that would likely lower the value of the property 2) Permissive - Passively letting the condition of the land deteriorate 3) Ameliorative - waste that increases the value of the property but is change none the lesss 4) Economic - Not doign whats in the best interes of the property to maintain or increase the value (From the highway case in mississippi) Here, Fiona could assert that Eve has committed permissive waste as Eve left blackacre unattended for five years to go to florida and merely locked the doors to the home allowing for windows to break and for shingles to fall from the roof. This is similar to the Barn case where the person sitting on the land did not want to tear down the barn which kept the value of the of property lower as the barn was deteriorating and being of no use to the tenants, an Ohio statute stated that waste which increases teh value of the property is not waste. The policy rationale is that generally land that people do not own, otherwise known as tenants who sit on land"" should not commit waste (or change) on the property. Althought Fiona could possibly assert this claim against Eve, her potentially selling the land could be viewed as it was in Baker v. Weedon where Anna wanted to sell the home for economic prosperity. In that case, the court found a few remaindermen or future interest holders and found that they would need to be consulted for the sale of the land and that the needs and interest of all those holding a future with that holding, here the courts could find interest in the property must be looked at. In accordance that because Fiona is an issue of Dana and therefore likely an issue of Dana (as previously mentioned), should fiona approve of a sale of blackacre the profits would be split evenly amongst them. The policy Althought Fiona could possibly assert this claim against Eve, her potentially selling the land could be viewed as it was in Baker v. Weedon where Anna wanted to sell the home for economic prosperity.

In accordance with that holding, here the courts could find that because Fiona is an issue of Dana and therefore likely an issue of Dana (as previously mentioned), should fiona approve of a sale of blackacre the profits would be split evenly amongst them. The policy rationale for this is that the courts would not like to exclude the interest of people who hold a future interest in a piece of land. It would be rather unfair for someone who posibly had a legal right to a piece of land not to be able to have a say in it being auctioned off. "," STRENGTHS FOR PETER Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (CQE) vs. Implied Warrant of Habitabilty (IWH) The first thing to do in a case like this is to determine whether or not this is a CQE issue or a possible IWH violation as the types of remedy and obligations and dutys of both the tenant and the landlords differ depending on which one it is. The CQE is typically more broad and applies to both commercial and residential leases while the IWH is more narrow and present in all residential leases and it cannot be waived,. It involves the land lord having to ensure that safety and health regulations are being followed and the premises are up to a livable standard. The policy rational is that the court (as seen in the slumlords case) has an interest in preventing the less priviledged from being preyed on by slumlords taking adavantage of people who can only afford to live in certain bad areas. Seeing how this case does not involve a residential lease and that peter has a commercial lease, he must look to the CQE to see what his options are. In order to make a constructive eviction claim under the CQE, certain criteria must be met. First, the disturbance or disruption of proper enjoyment of the property must be caused by the land lord or with the property. Here, Peter could make this claim because the distrubance in his enojoymen of the property is brought on by Linda beggining repairs6 on the property. This is just like the Echo Consulting case where construction of the premises was the cause of the disturbance for the bank. The policy rationale is that the LL upon delivery of the premise is also charge with ensuring that the tenant can what his options are. In order to make a constructive eviction claim under the CQE, certain criteria must be met. First, the disturbance or disruption of proper enjoyment of the property must be caused by the land lord or with the property. Here, Peter could make this claim because the distrubance in his enojoymen of the property is brought on by Linda beggining repairs on the property. This is just like the Echo Consulting case where construction of the premises was the cause of the disturbance for the bank. The policy rationale is that the LL upon delivery of the premise is also charge with ensuring that the tenant can properly enjoy the premises. The next part of the constructive eviction claim is that the disturbance be significant or substantial in interferring with the proper enjoyment of the premises. Here, Peter could argue that this is met because as he notes It is extremely noisy within the confines of his restaurant due to the construction and he is required to keep his windows closed due to the excessive amounts of dust that are entering the building. Also, even though he attempts to keep the shop open during the duration of the construction, he appears to suffer in terms of the amount of costomers that are soliciting business from his store during this time while his delivery staff is having issues navigating the maze of scaffolding that now interrupts the what used to be easy path from the rear parking lot into the building, thus making the deliveries late and likely costing business ffrom unhappy customers or money in terms of refunds and free food awarded as compensation. All of this which Peter can argue as substantial falls in line with the Reste Reality case where the jeweler business suffered from intermitent flooding which would disrupt business from time to time but here the disturbance is constant rather than intermitent which would make the present case seem worse. In the Reste Reality case the court ruled that the intermitent flooding did in fact disturb the natural enjoyment of the premises for the tenant and therefore there was a constructive eviction under CQE. The policy rationale is that LLs are responsible to not interfere with the enojoyment of the premises over the lifetime of the tenancy. Here Linda could be viewed as clearly violating this with the construction and repairs that she opted to begin on the property. Next, the constructive eviction claim involves proper notice of the issue as seen in Reste Reality where the tenant had informed the previous facility manager of the issue of flooding that was at hand in that case. Here, Peter does in fact notify linda to express his concern with his business. Peter even continues to call Linda weekly as the days turn to weeks and then to months to inform her of his concerns and the fact that his business is suffering as a result of the construction that is still going on months later. As a result the court will likely find that proper notice was given to Linda to do someting about the construction and renovations (whether to cease or expedite the process on her own volition). Along with being given proper notice by the tenant of an issue that is interferring with proper enojyment the tenant had informed the previous facility manager of the issue of flooding that was at hand in that case. Here, Peter does in fact notify linda to express his concern with his business. Peter even continues to call Linda weekly as the days turn to weeks and then to months to inform her of his concerns and the fact that his business is suffering as a result of the construction that is still going on months later. As a result the court will likely find that proper notice was given to Linda to do someting about the construction and renovations (whether to cease or expedite the process on her own volition). Along with being given proper notice by the tenant of an issue that is interferring with proper enojyment of the premises, the LL must be given adequate time to fix or solve the isssue at hand. Here Peter gives Linda enough time as he continues to wait through months of the construction in hopes that it finally finishes. This is just like Reste Reality where the tenant waited patiently and even re-rented the space on the reliance of the LL promising to fix the issue. The policy rationale for this is that although landlords are responsible for mending issues with leased property, they also must fair and given enough time to actually fix whatever the isse may be. Finally, the last element of the constructive eviction claim is that the tenant after fulfulling the previous elements must actually vacate the property. Here Peter does not actually vacate the premises so he would be advised to do so immediately. This is unlike the Reste Reality case where the crowining blow of a final flood during a meeting caused the tenant to vacate the premise as required under CQE to make a constructive eviction claim. The policy rationale for this is that courts view that if the problem was as bad a the tenant would lead the cort to believe then they should no longer be on the premises and rent should be witheld until the issue is solved. LINDAS ARGUMENTS (Peters Weaknesses) Linda would likely try to attack the arguement that Peter could make about the substantial nature of the inteference or disturbance of his enjoyment of the premises. Linda could say that this did not rise to the level of being substantial as Peters still kept the restaurant open the entire time and although he had less customers he still performed deliveries and his employees used the scaffolding for work. Also, the customers had the rear parking lot access and the front door the multi-level building to acheive access to the building and even a front door which led directly inside the pizza shop and perhap if the pizza was that good customers could have still made it to him. Linda could also say that even though the delivery cars could not be brought directly to the rear anymore that that was not an exclusive door or method of entry gauranteed by the lease at it merely states ""...together with common righ tof access thereto, a common use of the parking lot.."". This 8isofjust 11 like the fact pattern in the Echo Consulting case where the tenant claimed that construction which barred entry from one door and made it a bit more inconvenient for the tenant and the tenants customers to access the business was a constructive to the building and even a front door which led directly inside the pizza shop and perhap if the pizza was that good customers could have still made it to him. Linda could also say that even though the delivery cars could not be brought directly to the rear anymore that that was not an exclusive door or method of entry gauranteed by the lease at it merely states ""...together with common righ tof access thereto, a common use of the parking lot.."". This is just like the fact pattern in the Echo Consulting case where the tenant claimed that construction which barred entry from one door and made it a bit more inconvenient for the tenant and the tenants customers to access the business was a constructive eviction. In that case the court ruled that that was not in fact a constructive evitction as there was no promised method of entry merely an access point was ensured in the lease which the business still had. The policy rationale for this is that tenancy are looked at more modernly as a contract which can be negotiated around and so long as there is still access to the business and building as a whole the tenant has not been constructive or otherwise evicted from the property. For the element of time to fix the problem Linda could argue that she was being proactive when she initated repairs to make the building better for all the tenants in the tenancy of common for that building and an issue perhaps arose that was much bigger than originally anticipated and therefore repairs were taking longer and that it was out of her control. Linda does not have an arguement against the element of proper notice as she was called weekly after Peter returned the premises about the issues with the construction. Typically when asserting a Constructive Eviction (CE) claim under the CQE there must be a crowning blown as seen in Reste Reality. Here, Linda could argue that there never was a crowning blow because here Peter continues to stay despite the weeks and months of construction and repairs, unlike the Reste Reality case where one final flood during an important meeting finally cause the tenant to vacate the premises. As a result of this and the fact that Peter never vacates which would mean tthat not all elements of a constructive eviction have been met, Linda would likely win this claim Linda could try to assert the caveat emptor however this doctrine has mostly been abolished as it formerly put the responsibility on the leasing party to do an inspection and make sure the that premises were up to par and properly working upon their entry. Now courts have turned to a more contract base approached with the CQE as Landlords (LL or LLs) are usually in a much more powerful position and know the premises better than a potential leaseee. RENT LIABILITY & Damages Peter should in fact leave immediately and begin to withold rent to have a better chance of successfully formerly put the responsibility on the leasing party to do an inspection and make sure the that premises were up to par and properly working upon their entry. Now courts have turned to a more contract base approached with the CQE as Landlords (LL or LLs) are usually in a much more powerful position and know the premises better than a potential leaseee. RENT LIABILITY & Damages Peter should in fact leave immediately and begin to withold rent to have a better chance of successfully asserting his claim of CE against Linda. Otherwise he could be on the hook for the month he leaves and the months thereafter if he leaves to late or the court finds for whatever reason that he did not meet all of the lements of CE Peter could also under the CQE attempt to renogoiate the rent payments with Linda and contract around the construction that is going on. This would reduce his payments from $2000 in light of the fact that he has lost business as a result of these repairs and the inconveniences and slow downs it has caused for his delivery service having to navigate the maze of scaffolding in the rear of the restaraunt. Peter could try to seek compensatory damages to make up for the fact that he has lost out on business during the course of these repairs and contruction. He could present the court with the previous months of business revenue along with the months of revenue since the construction occurred and the court could award these damages accordingly. Linda for intiating repairs on her own accord could be liable to pay Peter back for the week in which she said the repairs would be done and he closed his shop so that they could be done. As rent is $2000/month he could be ""awarded"" $500 in compensatory damgages for that week he was forced to close and not entre the premise due to an interference by the landlord. Peter should put money in escrow or a savings account in case he is in fact found liable for the unpaid rent because he fails his constructive eviction claim and in the event that he rented another spot for the pizza place he would be forced to pay two rents. In such a scenario Peter would want to have enough money to be able to actual pay both rents without defaulting on his payments. Parking Space In terms of the parking space, the issue here is whether or not he has been a victim of a partial actual evicition from his parking spot. The rule is generally that a partial eviction is equivalent to an actual eviction. Here, Peter meets the view markers of someone that has actually been evicted from his parking spot as due to the construction on the premises, his spot has been encroached on by the equipment being left used in the repairs. This is just like the McEnany Brick Wall case where a brick wall slight Parking Space In terms of the parking space, the issue here is whether or not he has been a victim of a partial actual evicition from his parking spot. The rule is generally that a partial eviction is equivalent to an actual eviction. Here, Peter meets the view markers of someone that has actually been evicted from his parking spot as due to the construction on the premises, his spot has been encroached on by the equipment being left used in the repairs. This is just like the McEnany Brick Wall case where a brick wall slight encroached on a piece of land that was being leased and the courts found that this amounted to an actual eviction. The policy rationale for this is that the payment of rent is for the entirety of the negotioted land to be leased and in this rental agreement here, the parking space was included in that. A Remedy for this type of infringement by a LL includes the ability to amend the payment of rent. For example if 20% of the land is being obstructed then the rent should be lowere by 20%. Here, whatever the cost of the parking spot was could be deducted or perhaps Linda could give him another spot that is not being obstructed. She opts to simply reduce the rent by $100. A counterargument to this could be that althought the lease did call for Peter to have his own spot in the parking lot of this favility, it did not seem to specify a specific one and as this is a tenancy in common with pressumably Linda or other businesses in other floors of the building, the entire parking lot is to be shared and Peter could still have his own space just in another one as in a Tenancy in common each tenant has a right to the entire space.

52377785-9281-48c6-97d7-7624e6138022," Dana has left an ambiguous conveyance for the fate of Blackacre, and there are many ways the parties involved, and perhaps the courts if it comes to that, could interpret her conveyance. First we look at the interests that the conveyance created. One option is to read Eve's interest as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS). Normally, this present interest is created by conditional words, such as 'provided that' or 'on the condition that', which are present in Dana's conveyance. In the case of an FSSCS, the grantor, Dana, and her estate once she passes away, would retain the power of termination, which means that once the terminating condition has been satisfied, the grantor (or her estate) can come onto the property and reclaim it. Another option is that we read Eve's interest as a fee simple determinable (FSD). Normally this present interest is created by conditional words such as 'so long as' or 'while', which are ALSO present in Dana's conveyance. If we read the conveyance as an FSD, then the grantor, or her estate, would retain a possibility of reverter, which means that once the terminating event has been satisfied, the property automatically reverts back to the grantor, or her estate. In situations such as these, if the issue comes to the courts, they will use the rules of conveyance to help them figure out the best interpretation of the conveyance. The rules that apply here are the preference for FSSCS over FSD, because it requires the grantor to actively take back the property, which ensures they really want it enough, looking at the intent of the grantor, which can be done sometimes by stepping out of the detailed analysis of the specific words, and their dislike for restricting the alienability of a property. This case is similar to the Marenholtz case, where the court determined that the conveyance created a FSSCS, because they were also dealing with an ambiguous conveyance that could be read as an FSSCS or an FSD. There, the court settles on an FSD, going against the rule of conveyance that prefers FSSCS beacuse they looked at the intent of the grantor and found that it really did specify a condiditon, that the School Board use the land for school purposes. Here, is seems like Dana's intent was similar, she wanted Eve to be able to have and use the property, but she didn't want it to be sold out of the family. Looking at Dana's intent here supports the creation of an FSD because if Eve even takes steps to try to sell the property, it would go back automatically to Dana's estate, and to Fiona. FSSCS, because they were also dealing with an ambiguous conveyance that could be read as an FSSCS or an FSD. There, the court settles on an FSD, going against the rule of conveyance that prefers FSSCS beacuse they looked at the intent of the grantor and found that it really did specify a condiditon, that the School Board use the land for school purposes. Here, is seems like Dana's intent was similar, she wanted Eve to be able to have and use the property, but she didn't want it to be sold out of the family. Looking at Dana's intent here supports the creation of an FSD because if Eve even takes steps to try to sell the property, it would go back automatically to Dana's estate, and to Fiona. This case is also similar to White v. Brown where a woman tried to leave her sister in law her house to live in, but again, she used the words 'the house is not to be sold' just as Dana did. There, the court held that the conveyance was a fee simple absolute (FSA) because of their dislike of restricting alienability. Here, Dana used the same wording, so that could support the creation of a FSA for Eve. Drawing parallels to the White case would be her best argument for being able to sell Blackacre, even though Dana did not want the house to be sold, it wouldn't be out of the question for the court to rule this way. Now that we have some different options regarding how the court would likely look at Dana's conveyance, we turn to the interests of the parties, to analyze what rights and accountabilities they have with regard to Blackacre. Eve seems to want to sell the propery, which was explicitly forbidden by Dana's conveyance. In fact, her interest in Blackacre has been granted only if she does not even ATTEMPT to sell the house. Because of this she should tread very carefully around gathering any offers, lest they be constued as an attempt to sell Blackacre. She did not take any action to receive the first offer, so that is unlikely to be read as an attempt, but further action on her part could be risky. Her only argument to be allowed to solicit offers, is if she discusses with Fiona, and they decide that it will be OK for Eve to gather information regarding the value of the house. If she is careful and puts it in writing, it is unlikely that Fiona could then claim to a court that she was attempting to sell and use this to take back Blackacre. As we saw in the Marenholtz case, where a small change to the use of the property from a school house to a storage area almost caused the School Board to lose the property, Eve could lose the property if she is thought to be attempting to sell it so she should be cautious about getting offers or valuations. And she should argue for the creation of a FSSCS by the conveyance, because that would require Fiona to reenter and retake the property affirmatively, rather than it going back to her automatically. Fiona also seems to want to move back to the property, if she can hold Eve responsible for the repairs created by permissive waste. Waste is defined as changes to a property where there is a future interest holder. Affirmative waste describes changes the present holder makes that leesen the value of the property. Ameliortive waste is when the present interest holder changes the propery to make it more And she should argue for the creation of a FSSCS by the conveyance, because that would require Fiona to reenter and retake the property affirmatively, rather than it going back to her automatically. Fiona also seems to want to move back to the property, if she can hold Eve responsible for the repairs created by permissive waste. Waste is defined as changes to a property where there is a future interest holder. Affirmative waste describes changes the present holder makes that leesen the value of the property. Ameliortive waste is when the present interest holder changes the propery to make it more valuable, but it is still considered a type of waste because it is a change to the property and the future interest holder has a right to possess the property in the same condition as when it was conveyed. Permissive waste describes the deterioration of a property because maintenance is not happening. And economic waste is found when the property isn't being used to its economic potential. Here, as a future interest holder, Fiona can make a case that by locking up the house and letting it deteriorate, Eve created permissive waste, and she is responsible for bringing the house back to the condition it was when she took ownership. As in Baker v. Wheedon, where the court didn't allow the life tenant to sell the house even though she needed the money, here a court would not allow Eve to let Blackacre fall into disrepair. Also using the court's reasoning from the Baker case, the court would not be inclined to allow Eve to sell Blackacre if Fiona didn't want her to, regardless of the wording in the will about not wanting the house to be sold, because Fiona holds a reversion and it would be unfair to her to allow Eve to sell the house; it would not be in the best interests of all the parties involved, even if it would be a great economic boon to Eve. Since Fiona holds either a power of termination or a possibility of a reverter, depending on how we read the conveyance, her future interest is not certain, and she will not definitely take possession of Blackacre. If Eve holds onto the home, and doesn't try to sell it, and then dies, it will continue on to her heirs, or go to the state escheat if she dies without any and no will. Fiona's best option to move into the house may be to make a case that by receiveing the offer from the real estate developer, Eve has attempted to sell the house, and thus she has either automatically or under her power of termination, the right to reenter Blackacre. Another option might be to ask a court to consider her connection to the land, the waste that her aunt Eve is allowing to happen to the property, and ask them to partition the land between her and Eve. As we saw in the Ark Land case, courts value the history and connection people have to the land, and they will do their best to act in the best interest of all parties. In Ark, the court opted not to partition in sale because the owners had a connection to the land, and economic value by the oil company wasn't the only consideration when dealing with the interests of multiple parties. Here, if Fiona truly wants to live in the home she grew up in, perhaps a creative solution can be found to balance the interests of all parties. If Fiona argues that an FSD was created by the conveyance, then she can land, the waste that her aunt Eve is allowing to happen to the property, and ask them to partition the land between her and Eve. As we saw in the Ark Land case, courts value the history and connection people have to the land, and they will do their best to act in the best interest of all parties.

Here, if Fiona truly wants to live in the home she grew up in, perhaps a creative solution can be found to balance the interests of all parties. If Fiona argues that an FSD was created by the conveyance, then she can argue that the reversion happened automatically upon Eve getting offers for the house and that she now owns it in FSA. "," I would advise Peter to break his lease, claim a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE), put some money aside in an escrow account in case he loses his case and is found responsible for the remaining rent, and move his pizza shop to a new location. This would amount to a surrender of the property by Peter, and if Linda doesn't accept it, understanding that she created some very difficult circumstances for Peter, it would amount to an abandonment. However, if Peter can make his case for a constructive eviction, the court will consider Linda's actions a breach of her responsibilities and not hold him responsible for paying the remainder of the rent under his lease. The doctrine of CQE is implied in all leases by common-law, and bars a landlord from interfering with the quiet enjoyment of a tenant the space they have leased. A breach of the CQE can be shown by a contructive eviction, which comonly requires that the tenant show (1) that the landlord's actions interfered with the purpose for which they have leased the space, (2) that the interference was substantial, (3) that the tenant notified the landlord of the interferance or the landlord was aware, and lastly (4) that the tenant vacate the property. As we saw in Reste Realty, when these conditions are met, a court can fid a violation of the CQE and void the lease. Here, Peter can show that the conditions that are interfering with his ability to run a pizza shop result from the landlord's actions, as she has hired the crews to put up scaffolding and do whatever it is they are taking so long to do. Peter can also show that the interference is substantial, although this is probably the weakest part of his claim, since he has been able to remain open and continue to run his business. More on this point below. Assuming he has some records of his calls to Linda, he can show he notified her and she has not made the rear access to his shop easier. And lastly, he will need to vacate the premises, provide proof that he has left and he will have a complete claim for breach of CQE. In a very similar case, Reste Realty, a tenant was constructively evicted from her office space because of frequent flooding, and the court held she had experienced a breach in CQE and was therefore not continue to run his business. More on this point below. Assuming he has some records of his calls to Linda, he can show he notified her and she has not made the rear access to his shop easier. And lastly, he will need to vacate the premises, provide proof that he has left and he will have a complete claim for breach of CQE. In a very similar case, Reste Realty, a tenant was constructively evicted from her office space because of frequent flooding, and the court held she had experienced a breach in CQE and was therefore not responsible for the rent on the remainder of her lease. Here, the facts are very similar. Like the tenant in Reste, Peter is continually facing interference with his business. In Reste, the difficulty was caused by the landlord's failure to act to fix the leaks, but here it is caused by linda's constuction. In Reste, the interference was substantial, as it is for Peter since only a portion of his customers are doing the limbo to get in to buy pizza, and his delivery people are unable to get to their cars easily with large stacks of pizzas. In Reste, as here, the tenant made multiple pleas to the landlord to help remedy the situation but they went ignored. And in Reste, the tenant relied on the good faith efforts by the landlord to fix the flooding before vacating. Peter has also waited a while to give Linda the chance to finish the construction, which she claimed would be done soon, but there is only so long he can wait. In Reste, the court found a constructive eviction prevented the tenant from using her space for the purpose she had leased it for, and I think a court would find the same for Peter. Additionally, Peter has faced a partial actual eviction of his parking space by the constuction equipment. As we saw in the Brick Wall case, where a wall was built that made a minor encroachment onto the tenant's land, a partial actual eviction was as good as a full eviction and the court considered it a breach of the lease by the landlord. Eviction from a portion of the land was considered an eviction from the whole. However, because this is a temporary encroachment of moveable equipment, it may not been seen as very serious by the courts. Additionally according to the modern rule de minimus, a very insignificant encroachment on a tenant's space can be remedied by a small reduction in the rent, and it appears as though Linda has given that reduction in the form of $ f the monthly rent. The weaknesses in Peter's case will likely stem from the substantiality of the interferance. Linda can make a case that the noise, dust, and limited access are more similar to the facts in the Echo Consulting case, where it was not a clear case of constructive eviction. In Echo, the court held that there was no partial eviction due to an access point being closed off, because there were other access points to the space and they were all common to all tenants, there had been no specific right to any one door given in 'a common right of access' to his space, and the the lease. Here, similarly, Peter's lease only gives 6him front door to the shop remains unemcumbered. Additionally, in Echo, the court ruled there was no constructive eviction because the tenants were still able to go about their daily business, even if it was a make a case that the noise, dust, and limited access are more similar to the facts in the Echo Consulting case, where it was not a clear case of constructive eviction. In Echo, the court held that there was no partial eviction due to an access point being closed off, because there were other access points to the space and they were all common to all tenants, there had been no specific right to any one door given in the lease. Here, similarly, Peter's lease only gives him 'a common right of access' to his space, and the front door to the shop remains unemcumbered. Additionally, in Echo, the court ruled there was no constructive eviction because the tenants were still able to go about their daily business, even if it was a little more inconvenient with the construction, Here, Peter's shop has remained open, and people can get in and out, even if it is inconvenient and not as easy as it was before. But, to distinguish from Echo, Peter can point to the fact that in that case Echo was using the space for office work, and so the limitation on the entryways was a mere inconvenience to the workers who had to go in and out. Here, he needs his customers to come in and out all day, so a mere inconvenience could lose him business. There, the interference with the purpose of the space was less than in Peter's situation. The court in Echo remanded on the findings of how bad the noise and dust were, so here they will also probably look closely at how severe the interfernce was for Peter. If Peter does leave, and is found to have abandoned the property rather than having been constructively evicted, Linda does have a responsibility to mitigate damages. This means that she must attempt to find renters to take over Peter's space, and not simply leave it to sit empty. As we saw in the Sommer case, where tenants chose to abandon their leases, courts do not want to encourage tenants to sit on empty properies. It's not fair to the tenants who abandon and it's not good policy, as it would encourage empty properties. In Sommer, the courts held that landlords have a duty to try to fill a space after it is abandoned. They found that two landlords who did not try to fill spaces, and even turned away prospective tenants, could not hold the tenant responsible for the full lease duration, only the amount that it was empty until another tenant was found with good faith effort. Given the specifics of his case, it is unlikely that Peter could make a claim for a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, which also addresses landlords' responsibilities, because it only applies to residential leases in most states.

348838e6-f57b-41dd-bc95-079ad7481a8f," Dana's (D) conveyance of Blackacre to Eve (E) is ambiguous, so an analysis of the conveyance itself is required to determine ownership interests. First, we acknolwedge the numerus clausus principle, which states that a conveyance must fit in to one of the legally recognized types of conveyances for ease and administration purposes. Next, to determine the type of conveyance, we look to the Rules of Construction to provide us with guildelines for interpreting the deed's language. The first rule of construction states that the court should look to and apply the overall intent of the grantor. Here, it seems clear that Dana did not want Blackacre to be sold, evidenced by the unyielding language of ""provided that and only so long as E does not attempt to sell the house. THe house is not to be sold."" In White v. Brown, the court held that an ambiguous conveyance language should be interpreted to grant an estate in fee simple absolute (FSA) as opposed to a life estate. This is also another rule of contstruction. The policy rationale here is that grantees who receive a FSA estate are more willing to invest the time, money, and effort to upkeep the property (as they own it outright) as opposed to grantees who receive a lesser estate (who may not invest the resources to the fullest ability if they know the property will change hands after their death). The court even explounded on the use of the term ""only"" in the White conveyance to reflect the fact that inheritable estates should be transmitted with certainity instead on contingent conditions attached. Here, Eve could be in possession of Blackacre in FSA if the court relies on the fact that Dana's intent was to keep the estate in the family and provide a home for her cousin who she was so close with growing up. However, the dissenting opinion for White v. Brown could also be applied here, in that the specific language of the deed explicitly matters to determine the conveyance that is granted. Dana's ambiguous conveyance thus requires another examination. A rule of construction is that the law prefers to grant a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) over a fee simple determinable (FSD). The rationale here is that for future interest holders of a FSSCS, the grantor who receives the reversionay right to re-entry/power to terminate can elect to reenter the property affirmatively - the grantor may not care that the condition specified in the conveyance was violated or not, as opposed to the future interest holder of a possibility of reverter from an FSD, whose interest is automatically conveyed back to them once the condition is violated, and thus starts the adverse possession statutory clock on the present interest holder (who is now a squatter). The law sees the affirmatively exercised right to re-enter as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) over a fee simple determinable (FSD). The rationale here is that for future interest holders of a FSSCS, the grantor who receives the reversionay right to re-entry/power to terminate can elect to reenter the property affirmatively - the grantor may not care that the condition specified in the conveyance was violated or not, as opposed to the future interest holder of a possibility of reverter from an FSD, whose interest is automatically conveyed back to them once the condition is violated, and thus starts the adverse possession statutory clock on the present interest holder (who is now a squatter). The law sees the affirmatively exercised right to re-enter as a more just and fair future interest than the automatic possibility of reverter. However, the Mahrenholz case contridicts this view and (in Illinois) prefers the grant of an FSD over an FSSCS. The choice of conveyance here is important for the future interests of Fiona (F), Dana's daughter. Dana left her personal property to Fiona, but Blackacre was left to Eve. Blackacre, to our knowledge, was not included on the will that granted Dana's personal property to FIona, and since one of the rules of construction is that wills should avoid partial intestancy, and Blackacre is not included on the will (but needs to be devisable to avoid intestancy), and since the New Suffolk Laws declare that intestate property shall first pass to issue, the future interest in Blackacre could be reasonably assumed to lie with Fiona. Thus, whether Dana granted Eve a FSD or FSSCS determines Fiona's future interest and required action in order to take possession of Blackacre. Applying the rules of contruction and the law's preference, it could be argued that Dana conveyed Eve a FSSCS with the power of termination/right to re-entry resting with Fiona, as inheritor of the future interest to avoid partial intestancy. This conclusion further comports with the Dana's intent to keep Blackacre in the family, as her daughter has the ability to acquire Blackacre from Eve should she attempt to sell the property. As Fiona was feeling sentimental about the property when she returned for her mother's remembrance party, she may choose to exercise this right once Eve entertains the real estate offers. However, Eve does have some legal arguments that support her abillity to sell Blackacre as the current interest holder. Her arguments stem from the law of waste. Eve could argue that she would be committing economic waste by letting the property go unsold, especially as the property has increased in value significantly due to its prime location. The court would look to Baker v. Weedon, wherein a grandmother wanted to sell her stake in her property, but contingent future interest holders were attached. The court held that economic value of a property is not the sole determining factor when deciding whether a judicial sale of land should be authorized. Here, Eve clearly has a interest in selling the property for monetary gain, but Fiona's future interest (right to reentry) and her sentimentality to the land should also be assessed. Furthermore, Eve would be potentially violating the condition in the conveyance if she attempts to sell the property, which the court may also consider dispositive if Fiona were to sue over this issue. From Baker v. Weedon, the court suggests (but did not codify) the fact that parties could sell their interests or negotiate with each other to come to a reasonable compromise. Here, attached. The court held that economic value of a property is not the sole determining factor when deciding whether a judicial sale of land should be authorized. Here, Eve clearly has a interest in selling the property for monetary gain, but Fiona's future interest (right to reentry) and her sentimentality to the land should also be assessed. Furthermore, Eve would be potentially violating the condition in the conveyance if she attempts to sell the property, which the court may also consider dispositive if Fiona were to sue over this issue. From Baker v. Weedon, the court suggests (but did not codify) the fact that parties could sell their interests or negotiate with each other to come to a reasonable compromise. Here, Eve and Fiona could discuss the value of the house and whether Fiona's sentimental interest outweights the price that the house would fetch on the real estate market of New Suffolk. Fiona may decide that the money is more valuable (perhaps to pay off her college loans) than the property itself. However, Fiona may decide that she wants to affirmatively exercise her right to terminate and kick Eve off the property but hold her accountable for repairing it first. Fiona's basis for reclaiming ownership in Blackacre is couched again in the doctrine of waste. Eve both did and did not commit permissive waste here. The two most common types of permissive waste are not paying property taxes, and letting the property fall into disrepair. Here, Eve did set the property taxes on auto-pay, but let the property fall into disrepair over the bitter New Suffolk winters. Fiona could argue that as the present interest holder, Eve was responsible to her, the future interest holder, for upkeeping the property in a manner such that Fiona inherits the property in the same condition as Eve did. Though Eve mitigates one type of permissive waste, she did commit the other type. IF Fiona sued over this, the court could look to Woodrick v. Wood, wherein the court ruled that the common law doctrine of waste, providing that both affirmative and ameliorative waste (improving the property) was not adopted in Ohio as to ameliorative waste, thus meaning that only affirmative waste is actionable. Here, Fiona could argue that while affirmative waste was not committed, permissive waste was, and that should be sufficient to hold Eve accountable for the repairs on Blackacre. "," Peter (P) has some legal options in dealing with his situation. First, we note that Peter holds a term of years lease for five years. A term of years lease has a fixed start and end date, and expires automatically without notice required by either tenant or landlord. This also means that Peter is obligated to pay rent for the five year term that his lease specifies, however, there are some legal ways to naviagte this obligation that will be discussed below. Peter could argue that Linda (L) has breached his covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE). The CQE is a convenant implied in all commerical and residential leases. The CQE provides that a tenant has the right to use the property for its designed purpose and enjoy the property which they leased without intereference from the landlord. A landlord breach of the CQE entitles the tenant to leave the property and absolves the tenant of their obligation to pay the remaining rent in the term of years lease. A breach of the CQE may occur in three ways: actual eviction, constructive eviction, or by damages that do not rise to the level of constructive eviction. In McEnany v. Smith, a medieval property case, a landlord rented a parcel of land to the tenant, but built a wall that partially encroached on their land. The court ruled that this partial encroachment counted as an total actual eviction, which absolved the tenant from the obligation to pay rent. However, the tenant was still obligated to make repairs on the land as required by the other medieval convenants. The policy rationale from this case is that landlords do not rent land in a piecemeal fashion, rather, it is rented as an entire parcel and any partial eviction of the land constitutes an eviction from the whole as a breach of the CQE. Here, Peter's lease stiuplates that he will be granted use of a designated parking spot as his own. The construction equipment ""encroaches a little on this parking spot,"" which results in a tight squeeze for his car when he attempts to park. Peter could make the argument that his CQE has been breached under the theory of partial actual eviction from his leased premises by the landlord's authorization of the construction equipment. If the court found this compelling, Peter could be absolved of his obligation to pay rent for the remainder of his term. However, Linda would argue that it is possible for him to park his car, he just needs to be careful, and thus Peter has not been actually evicted from the premises. Linda's claim would probably prevail in this case, as Peter can still actually utilize the parking space - he is not significantly prevented or imparied from its intended use. tight squeeze for his car when he attempts to park. Peter could make the argument that his CQE has been breached under the theory of partial actual eviction from his leased premises by the landlord's authorization of the construction equipment. If the court found this compelling, Peter could be absolved of his obligation to pay rent for the remainder of his term. However, Linda would argue that it is possible for him to park his car, he just needs to be careful, and thus Peter has not been actually evicted from the premises. Linda's claim would probably prevail in this case, as Peter can still actually utilize the parking space - he is not significantly prevented or imparied from its intended use. Peter may also argue his CQE has been breached under the theory of constructive eviction. Constructive eviction (CE) is dispositive on an interference that significantly impairs the tenant's ability to use the property as it was intended, that it is as if the tenant had been actually evicted. The rule for constructive eviction comes from Reste Realty v. Cooper, wherein a tenant who leased the basement of an office building was successful on a claim of constructive eviction due to her store flooding every time it rained, even though she knew about the condition when she signed the lease renewal. It is imporant to note that the court ruled that the intereference need not be permananet, but the tenant, in order to prevail, must incur a landlord intereference, the interference is significant, the tenant must notifiy the landlord and provide reasonable time to amend the issues, and the tenant must vacate the premises. Furthermore, it is not the intent of the landlord to evict, but the nature of the intereference that is dispositive in determining a CE. Here, Peter's pizza shop is besieged by construction equipment - scaffolding largely limits access to the back door of the shop, cars are prevented from expediently picking up their orders, and dust and noise permeate the environs of his store. Similar to Reste, Peter has called Linda asking when the construction is expected to be finished, which has put her on notice. Though she amenably reduces his rent for the inconvenience, the construction drags on for months on end. Though Linda's intent is not to evict Peter, she is constructively interefering with the operation of his pizza shop, indeed, fewer customers are coming to his store because they are unable to navigate the maze of scaffolding in the back, and revenues from the shop are down. Because the construction has taken an extended period of time to ameliorate, the interference is substantial and he cannot utilize his shop in the manner that it was intended to be used. Though the construction is not a permanenet defect, similar to the intermittant flooding in Reste, Peter has a strong argument for a breach of CQE under constructive eviction. The rationale behind allowing a tenant to claim a constructive eviction is that property law has shifted away from the doctrine of caveat emptor, buyer beware, in which the tenant was required to make repairs on the building as one of their convenant obligations. However, the modern view of property law states that landlords 6know their buildings and the coniditions therein and are the superiorly responsible party for making repairs. Here, Linda is making the repairs, but they have taken long enough to interefer with Peter's business. The remaining action is for Peter to vacate the similar to the intermittant flooding in Reste, Peter has a strong argument for a breach of CQE under constructive eviction. The rationale behind allowing a tenant to claim a constructive eviction is that property law has shifted away from the doctrine of caveat emptor, buyer beware, in which the tenant was required to make repairs on the building as one of their convenant obligations. However, the modern view of property law states that landlords know their buildings and the coniditions therein and are the superiorly responsible party for making repairs. Here, Linda is making the repairs, but they have taken long enough to interefer with Peter's business. The remaining action is for Peter to vacate the premises, which he is entitled to do without being obligated for the remaining rent. Were this to occur, Linda, as landlord would have a duty to mitigate damages and fill Peter's shop with another tenant instead of holding him liable for the outstanding rent payments. This follows the rule set forth in Sommer v. Kridel, which disallows landlords to obligate tenants to pay rent after an abandonment. Finally, Peter may have an argument for the breach of CQE under damages that do not rise to the level of constructive eviction. This rule comes from the Echo case, where the court held that although a tenant was damaged by construction (intermittant noise and dust) and prevented from accessing their building through the front entrance, they were not constructively evicted because the lease did not convey their access to those named provisions expressly. Here, very similar to the Echo case, Peter's lease does not specify that he has the absolute unfettered right to use the backdoor access only. Linda could argue that she has not breached Peter's CQE in any manner because the front door of the pizza shop is perfectly accessible. Linda's claim here is as strong as the Bank's claim was in Echo, namely that the lease signed by Peter did not specify his access to the back door. Peter has a good claim as well for a landlord's breach of the implied warranty of habitability (IWH). Though primarily applied to residentail leases, it can be applied to commerical leases as well. The non- waviable IWH moves away from the doctrine of caveat leasee, where a landlord was only obligated to provide land to a tenant, towards the modern forumlation of a landlord's necessity to provide safe, livable conditions for tenants. Here, Linda's authorization of the construction let dust into his pizza shop, which could find its way into a pizza that is eaten, potentially causing health problems. Peter could argue that this is a breach of the IWH, but the his claim is not very strong here. The solution, Linda would argue, would be to close the windows while construction is going on. However, were his IWH claim sustained, Peter has many legal remedies at his disposal. He could place his rent in escrow until the problem is fixed (here, until the construction was completed), attempt to repair the issues himself and deduct the costs from his rent, or sue for damages. My advice for Peter, considering the above arguments, would be to vacate the premises under a theory of a breach of CQE via constructive eviction. The construction has dragged on for too long, could argue that this is a breach of the IWH, but the his claim is not very strong here. The solution, Linda would argue, would be to close the windows while construction is going on. However, were his IWH claim sustained, Peter has many legal remedies at his disposal. He could place his rent in escrow until the problem is fixed (here, until the construction was completed), attempt to repair the issues himself and deduct the costs from his rent, or sue for damages. My advice for Peter, considering the above arguments, would be to vacate the premises under a theory of a breach of CQE via constructive eviction. The construction has dragged on for too long, while Linda has known about it, with reasonable time to finish and no haste taken to amerliorate the issue. If the court sustains his argument, he is absolved from paying rent for the remainder of his term. Though there are equitable contract remedies availble, as shown by Linda reducing his rent, Peter has a strong claim to recover more by constructive eviction. ",1454,1775
6c430619-e918-45cc-8164-b092cb27ee8a," Grantors intention with the conveyance to Eve House not to be sold Conveyance to Eve has both conditional and durational language in it Rules of construction would favor a FSSCS over a FSD in the event of ambiguity (so we will assume conditional language in force and a FSSCS) Violation of conditional event would create a power to terminate that would have to be exeercised by grantor. Grantor has passed and has devised all of her property to her daughter Fiona She would now have the Power to terminate and re enter Blackacre Clear intent not to have house sold (These are just notes above) The issue here is determining the interests cerated by Dana's conveyance to Eve. The intent of te grantor as per her conveyance is clearly to not have the house sold. Additionally, whle Dana was alive she expressed her desire for it to remian in the family. The conveyance has both conditional language and durational language. If we look to the rules of construction to interpret this ambiguity, the FSSCS would be favored with the policy rationale bbehind that being that it pevents an automatic dislocation from happening to the existing possessory interest. As in ghe MArenholz case where future ownership turned on whether the property automatically reverted to the grantor or on whether the grantor had to re-enter the property and exercise therir rignt, it is an imortant distinction. The FSSCS would require the grantor (or the grantors heirs in the event the grantor has passed) to execise their power to terminate and retake Blackacre. If this conveyance is interpreted to be an FSSCS conditional language and durational language. If we look to the rules of construction to interpret this ambiguity, the FSSCS would be favored with the policy rationale bbehind that being that it pevents an automatic dislocation from happening to the existing possessory interest. As in ghe MArenholz case where future ownership turned on whether the property automatically reverted to the grantor or on whether the grantor had to re-enter the property and exercise therir rignt, it is an imortant distinction. The FSSCS would require the grantor (or the grantors heirs in the event the grantor has passed) to execise their power to terminate and retake Blackacre. If this conveyance is interpreted to be an FSSCS and the power to terminite is necessarily implied by the language, then the grantors heirs can exercise this right upon violation of the conditional language's event. However, it could be argued that the rules of cnstruction can also interpret the conveyance in a different way. There is no specific mention in the conveyance about a future interest that would occur in the event the houss is sold, so the rule that partial inrtensancy should be avoided and that whenever possible a conveyance (unless it expressly states otherwise) should convey an FSA should be followed. That would allow Eve to sell the house without losing possession of Blackacre. Eves argument: Eve would argue that the conveyance did not expressly intend to pass a lesssr estate to her, and that she is in possesion of an FSA which would allow her to sell the property. She could aslo make the argument that regardless of the conveyance, she is now the rightful owner of BA through adverse posession. She could argue that she had lived there previously, and that her possession of BA was in privity with Dana's due to the proper conveyance. She could also argue that Fiona left the property n 2003 so that her 4 years on the estate (before leaving for Fla) since the conveyance tacked on to Dana's prior residence there extended past the 10 year SOL in New Suffolk by 2014, so she could argue for adverse posession taling effect at that time (2014) Adverse Posession Her time spent living there tacked on to Dana's is certainly continuous for longer than the 10 year SOL in force. Dana lived there continuously since 1985 and Eve lived there from 2010 to 2014. Her occupation of the property for the time she spent there was certainly with a claim of right and could be condsidered to be hostile to the wishes of Fiona. Given the objective standard observed n New Suffolk concering her state of mind while living there, it wouldnt matter what her thoughts were regarding adversly posessing the property. Her time spent living there tacked on to Dana's is certainly continuous for longer than the 10 year SOL in force. Dana lived there continuously since 1985 and Eve lived there from 2010 to 2014.

Given the objective standard observed n New Suffolk concering her state of mind while living there, it wouldnt matter what her thoughts were regarding adversly posessing the property. During her time there, she used the home and property as an actual true owner would. Affter all, she was the actual and true owner during that time. She made no effort to conceal the fact that she was living there, as she was actually living there as the rightful owner. Fiona was aware. Her occupation there was exclusive of Fiona's. Even while Dana was still living there, she used it exclusive of Fiona from 2003 on when Fiona moved out ansd went to college. Given that, there was an 11 year stretch where the property was used (exclusive of Fiona) by Eve and Dana (combined via privity). Maybe not the strongest case but one that could be made. Another avenue that Eve could explore woud be to try to strike a compromise with Fiona given that they both have solid arguments for ownership of BA. As in the case with Anna Plaxico who outlived him, and a compromise was struck between her and the future interest holders of the life estate she lived on in order to optimize the outcome between them. In this situation, Fiona's knee jerk emotional reaction to the state of BA could be walked back, and she might agree that she would be better off maintaining her current life-state (that was just fine before her return visit to BA) and selling the property in partnership with Eve, rather than engaging in a costly court battle that might go either way would be the best way to go. Fiona's Argument; The issue here is whether Fiona has a strong right to reclaim the property and to revcover from Eve for the passive waste she has allowed to occur to the estate by her neglect. Fiona would argue that the conveyance should be interpreted as an FSSCS with the condition that the house not be sold, and in the event that the condition is broken, the right of entry would pass back to the grantor or the grantor's heirs. Althought the house has indeed not been sold yet, in the event a sale does begin to develop, Fiona would be able to have 9 day incourt to stop it from hapening and her reclaim BA. It would priobably get messy and Fiona might come to the conclusion that letting a sale occur and splitting th eproceeds might be the way to go. This might best balance the interests of both the passive waste she has allowed to occur to the estate by her neglect.

This might best balance the interests of both (potential) property holders. Passive Waste; Fiona does have the right to try to recover from Eve for the passive waste that has occured to the property due to her neglect. Fiona will argue that her onterpretation of the conveyance does give her a future interest in the property via a right to reenter, and that she shuld expect the property to be in the condition it was at the time of the coveyance. Fiona could also argue against Eve's claim of AP in that there was nothing hostile about her occupation of the property. She was there with the permission of the grantor via the conveyance, and that time spent on BA could not be considered to be hostile and without permission. "," Peter and CQE (and possibly IWH). The question here is whether the interference to Peters ability to do business as usual has been substantially impacted by Lnda's construction project, and if so, what are his options for geting out of the remainder of his lease? Has there been a breach of his CQE? IWH? The disruption caused by the construction is certainly substantial on many fronts, and implicit (and possibly express) in Peters lease is the covenant of quite enjoymnet. Thsi allows for the leasee to enjp tyhe use of their rented space unimpeeded by the LL or anything within the LLs control. The curse of action that Peter would need to follow in order to seek remedy would be; the remainder of his lease? Has there been a breach of his CQE? IWH? The disruption caused by the construction is certainly substantial on many fronts, and implicit (and possibly express) in Peters lease is the covenant of quite enjoymnet. Thsi allows for the leasee to enjp tyhe use of their rented space unimpeeded by the LL or anything within the LLs control. The curse of action that Peter would need to follow in order to seek remedy would be; 1) Is the LL interfering with Peters ability to use his leased space for its intended use? 2) is the interference substantial? 3) if so, notify LL if issues and give reasonable time to remedy 3) If no solutions re forthcoming leave premises in a reaonable amount of time and surrender lease with no further obligations to LL Encroachment Lindas construction has interfered with both his ansd his customers access to the building. This smacks of the Echo case in which construction on the building interfered with the tenents ability to use the space. Additionally, the construction equipment occupying part of his alloted parking space has created a partial actual eviction. Like in the brick wall case, where the cnstruction of brick wall built by a neighbor on a portion of property being rented functioned to actually wrongfully evict the renter from that portion of the property, in this case the construction machineery is doing the same to Peter. Linda may argue that this encroachment is deminimus as he is still able to park his car in the space. That would have to be up to the jury to decide. Regardless, Peter is left with less than he had before and should be compensated. Looking at this encroachment by itself, the older way of looking at the T/LL relationship n sch an instance would be to allow the renter to hold back 100% of the rent until the encroachment was remedied. This was due to the philosofhy that the rent ""was paid on the whle of the land."" A more modern approach to such an incident would to determine some reasonable downward adjustment in the rent to compensate T for his loss Impeeded Access to Building and CQE being able to get in and out easily, and access The very nature of Peter's business relied on customers to the back door is a key part of not only this customer acces, but his delivery business. Any condition that impeeds this access persistently would qualilfy as a breach of his CQE. He is not able to utilize the modern approach to such an incident would to determine some reasonable downward adjustment in the rent to compensate T for his loss Impeeded Access to Building and CQE The very nature of Peter's business relied on customers being able to get in and out easily, and access to the back door is a key part of not only this customer acces, but his delivery business. Any condition that impeeds this access persistently would qualilfy as a breach of his CQE. He is not able to utilize the space in the way he intended. For this to persist for months is longer than a reasonable amount of time. Ths alone would give Peter a strong case that he was being constructively evicted. As in the Reste case, the tenants ability to carry on their biz as usual was impacted by the LL. Given that in Reste it was the LLs failure to act that resulted in the contrructive eviction, and in this case it is activity proactively being carried on by the LL that is having the impact, either way it could be cnsidered to be amounting to a constructuve evinction. Possible IWH Peter may also have an argument for a breach of his implied warrant of habitability. Even though this is a comercial and not a residential space, and the IWH is mainly applicable to residential, It may be the case that teh more difficult access to the rear door is causing a safety issue, and that in the event of a fire custmers lives could be at risk. If this was the case, Peter might be able to hold back rent while this condition persists. Linda would argue that Peter still has access to all of the doors he had access to prior to the work commencing, and that he is still able to park his car in his space due to the 'de minimus' encroachment, so although there is some incinvenience, it will nt be permanent and he is still able to run his business from the location. Like in the Echo case, where the disrupition caused to the tenant was foujd not to amount to constructive eviction because they could still get in and out , they were still able to conduct their biz from the locartion, and the disrtuption wa only temporary, Linda would argue that in this instance the situation is similar. Looking at this as a whole, it is worth mentioning that these legal rights that Peter has in this instance are a result of a major change n the way the laws look at the LL/T relationship. Over the last several decades, the older philosophy of 'caveat-leasee' that giverned the LL tenant relationship has been replaced with a more modern cnotract based approac, one in which the very unequal balance of power that tends to exist between LLs and Ts and the view that covenants between LL and T were separate from each other and not mutual. It was recognized that the LL is in a better postion (both financially Looking at this as a whole, it is worth mentioning that these legal rights that Peter has in this instance are a result of a major change n the way the laws look at the LL/T relationship.

It was recognized that the LL is in a better postion (both financially and in terms of knowledge) to make repairs and re-rent spaces, and is under an obligation to provide the tenand with a CQE and a safe and healthy place. The Reste case, the Hilder case, and the berg case (although no issue of self help in this instacne) all helped to move LL/T law into a modern cnatract based approach. I do think that Peter's arguments are stronger than Linda's, as he is most definately being negatively impacted for an unreasonable amount of time. Although a court would have to ultimately decide, a constructive eviction would allow Peter to vacate the premises (provided he has followed the 4 steps outlined above) with no further obligation on the balance of the lease. Linda's Obligation to Mitigate In the event that Peter does claim constructive eviction and leaves before his lease is up, Linda could bring suit against him to try to claim any unpaid part of the remaining lease, with some limitations. Like n the Sommer case, where the tenant surrendered his lease early and the LL refused to accept his surender and instead considered it to be an abandoment with a remaining obligation, Linda would have an obligation to mitigate the damages Peter would incur by having to continue to pay on his lease. She would have to proactively try to re-let the space, and the burden of proof would be on her to demonstrate her efforts. In the SOmmer case, the LL failed to do this and actually turned away prosepctive renters for the emopty apartment. The decision in this case brought about a new way of thinking about the LLs obilgations in such an instance, given that the LL is in a better position to re-rent the empty space that the ex-tenant would be. Previous to this case it was not the accepted practice that the burden to fill an abandoned lease would be palced on the landlord, forcing the LL to look for new tenants. ",1471,1492
2b1e1d8d-9ec0-4c7a-970e-4dca363f75b2," Question 1 1a) Interests created by Dana's conveyance The interests created by Dana's conveyance use both conditional ""provided that"" and durational language ""so long as"", making the conveyance ambigous. Based on the conveyance, Eve will either have a fee simple absolute or a life estate. If Eve has a life estate, then Fiona would have an indefeasibly vested remainder in fsa. The rules of construction are applicable here in order to construe the conveyance. The first applicable rule is that the courts want to avoid partial intestacy, the second rule is that the courts favor alienability and the third applicable rule is that the courts favor a fee simple absolute. It is also important to note that because Danas husband died before she did, he did not get to absorb Dana's portion of ownership at her death as a tenant by the entirety and under the rule of the right of survivorship and under the unity of marriage which, is why she is able to convey her interest in the property. Here, Dana's conveyance states that she conveys the property to her cousin Eve provided that and so long as Eve doesnt attempt to sell the house. Based the rules of construction, this conveyance would give Eve a fsa rather than a life estate because that way, eve would be able to alienate the property and would have the right to do whatever she wanted with it. However, if the court interpreted the conveyence to mean that Dana stated that she did not want the property sold and wanted Eve to have a life estate, then Fiona would have a future interest being an indefeasibly vested remained. Another way the conveyance could be interpreted is that Fiona has a shifting executory interest in fsa and eve has a fee simple subject to executory limitation. Also, the courts could construe the conveyence to be a FSD in eve although the rules of construction favoring a fsscs over fsd - like the mahrenhals case. Because the conveyence doesnt expressly state that the property go to a third party. The rule of construction that courts want to avoid partial intestacy would support Fiona having a future interest because Dana conveyed all of her personal property to Fiona. However, the courts ruling in the White v. Brown case would support that Eve had an fsa. In White, the property was left to the niece in an ambigous conveyance, the court considered all the factors and ultimately decided that in order to avoid is partial intestacy and promote the free alienability that 7 given in fsa, the conveyance was read to give a fsa regardless of the language stating not to sell the property. Accordingly, the court will likely conclude that Eve has a fsa and Fiona has nothing. construction that courts want to avoid partial intestacy would support Fiona having a future interest because Dana conveyed all of her personal property to Fiona. However, the courts ruling in the White v. Brown case would support that Eve had an fsa.

Accordingly, the court will likely conclude that Eve has a fsa and Fiona has nothing. 1b) Eve's right to sell the property Eves right to sell the property depends on whether or not she is a life tenant or has a fee simple subject to executory limitation or owns the property in fsa. If she is a life tenant, she will not be able to sell the property because life estates are not alienable unless transfered to another person as a gift that would end that the transferors death. To support Eve's right to sell the property, she could use the Baker case where the wife who had a life estate wanted to sell the property. The grandchildren who had a contingent remainder did not want to sell the property due to its ability to increase value over the following years. The court considered the life tenants ability to pay taxes, the lands economic value, the deterioration of the property as well as the best interest of all parties when they decided to partition the land in sale. By using this case to support her arguement, she could also add that she had a long standing history and sentimental interest in the property. Howver, the court in Baker ruled to partition the land in sale and give Anna funds to live off of because she was unable to support herself otherwise and because she had a strong sentimental attatchment and interest in the property, they considered the best interest of all parties in addition to deterrioration and waste. The court ruled that given all the factors considered, in fairness they would partion the land in sale and give Anna funds to live off of. 1c) Fiona's basis to reclaim ownership & hold Eve accountable for repairs needed The issue is whether fiona can reclaim ownership. Fiona could try to reclaim ownership by arguing that the origional conveyance gave eve a fee simple subject to executory limitation and gave fiona an executory interest that could divest eves interest should she try to sell the house. If this is the case, then fiona could reclaim ownership since eve ""attempted to sell the house"". However, if the court rules that Eve does in fact have a life estate, and that Fiona has a remainder, as a life tenant, eve has a duty to refrain from causing waste to the property. The waste doctrine includes three types of waste, permissive, affirmative and ameliorative. By leaving the house unattended while she was away, Fiona could argue that Eve committed permissive waste due to her negligence. However, eve could argue that she didnt act negligently because she set up auto-pay on taxes. On the same token, Fiona could argue fiona an executory interest that could divest eves interest should she try to sell the house. If this is the case, then fiona could reclaim ownership since eve ""attempted to sell the house"". However, if the court rules that Eve does in fact have a life estate, and has that Fiona has a remainder, as a life tenant, eve a duty to refrain from causing waste to the property. The waste doctrine includes three types of waste, permissive, affirmative and ameliorative. By leaving the house unattended while she was away, Fiona could argue that Eve committed permissive waste due to her negligence. However, eve could argue that she didnt act negligently because she set up auto-pay on taxes. On the same token, Fiona could argue that eve commited affirmative waste by her conduct, being that she abandoned the house. Fiona could also argue tha eve commited economic waste by not putting the property to its most productive use because it is clearly profitable land and rather than taking care of the house, she let it deterriorate. Another arguement that Fiona could make is that Eve breached the implied warranty of habitability. The implied warranty of habitability requires that eve, as a landlord provides habitable housing. Additionally, implied warranty of habitability is implied in all leases and regardless of fionas knowledge of the demise and state of the premise, eve is still accountable for the condition of the property and is liable to fix and repair its damages. Under the implied warranty of habitability, the landlord is responsible for making repairs to the property, unlike the out date caveat lessee theory which provides that the landlords only obligation is to give possession of the property and despite its condition. Further, this theory states that it is up to the tenant to fix the property. Given the that the status quo has evolved and tenants now rely on the landlord to provide adequate housing, Fiona could further argue that eve is responsible for the repairs. Similar to the Hilder case where the landlord leased property that had broken windows and posed as a serious health and safety risk to the tenant. The court in Hilder ruled that the landlord was liable to pay damages for the property. Here, the broken glass and missing shingles among other problems are likely to pose a serious health and safety risk to fiona if they are not fixed by eve. Accordingly, fiona will likely be able to hold eve accountable for making the repairs to the home by arguing that eve comited waste and breached the implied warranty of habitability. "," 2a) Peter's claim against the landlord for breach/ The issue is whether Peter has a claim against the landlord for breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) is implied in all leases and obligates the landlord to provide the tenant with possession of the premise. Further, the landlord promises to refrain from interfering with the tenants expectation, possession, use or enjoyment of the property. Breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment by the landlord tend to result in eviction and/or damages. Actual eviction 2a) Peter's claim against the landlord for breach/ The issue is whether Peter has a claim against the landlord for breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) is implied in all leases and obligates the landlord to provide the tenant with possession of the premise. Further, the landlord promises to refrain from interfering with the tenants expectation, possession, use or enjoyment of the property. Breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment by the landlord tend to result in eviction and/or damages. Actual eviction requires that the landlord physically dispossess the tenant. Partial eviction requires that the landlord partially physically disposes the tenant. Partial evication gives the tenant a basis for an arguement against constructive eviction because the premises of the lease cannot be aportioned and therefore, the exent of the physical disposession is not relevant. Constructiv eviction requires that the landlords actions are so tanamount that they ""as if"" disposses the tenant from the premise even though the landlord doesnt physicall disposses the tenant. In each of these evictions, the tenant is requires to vacate the premise within a reasonable time. Lastly, the tenant can also claim damages for the landlords disturbances and breach. Covenants of quiet enjoyment are usually applied to commercial and term of years leases. Here, Peter's lease is a commercial term of years lease which, gives basis to his claim since periodic tenancy or tenancy at will leases can be terminated within reasonable time whereas, a term of years lease only terminates at the end of the term. Like the Echo case, where the buildings consturction was affecting the banks access to entrances and caused loud noise and distraction, here, the construction and the scafolding was so noisy and caused him to keep his windows closed due to dust, and largely blocks the access to the rear door which, his pizza shop used regularly and was helpful to customers who park in the parking lot, and caused his staff to have trouble making deliveries on time because it is hard to carry the pizzas through the maze of scaffolding and his staff found it nearly impossible to bring a car close to the back door. Further, Peter started to notice that fewer customers were coming to the shop which, he could argue was related to the distrubances caused by the ""noisy"" construction. In the Echo case, the court argued that although the construction was a disturbance, the entrence to the building was not designated to the bank under the lease and was ""common"" to everyone and therefore, blocking some entrances did not rise to the level or actual or partial eviction. Here, the landlord will argue that lease gave Peter ""common right of access thereto"" and ""a common use of the parking lot and one designated spot"" and although he is annoyed that the back enterance was blocked off, that does not constitute a violation of his lease. The landlord could also argue that the entrance to the pizza place is on faces the main street which, gives easy access to the shop. Peter could try argue that the landlord partially evicted him due to the physical dispossession and encroachment of the construction equipment in his designated parking spot. Unlike Echo where the court found that the construction did not rise to the level of partial evication, Peter could use the smith case to support his arguement for partial eviction. In gave Peter ""common right of access thereto"" and ""a common use of the parking lot and one designated spot"" and although he is annoyed that the back enterance was blocked off, that does not constitute a violation of his lease. The landlord could also argue that the entrance to the pizza place is on faces the main street which, gives easy access to the shop. Peter could try argue that the landlord partially evicted him due to the physical dispossession and encroachment of the construction equipment in his designated parking spot. Unlike Echo where the court found that the construction did not rise to the level of partial evication, Peter could use the smith case to support his arguement for partial eviction. In the Smith case, the landlord encroached on the tenants property only a few feet but the court still ruled that this constituted a partial eviction since the exent of the encroachment is not relevant given that the tenant leases the entire premise and cannot aportion the premise. Further, in the smith case, the court ruled that the tenant could refrain from paying the entire rent. However, the landlord here could argue that modern approaches to partial eviction require that the tenant and landlord renegotiate the rent which, she did by reducing peters rent by $100 a month. Peter could argue that the landlord constructively evicted him. Constructive eviction is present when the landlords disturbans is so tantamount to his use and expectation of the property. Additionally, the four elements of constructive eviction require that the the landlord is responsible for the interference, that the interference was so substantial, that the tenant notified the landlord of the issues and that the tenant vacated the propery. Here, the landlord could argue that although she was responsible for the interference, it was not so substantial since it was temporary. However, to this point, Peter could use the Reste case where the flooding in the building was not permanent but the court held that a disturbance doesnt need to be permanent to constitute constructive evicition. The landlord here could also argue that she knew of the interferences and responded to them in a reasonable manner and tried to fix the disturbance they were causing. Moreover, she could argue that peter never vacated the premise and therefore, lost his claim of constructive eviction. Peter could try argue that he is entitled to damages for the distrubances due to the construction. To support his arguement for damages, he could provide proof of the decline in customers and declined revenues and could try to argue that the decline is due to the construction, blocked off parking, noise, scaffoling and dust. Further, peter could argue that his rent is $2000 and the $100 that the landlord is deducting from his rent is not sufficient. Accordingly, the court will likely find that peter does not have a claim against the landlord for constructive eviction since peter didnt vacate the premise. However, the court will likely award peter with damages due to the distrubances. I would also advise him to put money aside into escrow until his claim is resolved. $100 that the landlord is deducting from his rent is not sufficient.

d16fe8d2-bea5-4a56-bbd8-8f8bd80bfe97," Question 1: Conveyance: It seems as if the conveyance is ambigious and if so then the court will use the rules of construction. The interests that were created by Dana's conveyance are the following: Eve has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) and Dana has a power of termination/right of entry. Eve has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because the conveyance is ambigious and it is in between a FSSCS and a fee simple determinable (FSD) due to the language of the conveyance. Therefore, the rules of construction favor a FSSCS over a FSD and the future interest that follows a FSSCS is a power of termination/right of entry, which is why Dana has that. Eve The rules of construction would support Eve's argument that she should be permitted to solict other offers for the sale of Blackacre. The rules of construction are the look for the intent of the grantor, favor fee simple absolute, avoid partial intestacy, favor alienability of property, favor fee simple subject to condition subsequent over fee simple determinable, favor vest remainders over contingent remainders, and read the document as a whole. These rule are used when considering ambigious conveyances. This case is similar to the White v. Brown case and Mahrenholz v. County Board, where the court looked to rules of constructions and determined to favor fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) over fee simple determinable (FSD). Eve can argue that the court would find her present interest to be a FSSCS and the grantor must exercise their power and terminate the present possessor's interest if they break the condition. At this point Eve is interested in other bids but she has not atempted to sell the house; therefore, she has not broken the conditions so she still has a rightful present possession. If the court were to find that this was a fee simple determinable because of the durational language, Fiona still would not have present possession since Eve did not break the condition. Additionally, Eve can argue that although the conveyance specifically states ""the house shold not be sold"" the conyeance is ambigious so the house can be sold as it was in White v. Brown, even present interest to be a FSSCS and the grantor must exercise their power and terminate the present possessor's interest if they break the condition. At this point Eve is interested in other bids but she has not atempted to sell the house; therefore, she has not broken the conditions so she still has a rightful present possession. If the court were to find that this was a fee simple determinable because of the durational language, Fiona still would not have present possession since Eve did not break the condition. Additionally, Eve can argue that although the conveyance specifically states ""the house shold not be sold"" the conyeance is ambigious so the house can be sold as it was in White v. Brown, even when the conveyeane specified not to sell the house. Depending on the way the court reads the conveyance the arguemnt can be weaked in multiple ways. If the courts find that this was an FSD then Eve does not have the right to convey the land because by attempting to sell it, would break the condition and Fiona would automatically have title. If the courts find that it is an FSSEL Eve could be revoked of her possession if Fiona exercises her right to enter the property. The policy rationale of favoing an FSSCS over an FSD is to have the grantor exercise their interest in the land. For example, if the court rules Eve has a FSSEL and then tries to sell the house she techincally is still in possession since the grantor never exercised their future interest (right of entry or power of termination). Eve can argue that the courts should look to the best interests of the parties, which would grant her to sell the land. The concurring/disent in Ark Land v. Caudill, acknowledged that economic interest should not be the sole factor in determing whether land should be sold or not and the courts should look to the best interests of the parties. Our case is similar to that case because the disent argued that although the Caudill's had sentimental value to the property they used it only on weekend. The disent state that the courts would have likely ruled in favor of Ark Land if that compnay wanted to create high ways instead of mines. Here, Fiona has not been to the property in 5 years, which shows that the property does not have a strong sentimental value to her. Therefore, Eve can make a strong arugment that she should be able to sell the house not to produce economic waste; epecially beause neither party has a signficiant attatchment to the property. The policy here is to reward untilzation of the land. Especially, if one of the buyer is planning to do something of high value and productivity. However, the courts want to promote profitable practices but they also do not want to sell away land against the owners wishes if they are attached to it, which is why they look to the best interests of both parties. Additionally, Eve can aruge that not selling the property would create economic waste. neither party has a signficiant attatchment to the property. The policy here is to reward untilzation of the land. Especially, if one of the buyer is planning to do something of high value and productivity. However, the courts want to promote profitable practices but they also do not want to sell away land against the owners wishes if they are attached to it, which is why they look to the best interests of both parties. Additionally, Eve can aruge that not selling the property would create economic waste. Economic waste occurs when the land is not used in the most productive way. Our case is similar to Baker v. Weedon, where one party aruged that economic waste would be committed if they sold the hosue too early. The court looked at the best interest of the parties and tried to come up with a solution to help the plaintiff in need of money, while satifying the needs of the other party. Eve can aruge that at the least the parties should be able to split the house and divide the earnings. This policy is known as equitable division that was used in Poopov v. Hayashi and it is typically a remedy for parties that have a shared interst in property. Fiona Fiona can aruge that since Eve is interested in hearing other bids on the house that shows an interest of selling the house which violates the condition. Fiona, would be able to claim back Blackacre and possess it in fee simple absolute. If the court looks to use the rules of construction becasue this is an ambigous conveyance they will likely look to the intent of the grantor, and rule that the house should not be sold or attempted to be sold. Similar to the Mahrenholz v. County Board case, the court will likely find that this conveyance was a FSSCS rather than an FSD. Since Fiona obtained the rights through her mom's will of the being the grantor to this property, all Fiona would have to do as the grantor is exercise her right to enter the premises to reclaim ownership of Blackacre and terminate Eve's interest. The policy here is similar to the one listed above that courts are looking for grantor's to exercise their interest in the property. If Fiona was not aware that Eve broke the condition and never re- entered the premises that shows that Fiona was not that interest. Fiona could weaken Eve's argument by stating that economic interest is not the only factor the courts look at when determining if the land should be sold, as seen in Baker v. Weedon. Fiona can aruge that the land is of great sentimental value to her which outways the economic factor of conveying the land. Since her mom lived here her whole life and she never relaized how much she missed the The policy here is similar to the one listed above that courts are looking for grantor's to exercise their interest in the property. If Fiona was not aware that Eve broke the condition and never re- entered the premises that shows that Fiona was not that interest. Fiona could weaken Eve's argument by stating that economic interest is not the only factor the courts look at when determining if the land should be sold, as seen in Baker v. Weedon. Fiona can aruge that the land is of great sentimental value to her which outways the economic factor of conveying the land. Since her mom lived here her whole life and she never relaized how much she missed the property until she visited without her mom, which explains why she has not been within the last five years. Additionally, Fiona can aruge that Eve has committed permissive waste by abadnoning the premises for 5 years. Eve should have known that leaving the premises unattended for for 5 years would results in missing roof shingles, cracked glass, and other serious problems. By locking up the house and moving to Florida shows that Eve does not care about the property since she has not done anything to care for the property. Fiona can aruge that as the present possessor that it is Eve's duty to maintain the property and her voluntary act of moving to Florida was affirmative waste which decreased the value of the property. Since Eve does not possess the property in fee simple absolute she is liable for the waste she committed. In the Woodrick v. Wood case, where the present possessor removed soemthing from the land to increase the value of the property (ameliorative waste), the future possessor sued for damages. If Fiona sues Eve for damages it is likely that they will find Eve responsible for committed waste since in Woodrick v. Wood, since the planintiff has to pay the defendant for ameliorative waste, which is only followed by traditional common law. The policy here would be to promote fairness and certainity since both of the parties share in interest in the property the courts want to be able to set a basis to create equal access to the value of the property. The weakenness to Fiona's argument was that her absence of five years shows her lack of interest in the property. Although within those five years she did not have a present interest, she told her mom (when she was alive) that she had no interest in returning back to New Suffolk. Another weakness to this arugment would be that Fiona was only granted a future interest in this property through the death of her mother so there potentially is a lack of interest. "," Question 2 Peter Strengths (includng options as to what he can do) Since Peter entered into a tenacy of years lease he is oblgiated to pay monthly until December, 31, 2023. As a tenant, Peter is apart of an either expressed or implied coverant of quiet enjoyment which permitss the landlord for interferring with the property of the tenant for the duration of the tenancy. In the lease, it specifically states that Peter is entilted to ""common right of access"" to the building. This is similar to the Echo Consulting Case, where the court found that Echo was not entitled to a constructive eviction since the lease included the ""common right of access"" clause but Echo was still granted damages for the disruptivness of the constuction and other factors. There are a few ways that a landlord can breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The first way is an actual evicition could be partial or total. Here, Peter was partially actually evicted because the cosntruction equipemtn encoraches a little on his designated parking spot. Althought this encorachment is not about of the 2000 swuare feet of the lease, the designated parking spot was something he was entilted too within the lease. Therefore, an actual inferefence of the leased premises can be considered a partial actual eviction even though it is a small encorahcment, as we saw in Smith v. Mcenany. When a partial actual eviction occurs the tenant can sue for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment or deduct part of its rent. The policy rationale here is fairness since the orginial payment agreement was based off of the orginial about of space given. Another thing Peter can do is vacate the premises and argue that he was constructivly evicted. A constructive eviction occurs when a landlord substantially interferes with the tenant's occupancy through actions other than actually taking the area they are entitled to. Constructive eviction only applies to interfernce by the landlord, the landord's successors, or those with paramount title. Since the landlord hired these people Linda is still on the hook for potential constructive eviction. Peter would have to show that the breach was substantial as it 6was in the Reste Realty case, where the tenant had enormous amounts of flooding and had to relocate to do her job. Peter would likely have to make an argument that the construction work is substantially interfering with his job not only the access to the constructive eviction occurs when a landlord substantially interferes with the tenant's occupancy through actions other than actually taking the area they are entitled to. Constructive eviction only applies to interfernce by the landlord, the landord's successors, or those with paramount title. Since the landlord hired these people Linda is still on the hook for potential constructive eviction. Peter would have to show that the breach was substantial as it was in the Reste Realty case, where the tenant had enormous amounts of flooding and had to relocate to do her job. Peter would likely have to make an argument that the construction work is substantially interfering with his job not only the access to the building. There are four elements that must be completed in order to have a proper claim of constructive eviction. First, there must be an inference by the landlord that does not include depreving the tenant of the land. Second, this interference must be substanital. Third, the tenant must notify the landlord. Foruth, the tenant must evacate the premises. When there is a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the tenant is allowed to withold rent under the constructive eviction. If the tenant defaults on rent and the landlord sues the tenant can rise breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment and sue for damages.The policy rationale here is covenats are mutually dependant if the landlord breaches then the tenant should not be entitled to pay. This policy reject the traditional common law of cavet emporor in which covenant were seen as mutually independant, even when there was a breach by the landlord the tenant was required to pay. Since vacating the premises is risky Peter has a few other options. He can either abandon or surrend the premises. Abandonment occurs when the tenant defaults on their payment and vacates the premises. An abadonment would not be the best advice since Peter would likely be liable for breaching his contract. Surrendering the premises occurs when the tenant and landlord agree on terms that removes the legal obligation of the tenant. However, if the landlord and tenant do not come to an agreement and Peter decides to leave then he will likely be liable for abandoning his property. If Peter were to surrender the premises as the plaintiff did in Sommer v. Kridel, the landlord would be responisble to mitigate the damages. The policy rationale here is that the landlord's are more familiar with this market and can find someone easier then the tenant. The burden is on the landlord to prove they gave their best effort to mitigate the damges (through ads or magazines). The last few options for Peter is that he can assign or sublet his apartment to a third party if Linda allows him to. An assignment occurs when the tenant conveys the remaining interest of his tenancy to a third party and a sublease occurs when the tenant conveys less then the remaining interest of his tenancy to a third party. Under common law, when these interests are conveyed court typically look to the remaining interests; however, the modern rule is to look to the intent of the grantor. If Peter chooses do convey his interest into a third party he must be careful as to how he does it becasue may be liable. The last few options for Peter is that he can assign or sublet his apartment to a third party if Linda allows him to. An assignment occurs when the tenant conveys the remaining interest of his tenancy to a third party and a sublease occurs when the tenant conveys less then the remaining interest of his tenancy to a third party. Under common law, when these interests are conveyed court typically look to the remaining interests; however, the modern rule is to look to the intent of the grantor. If Peter chooses do convey his interest into a third party he must be careful as to how he does it becasue may be liable. However, ever since the adaptation of the modern rule courts are generally looking to the intent of the party as the did in Ernst v. Conditt. Depending if he conveys his interest as an assignment of sublease will determine the privity between the parties. If it is an assignment Peter will only have a privity of contract with the landlord but if it is a sublease Peter will have a privity of contract and privity of estate with the landlord. It would be in Peter's best interest if he could to sublease hid apartment for a couple of months because it is likely that the construction will be done soon and less likely that he will get a claim for costructive eviction. Weaknesses (Linda's arguments incldued) Although there are many options of Peter he likely will not be able to deafult on rent for two reasons. First, when Peter notified Linda about his concern she compensated him for the partial eviction by deducting his monthly rent by $100. That is typically the remedy for partial actual evicition, so it is likley if he brought her to court on that basis he would lose. Second, Peter has to prove a substantial breach by the landlord. In the lease it says he is entitled to ""common right of access"". Although he runs business out of both of the front and back down he still has access to his building. Maybe it is not the most convienent but he still has access. If the court were to rule the same way they did with the Echo Consulting they would say that since the lease indicated that it was a ""common right of access"" Peter was not actually or construcitvely evicted. Since covenants are mutually dependant Linda rightfully deducted $100 from the monthly rent. In order for Peter to still make a claim against Linda for partial actual evicition he would have to argue that $100 was not enough for the amount of customers and business he had lost due to her construction. However, Linda could aruge that she was only legally oblgiated to give 2000 swaure feet of the floor area with a common right of access, a common use of the parking lotm and one designated parking spot. So since her worker's equipment were only the line alittle of his designated area she compensated of it. It is likely that Peter's only way to prove a breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment would to be if he argued constructive evicition. Linda can aruge against that claim that he did not vacate the premises and the construction works are not substantially interferring with the use of his that $100 was not enough for the amount of customers and business he had lost due to her construction. However, Linda could aruge that she was only legally oblgiated to give 2000 swaure feet of the floor area with a common right of access, a common use of the parking lotm and one designated parking spot. So since her worker's equipment were only the line alittle of his designated area she compensated of it. It is likely that Peter's only way to prove a breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment would to be if he argued constructive evicition. Linda can aruge against that claim that he did not vacate the premises and the construction works are not substantially interferring with the use of his spsace. Another weakness to Peter's argument is that the construction workers interferance is not permenant. Although it is lasting longer then expected, it will eventually come to an end. Although the flooding in the Reste Realty case was not permenat it was so substantial that it was enough to be considered a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. If the construction work is unreasonable loud or interferring directly with the operation of the pizza resturant then maybe Peter would have a stronger claim. However, since the only problem is that it is loud and he has to keep his window closed so dust does not come in it is unlikely that the courts will find this to be a breach of the covernant of quiet enjoyment. The court will likely rule similar to they did in the Echo Consulting case by not finding a constructive eviction but granting damages, potentially in the this case for the unforseeable length of interference by the construction worker.

375b7cda-8003-4b56-b78a-350779c69156," Question 1: In Dana's conveyance to Eve she creates a Fee Simple Determinable. This is a fee simple determinable because of the durational language that is in the conveyance. The duration language is ""so long as"" other durational language for example are ""during"" and ""while"" this durational language creates a Fee Simple Determinable.In a Fee Simple Determinable the grantor has the Possibility or Reverter, so in this fact pattern if Dana is to violate the determinable language which is attempting to sell the house, then the property would automatically revert to Dana. This also could be a Fee Simple Subject to Condition subsequent because of the language ""provided that"" which is often found in Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent Conveyances. In A Fee Simple Subject to condition Subsequent the original grantor has either the right of entry or power of termination in the property. Arguments for Eve to be permitted to solict other offers for the sale of Blackacre, would likley lean on the rules of contruction. In White v Brown the conveyance stated that the house not be sold, the court ruled that the according to the Rules of Construction, Fee Simple Absolute is preferred over a life estate and that despite the language the court found that FSA was intended. If Eve was able to prove she had a Fee Simple Absolute from the conveyance rather than a Fee Simple Determinable, then Eve would be permitted to solict other offers for the sale of Blackacre. The rules of construction also push for the free alienabilty of land, which would mean that Eve would have the ability to sell the land at any point to whomever she desired.The rules of construction also promote a Fee Simple Subject to condition subsequent over a Fee Simple Determinable. The Fee Simple Subject to condition subsquent, would also force Fiona if included in personal property in Dana's will includes all estates, to enter the property in order to regain possession. A strong argument for Eve to sell the property would be to cite the Baker v Weedon case. In Baker v Weedon a farm land, Weedon attempted to sell the property as she no longer was using the property, creating affirmative waste which is discouraged and she needed money to live off. The Farm was soon going to be bought by the government and the price was going to substantially rise.The court found that selling the farm then would be economic waste as the value would substantially increase in the near future and selling it would hurt the future intrests.The fact pattern here follows in that the house is in a A strong argument for Eve to sell the property would be to cite the Baker v Weedon case. In Baker v Weedon a farm land, Weedon attempted to sell the property as she no longer was using the property, creating affirmative waste which is discouraged and she needed money to live off. The Farm was soon going to be bought by the government and the price was going to substantially rise.The court found that selling the farm then would be economic waste as the value would substantially increase in the near future and selling it would hurt the future intrests.The fact pattern here follows in that the house is in a prime location for New Suffolk and has substantially increased in value. Not searching for offers now on the property would according to Baker v Weedon be doing a economic disservice and potentially creating economic waste which the court discourages. Additionally in Baker v Weedon, the court values the future intrest of all parties in making a decision, so following Dana's will, Fiona would be the future party and Eve would be required to create a trust with Fiona so that her future intrest is recognized. In regards to Fiona,from Dana's will Fiona holds in FSA in all of Dana's personal property and which is most likley according to the laws of New Suffolk in where if the property is not distrubted according to a will or another instrument it should first be distributed to isse Fiona receiving the house and intrest in the house after Dana passes away as there is no conveyance as to where the house will go after Dana. Following that reasoning after Dana's death, Fiona will hold either the Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent, or Fee Simple Determinable over the property that was conveyed to Eve. Fioan's best claim to reclaiming ownership would be the Fee Simple Determinable. Similar to Marenholz where the son after the parents death held a Fee Simple Determinable on the property that his parents granted to the school. The court ruled, that immediatley after the property was no longer being used for the school it automatically reverted to the son. Fiona can use that reasoning that as soon as Eve started soliciting offers it automatically reverted back to Dana. Fiona also can halt the sale of Blackacre, based off the ruling in Arkland v Harper. In Arkland, one company was attempting a partition in sale over a partition in kind due to the great ecomonic benefits that would occur from a parition in sale. The court in this case ruled, that they do not make decisions based off only economic benefits but also off other factors such as emotional ties. This connects to this fact pattern here as while selling the house would have great economic benefits, Fiona still has an attachment to the house as she lived there with her deceased mother until she had left for college. This emotional tie may assist in preventing the potential sale of the house by Eve. Fioan can also cite the dissenting opinion in White v Brown (as Eve cited the concurring), spekaing on the Rule of Construction that the court should look at the intent of the grantor in making a decision. In a two sentence conveyance written by Dana, Dana mentions that Eve may neither sell the house nor fact pattern here as while selling the house would have great economic benefits, Fiona still has an attachment to the house as she lived there with her deceased mother until she had left for college. This emotional tie may assist in preventing the potential sale of the house by Eve. Fioan can also cite the dissenting opinion in White v Brown (as Eve cited the concurring), spekaing on the Rule of Construction that the court should look at the intent of the grantor in making a decision. In a two sentence conveyance written by Dana, Dana mentions that Eve may neither sell the house nor attempt to sell the house. Fiona can state that it is clear in this intent that Dana did not want the house to be sold. For holding Eve accountable for the repairs needed on Blackacre as Fioan is the future intrest, she can find that Eve exercised in both permissive and affirmative waste. Permissive waste in the manner that Eve left the house untended too and neglected it and affirmative waste in that Eve even after returing to see the house in shambles did not hire somone to fix the house. Eve may counter this is saying that she was not permissive in the fact that she set up Auto-Pay annually for the real estate taxes on the property. "," Question 2: In order for Peter to abandon his lease and not be held liable for it he will need to prove that there was a Breach of the covenant of Quiet Enjoyment. Under the Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Eviction lies, Partial Actual Eviction, Constructive Eviction and Damages, For Partial Actual Eviction, Peter needs to find that his enjoyment of the land was violated and he was not given acess to the totalitity of his land. In the case where the brother rented out the property and gave it to his sister, she built a wall that was encroaching on the property of the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed that this was partial actual eviction because when you sign a lease you are entilted to the full enjoyment of this lease. The court found based off the common law that prevention for enjoying some of the property is prevention of enjoyment for all of the property. This fact pattern follows that case in the way that the contractor built scaffolding all across the rear of the building, largely blocking acess to the rear door. While the rear door was only used for a small amount of Peter's Pizzas customers it was used for the Pizza deliveries and the scaffolding prevented Peter from enjoying it. Additionaly Peter is promised one designated parking spot and with the equipment going over ""the white line"" that defines his designated and guarenteed parking space, Peter is not getting the full enjoyment of his leese. Peter can use these to claim that he was partially actually evicted from the place. of the property is prevention of enjoyment for all of the property.

Peter can use these to claim that he was partially actually evicted from the place. Linda can counter it as in the lease she only provided Peter with a common right of acess thereto, which she can claim was only one door and not both the front and the back door. Linda can also contest the finding found in the wall case, as common law would say that evicition from part of the property is eviction from all the property, the modern law states different.Peter was prevented from using his whole parking space as well, so in order to counter the partial actual eviction Linda can reference the modern law, where it says that if evicted from part of the property, then rent should be lowered or renogatiated based on the new property. Linda does this as she deducts $100 from his monthly rent. With the back entrence being closed and difficult to enter, Peter can look to Echo Consulting v North Conway Bank in attempting to find damages. When North Conway did renovations, despite it not being intentional, they prevented Echo from using their back door. The prevention of using the back door was found to not be partial actual eviction or constructive eviction but Echo was compensated for damages. In order to find Constructive Eviction, Peter needs to prove that there was a substantial interference with his enjoyment of the property, that he gave notice and appropriate time for it to remedied and that he left the property. Often times a substantial interference is an interference that needs to be permanent but from Reste we learned that it does not. Every time that that it rained the rain, the rain would leak down into the Reste. Peter should try to prove that the innability to open the windows his windows due to the dust and the noise is substantially interfeering with his enjoyment of the property and that he notified Linda of it. In addition to the unability to open the windows, a huge part of the industry of a Pizza Company is the ability to deliver Pizza's. Due to the construction in order to carry Pizza's, Peter and his employees would need to navigate through a ""maze of scaffolding"" in order to get to the car and deliver pizzas. Thus his staff is having great difficulty making on time deliveries and leading to a loss of profit for Peter. This leads to what is Peters strongest claim of constructive eviction. The inability to make deliveries on time or make the place attractive to customers due to the ""loud noise"" and ""dust"" are a substantial interference with Peter's enjoyment of the property. Peter gave notice and following Reste, he gave the Linda a reasonable amount of time to end the construction. He left for a week to go on ability to deliver Pizza's.

Peter gave notice and following Reste, he gave the Linda a reasonable amount of time to end the construction. He left for a week to go on vacation but weeks turned into months and no longer was the time of construction reasonable. The final thing Peter must do to claim constructive eviction is leave the premises. If he does that he can claim constructive eviction. If Peter's constructive eviction claim is denied by the court, following Sommer v Kridel, Linda has a duty to mitigate damages and seek another tenant. Linda will counter this claim, in that she was promt in responding to his complaints and told him that it will be resolved. Linda will also claim that this was just a temporary thing where in Reste, rain is something that will continue to occur and construction has a predictable or eventual end date. While this may be a stretch Peter can attempt to cite Hilder, despite this not being a housing case, due to the dust and Noise, his customers cannot gather there and using implied warranty of habitability it is not safe for them to be there.

fad9d7b4-6245-4e76-ae50-76d00c933b26," Issue: The first issue we need to discuss are what future interest were conveyed to Eve at the time of the conveyance and what interest did Dana retain at the time of her conveyance too. Rule: The rule is that as the grantor, Dana is giving away her right of fee simple absolute owenrship to Eve when she conveys the interest to Eve. Fee simple absolute ownership is the total owenrship interest of an estate or land. However, the conveyance to Eve has a condition and therefore the interest is no longer in fee simple absolute when it is conveyed to Eve. Eve now has a future interest that is conditional based on durational language which means that upon the occurance of the condition the estate will revert back to the original grantor. While Dana is alive she is still the grantor but since Eve is thinking of selling the estate, then it can revert back to Dana's estate executor who is in charge of her estate business. The possible interests are the free hold estates known as the present interests which are the fee simple absolute, and life estate. Along with the fee simple absolute there is the fee simple defeasible interests which are the fee simple determinable, the fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and the fee simple subject to executory interest. The fee simple deterinable has the possibility of reverter for the original grantor and the fee simple subject to condition subsequent has the right of entry but that must be used by the actual grantor when possible to be effective. Then there are the future interest which are divided by remainders and exectutory interest. The possible future remainders are the vested and contingent remainder. Under the vested remainder we have the indefeasibly vested remainder, the vested remainder in open class, and the vested remainder subject to divestment. Analysis: It is difficult to know what Dana meant when she was conveying the estate's interest because ""provided that"" is a conditional term and since Eve is getting the estate in the present time of the conveyance from Dana because she is moving, this language would considered a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. It is not a contingent remiander because in order to be that the interest must be in the conditional terms of future interest that is yet to be conveyed or the person must be unascertained. However, we know that Eve is a real person who will receieve the interest. The reason this language is an ambiguous conveyance is because it also says ""so long 7 as"", which is language of the durational nature interpreting a fee simple determinable. Now we must decide which type of interest Dana meant by this conveyance language. You could also argue that Eve has a vested remainder because she is an conveyance from Dana because she is moving, this language would considered a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. It is not a contingent remiander because in order to be that the interest must be in the conditional terms of future interest that is yet to be conveyed or the person must be unascertained. However, we know that Eve is a real person who will receieve the interest. The reason this language is an ambiguous conveyance is because it also says ""so long as"", which is language of the durational nature interpreting a fee simple determinable. Now we must decide which type of interest Dana meant by this conveyance language. You could also argue that Eve has a vested remainder because she is an ascertained person, you might say but this is based on conditional language, I would argue that the conditional language only matters once she receieves the estate therefore at the time of the covneyance being written it was a vested remainder given to Eve in either FSSCS or FSD. We know that the courts tend to favor the FSSCS over the FSD in the occasion of an ambiguous conveyance. Although, in the Marenholtz case we saw the court say that when it is difficult to determine what the original grantor wanted and there is a possibility for the grantor to get the land back. The court said that it would favor a FSD so that the grantor could have the possibility of reverter if the grantee broke the condition of that conveyance. We also know from the White v. Brown case that courts tend to favor estates in fee simple absolute so if Eve does break the conditional conveyance then the original grantor or in this case the person in charge of Dana's estate will have the estate in fee simple absolute. Conclusion: A court is likely to find that if the person in charge of Dana's estate does not know about the possibility of the conveyance being broken then it should be considered an FSD as to automatically renew back to them. If Fiona is aware of the conveyance then the court will use the FSSCS over the FSD in most cases. Issue: The next issue is whether Eve can sell the land even though the conveyance strictly says the land cannot be sold. Rule: There is the argument of waste. In this situation Eve could argue for Ameriolate waste. Analysis: By this argument Eve could say that since the property has appreciated in value so much more than was expected it of the properties best interest to be sold. That is because if it is sold to someone who has such interest in the property to pay so much for it then they must have plans to use it and make it more valuable then it was before. Plus Eve doesn't want it anymore and it is going to waste without anyone using it anyway. We can compare Ameriolate waste to the barn case we read but that was when Rule: There is the argument of waste. In this situation Eve could argue for Ameriolate waste. Analysis: By this argument Eve could say that since the property has appreciated in value so much more than was expected it of the properties best interest to be sold. That is because if it is sold to someone who has such interest in the property to pay so much for it then they must have plans to use it and make it more valuable then it was before. Plus Eve doesn't want it anymore and it is going to waste without anyone using it anyway. We can compare Ameriolate waste to the barn case we read but that was when the party in question actually made the barn better through renovations. Eve could argue that she is just trying to put the property in a better situation like in the Barn case. Conclusion: This would be a tough argument because Eve never actually did anything herself to make the property more valuable but she could argue that by selling it she has made it's value much higher and that there will be more renovations likely done by the buyer. She could also secretly sell the property and not tell Fiona and argue that the interest was a FSSCS so that Fiona would need to actually come and re-enter the property to re-take which she may never know to do. Issue: Can Fiona reclaim ownership of Blackacre and hold Eve accontable for her waste of the property? Rule: Accroding to the conveyances as described above we know that Fiona can reclaim the property once it is sold based on whether it is an FSD or FSSCS. She can also argue for waste. Analysis: Fiona can retake the property because the conveyance litterally says it cannot be sold thus if Eve does sell it she can argue that it should go back to her either through FSD and the right of reverter or FSSCS and the right of entry. For waste, Fiona can argue that Eve was affrimatively wasting the property because Eve knew that by leaving the place alone and no one taking care of it that it would start to fall apart. Affirmative waste is when the owner of the property knows they are causing the land to fall apart and potentially lose value. Fiona could also argue that Eve was permissively wasting the proeprty because she neglected to take care of it and even if she did not know she was causing the property to go to waste it still happened when Fiona came and saw the state of Blackacre. If we look at the Baker case we know that courts tend to be even when handing out decisions on these things, but this would fall under permissive waste and Eve could have done something but chose potentially lose value. Fiona could also argue that Eve was permissively wasting the proeprty because she neglected to take care of it and even if she did not know she was causing the property to go to waste it still happened when Fiona came and saw the state of Blackacre. If we look at the Baker case we know that courts tend to be even when handing out decisions on these things, but this would fall under permissive waste and Eve could have done something but chose not to. Unlike in that case when the old lady mostly was too old to work or pay taxes thus the court felt bad for her and split the damages. Conclusion: Fiona would most likely win in court for Eve's waste of Blackacre and the fact that she has the right of reverter or if the court looks at the interest as a FSSCS then she just needs to know about the sale and then she will likely re-enter and take back Blackacre. "," I: Can Peter argue for a breach of his right to the covenant of quiet enjoyment? R: In order to breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment a landlord must interfere with tenants rights to live peacefully on the leased land. A: The arguments for the CQE are 1) actual/partial eviction 2) constructive eviction. In order for Peter to argue for actual/partial eviction he could say that the encroachment of the construction equipment on his leased property serves as a partial eviction which gives him the right to argue for a breach in the CQE since all you need is for the landlord to break one of the two options I listed out in the first sentence. As we saw in the wall case we read the court stated that even though the tenants land was only partially being encroached by a wall that the landlord let someone build on the tenants leased land. Any partial eviction is equal to a total eviction of the leased property thus becoming an actual eviction. However, there is also the counter-argument that this was not the landlords doing and that Peter would have to take that issue up with the construction company or at least allow the landlord time to try and fix the problem. I would say that an argument for constructive eviction is possible too but a bit harder. In order to be able to constructively evict one's self from their lease the following must happen. 1) The landlord must have interfered with the tenants rights, 2) the interference must have been substantial, 3) the tenant must have notified the landlord or the landlord should have known, 4) and the tenant must actually vacate the premises and lease. Peter could argue that by the loud noise, dust, blocking of the rear door, loss of business all caused an interference to his rights as a tenant and that should suffice for 1), 2), 3) since he the problem.

Like in the flooding case we read we know that if something substantial happens and meets these requirements for constuctive eviction. However, this could also not work because even though the requirements for CQE could be argued for if we look at the Echo case the court was very clear that some interferences are not enough to meet the right for constructive eviction. That case talked about a similar set of facts where the tenants argued that construction ordered by the landlord caused a lot of dirt and noise and also blocked the main doorways for their business. But the court said the tenants could still access one of the doors and the other facts were just not enough. For Peter's employees although it is inconvenient it seems like they can still use a door to get to the parking lot. The court would also possibly look at the fact that even though Peter told the landlord she made a concerted effort to try to fix the issues by telling him the construction was not supposed to take this long and even offers to deduct some of his rent. C: Peter could argue that he should not have to pay the rest of the rent but it depends on how extreme the court will see these circumstances. His argument for actual eviction might be better. I: The issue is whether Peter has any legal rights to break his lease? R: Peter could argue for the implied warranty of habitable. This is the expectation that a landlord must keep the leased property in good enough condition for human habitability of a tenant. Good evidence of a breach of the IWH is a failure by the landlord to keep up with the standard housing codes of this jurisdiction. The tenant can either withhold rent or sue for damages and does not need to actually vacate the property in a breach of IWH. A: Peter could argue that he could not run a business under these circumstances. Like in the Hilder case where there was just too much broken glass and things in the way to live properly, he could not make R: Peter could argue for the implied warranty of habitable.

A: Peter could argue that he could not run a business under these circumstances. Like in the Hilder case where there was just too much broken glass and things in the way to live properly, he could not make money and it was evident that he was losing customers. Peter could try to dig up the housing codes for his jurisdiction and find out whether any of them were violated by the construction and encroachments to bolster his case. Although it would be hard to argue this too because if he just closes the windows then people can still occupy the pizza store without any habitable issues that don't make it tenanble or livable. C: A court will likely find that the breach of IWH is hard to argue for Peter beacuse nothing inside his leased property is unhabitable. But if he can find significant housing code violations then maybe. ",1620,1047
dd43e8b2-0009-4818-9504-a61c8c9a0034," The issue is that at the time of the conveyance, Eve's interest in the property are ambiguous. Dana's language used creates either a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) or a fee simple determinable (FSD). The future interest that Dana's estate has in Blackacre is dependent on the conveyance to Eve. If Eve has Blackacre in a FSSCS, then the future interest of the estate is a right of entry, which means that the estate would have to assert that right if the condition is ever breached.If Eve has Blackacre in FSD, then the future interest of the estate is a possibility of reverter, which means that the estate would take ownership automatically when the condition is breached. The rules of construction are used in situations of ambiguous conveyances. In White v. Brown, it was established that the court favors a fee simple absolute (FSA) and want to achieve the intent of the grantor in ambiguous conveyances. Here, it is clear that Dana did not want Eve to attempt to sell the property, as she states that Blackacre would go to Eve ""provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house. The house is not to be sold."" In this case, Dana conveyed the land to Eve on the condition that she never attempt to sell the home. Typically courts will favor a FSSCS over an FSD, as the rules of construction state, and here Dana intended for Eve to have Blackacre provided that she did not attempt to sell. If the court were to hold that the conveyance was created in a FSSCS, Dana's estate would have a right of entry which would require that they assert their right of entry when the condition is broken. In Marhenholz v. County School Board, it was determined that the School Board held the land in an FSD and the Marhenholz had a possibility of reverter which was automatic upon the breach. If the court held that Dana's conveyance to Eve was in FSD, Dana's estate would have ownership of the land automatically when Eve attempts to sell the property. However, the Marhenholz case was distinguished as it did not follow the typical trend of the rules of construction, which is to favor an FSSCS over an FSD. Additionally, at the time of the conveyance, Fiona had no interest in the property and only inherited Dana's personal property at Dana's death. It is not2clear who is the administrator of Dana's estate at the time of her death. However, it could be argued that Fiona, as Dana's only issue, assumed the role of the adminstrator of the estate upon Dana's death because it was not stated in her will and property of a automatically when Eve attempts to sell the property. However, the Marhenholz case was distinguished as it did not follow the typical trend of the rules of construction, which is to favor an FSSCS over an FSD. Additionally, at the time of the conveyance, Fiona had no interest in the property and only inherited Dana's personal property at Dana's death. It is not clear who is the administrator of Dana's estate at the time of her death. However, it could be argued that Fiona, as Dana's only issue, assumed the role of the adminstrator of the estate upon Dana's death because it was not stated in her will and property of a deceased person is first distributed to issue. As the adminstrator of the estate, Fiona could assert her right of entry or possibility of reverter against Eve when Eve began to wonder how much the property could sell for. Dependent on the conveyance to Eve from Dana, Fiona, as the administrator, would either have to assert her right of entry, if it was an FSSCS, or would automatically take possession of Blackacre through her future interest of possibility of reverter. As a future interest holder, Fiona could make a claim of waste against Dana. The law of waste essentially provides that future interest holders get the property in the same condition as it was originally conveyed. Permissive waste is when the present interest holder voluntary omits to care for the property and it leads to damage. Here, Eve moved to Florida and when both Eve and Fiona return 5 years later, they find the home in disray with broken glass, roof shingles missing, and other serious problems. Eve, having been the present interest holder, moved to Florida and negelected to care for the property leading to its damage. As a future interest holder, Fiona could make the argument that Eve failed to upkeep the property and therefore caused waste. The law of waste allows future interest holders to bring action against present interest holders when there is waste created. Additionally, Fiona may rely on Baker v. Weedon, where the court held that economic value is not the sole test for economic waste. The court should also look to sentimental value and longstanding ownership. Fiona's sentimental value to the property may be used to determine that despite the value of the property, waste was created because her childhood home was no longer in liveable condition. If such an action is brought against Eve, she may make a claim similar to that in Woodrick v. Wood. In that case, a barn was to be removed from a property, a change which would increase the property value, also known as ameliorative waste. The court held that the removal of the barn was not waste because it increased the property value and the barn held no sentimental value to the plaintiff. Even may rely on this to make a claim that despite the lack of care to the property over the 5 years, the property value is staggering because of the house's location in New Suffolk. It may be argued that by Eve accepting the phone call and considering other offers for the sale of Blackacre, she broke the condition set forth in Dana's conveyance of Blackacre to Eve. Again, this falls that case, a barn was to be removed from a property, a change which would increase the property value, also known as ameliorative waste. The court held that the removal of the barn was not waste because it increased the property value and the barn held no sentimental value to the plaintiff. Even may rely on this to make a claim that despite the lack of care to the property over the 5 years, the property value is staggering because of the house's location in New Suffolk. It may be argued that by Eve accepting the phone call and considering other offers for the sale of Blackacre, she broke the condition set forth in Dana's conveyance of Blackacre to Eve. Again, this falls onto whether the conveyance made by Dana created an FSSCS or an FSD. If the court were to follow the rules of construction, it is likely that they will hold that the conveyance created an FSSCS with the estate having a right of entry. Here, it is clear that Dana's intent was to keep Blackacre in her family and her conveyance makes clear the Eve was not to attempt to sell the property. Additionally, if the court were to find that Fiona, as Dana's only issue, is the adminstrator of the estate, then Fiona would have to assert the right of entry once Eve breaks the condition. If Eve has any argument for being permitted the solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre, they would likely be unsuccessful because based on the conveyance, Eve does not hold the land in FSA. If the court were to hold that Eve held the land in FSSCS and Dana's estate had a future interest in the right of entry, it would satisfy the intent of the grantor and also favor FSSCS over FSD, as stated in the rules of construction. In this ambiguous conveyance, following the rules of construction would promote certainty and fairness. "," The issue is whether the implied convenant of quiet enjoyment was breached when the construction to Linda's commerical building took a significant amount more time than originally stated. The convenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) is implied in both commerical and residential leases. At common law, the tenant had full responsibility for the property they were leasing under the doctrine caveat lessee. However, with modern times, the landlord now bears most of the responsbility because of their assumed greater knowledge on the building and their access to resources to fix damages. In Echo Consulting v. North Conway Bank, Echo was barred from accessing the building through a door that had always been used by employees. Echo attempted to make a claim for the breach of CQE and the court explained that a breach of CQE can result in: (1) actual eviction, (2) constructive eviction, or (3) damages. In this case, Peter may make a claim that he is being constructively evicted from a part of the property, the access to the backdoor. Peter may also argue that because the construction equipment encroaches onto his designated parking spot, he is being partially evicted from that spot. The of their assumed greater knowledge on the building and their access to resources to fix damages. In Echo Consulting v. North Conway Bank, Echo was barred from accessing the building through a door that had always been used by employees. Echo attempted to make a claim for the breach of CQE and the court explained that a breach of CQE can result in: (1) actual eviction, (2) constructive eviction, or (3) damages. In this case, Peter may make a claim that he is being constructively evicted from a part of the property, the access to the backdoor. Peter may also argue that because the construction equipment encroaches onto his designated parking spot, he is being partially evicted from that spot. The designated parking spot is a part of his lease and if it is found that he was actually evicted from a portion of this spot, he could make a claim similar to that in Smith v. McEnany. In Smith v. McEnany, where a brick wall prevented the tenants from using a portion of the land they leased, the court held that a partial eviction equates to being evicted from the entirety of the property and a tenant may abate the entirety of their rent as a result of this. The court's decision in Smith contrasts that of the Restatement of Property, which emphasizes equity and believes that if a tenant is partially evicted they should bate the equal percentage of rent. However, Peter may make a claim that by being barred fro accessing his parking spot as stated in lease, he was partially evicted and under the ruling in Smith he is entitled to abatement of his entire rent. If Peter is to make a claim for constructive eviction because of the limited access to the backdoor of the building, he would be required to (1) notify his landlord and give a reasonable time for her to fix the issue and (2) if the issues are not fixed, the tenant must vacate in a reasonable time. This was seen in Reste Realty v. Cooper where basement offices were flooding and the tenant notified the landlord on multiple occassions and when no repairs were done, she vacated the premises and abated her rent. In Reste, it was determined that the tenant vacated in a reasonable amount of time after finding an alternative location and gave the landlord ample time to fix the flooding issue. If Peter wanted to make a claim for constructive eviction he would have to vacate the premise and abate his rent. If Peter chooses to vacate the premises and abate his rent, Linda would have a responsibility to mitigate the damages. In Sommer v. Kridel, the court held that the landlord must put in some reasonable effort to mitigate damages before bringing a claim for the rent against the tenant. In Sommer, the landlord did not attempt to fill the vacancy before bringing a claim against the tenant. Attempting to mitigate the damages can be posting the space in an ad or showing the rental space to another potential tenant. If Peter abates rent and vacates, Linda must attempt to mitigate the damages before bringing a claim against Peter for the rent. Peter's access to the backdoor of the building directly impacts the revenue of his pizza shop. Although Linda has deducted $100 from his monthly rent for the hassle, Peter is no longer enjoying his property mitigate damages before bringing a claim for the rent against the tenant. In Sommer, the landlord did not attempt to fill the vacancy before bringing a claim against the tenant. Attempting to mitigate the damages can be posting the space in an ad or showing the rental space to another potential tenant. If Peter abates rent and vacates, Linda must attempt to mitigate the damages before bringing a claim against Peter for the rent. Peter's access to the backdoor of the building directly impacts the revenue of his pizza shop. Although Linda has deducted $100 from his monthly rent for the hassle, Peter is no longer enjoying his property in quiet enjoyment. He must keep the windows shut because of the dust, and the construction is noisy. Peter's claim for a breach of CQE rests on the barred access to the backdoor which was essential to his business and that his designated parking spot, which is clearly stated in his lease, has been taken over in part by the construction equipment, making his access to that spot much more difficult than it should be. Peter's constant contact with Linda about when the construction will be complete is sufficient to establish that Peter has notified his landlord. Peter has also waited months for the construction to be finished, although it was originally only intended to take a week, and this may signify that he has given Linda a reasaonable amount of time to fix the issues. If he wishes to make a claim for constructive eviction, he must also vacate the premises in a reasonable time. Peter's claims are rationalized by society's interest in what a tenant's expectations are in a lease. Additionally, when there is a breach of CQE, being able to abate rent and bring a claim against the landlord promotes certainty and fairness for tenants. Weaknesses in Peter's claim for constructive eviction and a breach of CQE lie in the terms of his lease. Linda may make the argument that Peter's lease did not state that he would have common right of access to the backdoor of the building which he has been using for deliveries. While, it is accesible by the entire building, Peter's lease allowed him common right of access to the common use parking lot and one designated parking spot. Although the construction is preventing his employees and customers from using the backdoor without hassle, there is still unobstructed entrance to the pizza shop through the front door. This is similar to the argument made in Echo Consulting v. North Conway Bank, as Echo was barred from using one entrance and attempted to make a claim for the breach of CQE. However, the court held that Echo's lease did not entitle them to unobstructed entrance through that entry and they still had access to the building through another door, therefore, there was no constructive eviction and no breach of CQE. Linda may also make the claim that she deducted 6$ 7 from Peter's rent for the hassle of the construction and that construction time is out of her control. She attempted to fix the damages by deducting rent from monthly rent and was aware of the hassle that it was causing Peter and his Echo was barred from using one entrance and attempted to make a claim for the breach of CQE. However, the court held that Echo's lease did not entitle them to unobstructed entrance through that entry and they still had access to the building through another door, therefore, there was no constructive eviction and no breach of CQE. Linda may also make the claim that she deducted $100 from Peter's rent for the hassle of the construction and that construction time is out of her control. She attempted to fix the damages by deducting rent from monthly rent and was aware of the hassle that it was causing Peter and his business. Additionally, Linda may rely on the rule from the Restatement on Property, as seen in Smith v. McEnany, that the only eviction that Peter is experiencing is a partial eviction from his designated parking space and it is a minor partial eviction. Therefore, Linda could make the claim that Peter is not entitled to abate his entire rent, but instead an equal proportion to that of his eviction. This would promote fairness and equity in the situation. Lastly, Linda may make the claim that Peter is not entitled to a claim for breach of CQE and constructive eviction because he has not vacated the premises in a reasonable amount of time. He has waited months and has not vacated the building, which may not be a reasonable time. Peter's claim for CQE is strong if he can prove that he has notified his landlord, given a reasonable time, and if he vacates in a reasonable time. Peter may also be entitled to a equitable relief if he is found to have been actually evicted from a portion of the property in his lease and under the Restatement of Property could abate a portion of his rent. This would promote fairness for both Peter and Linda in this claim. ",1330,1624
e9153b5d-7fee-46ec-88ad-c074ff6699cd," 1. Interests Created by Dana From Dana'es conveyance, it is clear that she wanted to designate the land to Dana. However, Dana uses both ""provided that"" and ""only so long as"" in her conveyance, leaving it rather ambiguous. Thus, the rules of construction must be applied in determining what this conveyance means. It is undisputed the property is given to Eve, but the durational and conditional language proffer arguments for Eve holding a fee simple determinable (FSD) or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS). Moreover, the last line of the conveyance would assume that Dana did not want her house sold under any condition. In White v. Brown, the court dealt with a similar ambiguous conveyance, and ultimately held that when dealing with ambigious conveyances, it is more appropriate to favor a fee simple absolute (FSA) over life estates . They applied the rule of constriction favoring FSA over other estates, as well as the rule favoring the alienability of property. From Dana's language, it is quite clear that Eve did not hold a life estate, sicne there is no langauge indicating such an estate. However, Dana dreamed of permanently moving to Switzerland with the intention to remain their indefinitely. The majority opinion in White v Brown would support Eve holding a fee simple rather than a life estate. Using the dissenting opinion in White v Brown, there is an argument, though surely weak, that Eve's present interest is in a life estate and not in fee simple, since Dana was of clear mind at the time she conveyed her interests and was perfectly capable of conveying a fee simple interest. If Eve were to hold an FSD, Dana's estate would then have a future interest called a possibility of reverter, in which the moment Dana is in violation of the conveyance, the property would automatically revert back to Dana's estate. However, if the court were to rule that Eve were to have a FSSCS, Dana's estate would have a future interest called a right of entry or power of termination, in which Dana's estate would have to affirmatively act in retaking Blackacre were Eve to violate the conveyance. At common law, there is a rule of construction that favors finding FSSCS over FSD. This is because the legal system does not want to promote the forfeiture of2property, even if the tenant of the property were to violate the agreement. Under this rule, Eve has a strong case that she holds a FSSCS. However, Dana's estate would argue that she holds a FSD. Under the Mahrenholz case, the court held that a conveyance revert back to Dana's estate. However, if the court were to rule that Eve were to have a FSSCS, Dana's estate would have a future interest called a right of entry or power of termination, in which Dana's estate would have to affirmatively act in retaking Blackacre were Eve to violate the conveyance. At common law, there is a rule of construction that favors finding FSSCS over FSD. This is because the legal system does not want to promote the forfeiture of property, even if the tenant of the property were to violate the agreement. Under this rule, Eve has a strong case that she holds a FSSCS. However, Dana's estate would argue that she holds a FSD. Under the Mahrenholz case, the court held that a conveyance using the word ""only"" construed a FSD. Being an Illinois case, this was the exception to the long- standing common law rule favoring FSSCS over FSD. Thus, Dana would give more emphasis to the ""only so long as"" language over the ""provided that"" language. Eve Wants to Sell Eve faces the issue of whether she has the ability to judicially sell Blackacre. In accordance with selling the property, the present and future interest holders must be taken into account. As found in Baker v Weedon, a court sitting in equity must take into account the best interests of all parties in determining whether a judicial sale is proper. Here, Eve, being contacted by the real estate agents, has the interest of selling the property for financial gain. Besides this, she does not have any other strong argument to sell the property. She might raise the argument that she could sell under the theory of economic waste, that is, she is unable to use the property in its best and most efficient capacity. However, a court will likely find that she committed waste: failure to exercise ordinary care in maintaining a property). Specifically, she committed permissive waste, that is, her negligence allwoed for the property to go into ruin. Despite this, Eve will argue that she committed ameliorative waste (waste that raises the property value rather than decreasing it). Because the agents identified that the property value spiked rather than plummeted, even though her negligence resulted in the property being in need of much repair beyond that which is normal, such claim will stand strong. In Woodrick v Wood, the Ohio court held that razing a barn, even though the barn held sentimental value to one of the tenants in common, was ok since the razing would raise the property value. Ohio courts had not adopted the common law rule that all waste is bad waste and adopted the doctrine of ameliorative waste. Following this, Eve would have a stronger argument to sell Blackacre. Fiona's Claims to Blackacre and Repairs razing would raise the property value. Ohio courts had not adopted the common law rule that all waste is bad waste and adopted the doctrine of ameliorative waste. Following this, Eve would have a stronger argument to sell Blackacre. Fiona's Claims to Blackacre and Repairs Fiona does not have a strong basis for recliaming ownership of Blackacre. First, when her mother conveyed the property to Eve, she only left Fiona her personal property, not Blackacre. If Fiona were to argue for reclaiming Blackacre, she would have to prove that she in some say, shape, or form was acting on behalf of Dana's estate. Although she is Dana's issue, Dana specifically conveyed the present possessory interest to Eve. However, Fiona could assert that she is acting on behalf of her mother's estate and that if Eve was found to have a FSD, then she would hold a possibility of reverter and there may be an adverse possession claim against Eve. There are five elements in an adverse possession (AP) claim. They are continuous, hostile and under a claim of right, actual, notorious and open, and exclusive. Because Eve leaves the property in 2014, this is when the clock for the statute of limitations would begin. But because New Suffolk's SOL is 10 years, this element has not been met. But there is potential for there to be an AP claim in the future. Eve's departure from Blackacre would spark the hostile element of AP, meaning that Eve would have to have permission from Dana's estate to be hold the property. However, she leaves the property to decay and does not receive permission to hold Blackacre after her abandonment. Because there is an objective standard in New Suffolk, we need not look into Eve's state of mind as to whether she wanted to adversely possess the land. Eve's abandoment would argue directly against her AP claim since she failed to uphold the premises as a true owner would. Being that roof shingles were missing, the windows were cracked, as well as there being other serious problems, she committed permissive waste rather than actually using the property. Because we can assume the home is visible to the naked eye, there is no issue as to whether the home is being used in a notorious fashion. That is, that the true owner of the home have at least construtive notice that the home was being adversely possessed. If all of the above is found true about the conveyance, Eve would be the exclusive adverse possessor of possessors on the property, this would not be the property. Because there is no issue of other adverse an issue of importance. Because we can assume the home is visible to the naked eye, there is no issue as to whether the home is being used in a notorious fashion. That is, that the true owner of the home have at least construtive notice that the home was being adversely possessed. If all of the above is found true about the conveyance, Eve would be the exclusive adverse possessor of the property. Because there is no issue of other adverse possessors on the property, this would not be an issue of importance. Lastly, Fiona, if acting on behalf of her mother's estate, would argue under the case law of Baker v. Weedon that Eve had a duty not to commit waste. As previously stated above, a property owner has a duty not to commit waste. Because Fiona committed permissive waste, and arguably affirmative waste (purposeful waste done to a property) since she meant to abandon the premises, Fiona could argue that Eve is liable for damages. Eve had a duty to not commit waste and did so anyways. Under these facts, Fiona could sue for repairs to the property. "," Peter's Claims As a commercial tenant to a term of years lease, Peter has an obligation to pay his rent to Linda. Peter also has an obligation to not commit waste or abandon the premises during this period of time, as well as other specifications required by his lease. Because waste and other specifications are not mentioned, they are not at issue here. Even though Peter does not want to leave since he might be found liable to pay rent, he has strong claims that protect him as a tenant. As a commercial tenant, he ahs the option to argue that Linda breached his covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) or his implied warranty of habitability (IWH). IWH is stricter and only deals with residential leases so this doctrine does not apply here. To successfully bow out of his lease aggrement, Peter can assert that he was partially or actually evicted (PAE), constructively evicted (CE) or he can sue for damages for his loss of profits. To assert a PAE claim, he must prove that Linda partially evicted him from his premises or actually evicted him from the entirety. He is still in his shop so he has not been actually evicted, but he can argue that he has been partially evicted based on the parking spot encroachment and the scaffolding that hinders access to the rear door. Under Smith v McEnany, a tenant's premises were cut off due to a brick wall being built in the yard. The court held that a tenant who has been partially evicted was no longer liable to pay rent since the rent being paid covered enjoyment of the entirety of the premises. In constructively evicted (CE) or he can sue for damages for his loss of profits. To assert a PAE claim, he must prove that Linda partially evicted him from his premises or actually evicted him from the entirety. He is still in his shop so he has not been actually evicted, but he can argue that he has been partially evicted based on the parking spot encroachment and the scaffolding that hinders access to the rear door. Under Smith v McEnany, a tenant's premises were cut off due to a brick wall being built in the yard. The court held that a tenant who has been partially evicted was no longer liable to pay rent since the rent being paid covered enjoyment of the entirety of the premises. In that case, the landlord had a duty to honor the CQE which they ultimately did not do. The landlord's duty to honor the CQE is still in place today. Furthermore, these facts analogize well to the Echo case, where a consulting firm asserted a breach of CQE against the landlord for renovations occurring in the same building. In this case, the business parking lot was blocked off, the rear entrance was closed off, and the noise coming from the renovations was so loud that the firm could not conduct business as usual. The court held that the PAE claim was not strong enough to break the lease since they still had access to the building, regardless of whether the lease entitled them to parking in the lot. Morevoer, even though the rear entrance was blocked, they still had access through another door. And, the noise did not actually evict the firm from the premises. Here, Peter can still park in his spot since the encroachment is slightly over the the white line and does not really hinder his access to his parking spot. The holding in Echo furthers this finding. Next, Peter would argue that the scaffolding in the rear hinders his access, as well as his employees and potential customers, to the pizza shop since they do not want to go through the hassle of navigating through the construction. However, since there is evidence that it is still possible to acquire access to the shop, his PAE claim is not strong enough to warrant his breaking of the lease. Again, like in Echo and distinct from McEnany, Peter and others still have the ability to access the premises. Thus, this claim would not hold in court. Peter's strongest claim lies in asserting a constructive eviction (CE) claim. To do this, the tenant must notify the landlord of the breaches, the breaches must be substantial enough to warrant action, the landlord must be given reasonable time to fix the issues, and then the tenant must abandon after a reasonable time. Peter's facts directly analogize to the Echo case as stated above. Echo asserted a CE claim against the bank, stating that it was as if they were being convicted since they could not lease. beneficially enjoy the premises as designated by their 7 However, the court held that their CE claim was not sufficient since they failed to abandon the premises. notify the landlord of the breaches, the breaches must be substantial enough to warrant action, the landlord must be given reasonable time to fix the issues, and then the tenant must abandon after a reasonable time. Peter's facts directly analogize to the Echo case as stated above. Echo asserted a CE claim against the bank, stating that it was as if they were being convicted since they could not beneficially enjoy the premises as designated by their lease. However, the court held that their CE claim was not sufficient since they failed to abandon the premises. Here, Peter can make a strong CE assertion. Peter maanged to express his concerns to Linda about the issues he was facing. Moreover, those issues were substantial to the success of his business (backdoor helpful to customers entering, employees making quick deliveries, failure to ventilate the shop because of massive amounts of dust). Linda told Peter to be patient but the repairs that should have only taken a week turned to months. A court could find that Linda was given more than enough time to finish the repairs. Moreover, Peter's calls every week strengthen his claim that Linda was notified of the issues. As Peter's counsel, I would advise Peter to leave the premises if he could proffer evidence in court that his business suffered significant losses. That way, his constructive eviction claim would be complete. Peter's last option is to sue for damages. If he cannot successfully assert either a PAE or CE claim, he can renegotiate his rent and create new terms under the lease. However, since Linda decided to drop the rent by $100, she will assert that she adequately compensated Peter for the breach of their CQE and is not required to renegotiate the rent per their agreement. On the other hand, Peter has plenty of evidence to lower his rent. In the persuasive landlord-tenant cases in New Suffolk, all of them agree that, due to modern society's complexities and the sheer interconnectivity that people have with one another, the landlord has a heavier burden in providing for tenants she leases property to. As a landlord, Linda bears the heavy burden of providing for Peter. Peter's business has suffered tremendously at the hands of the ongoing renovations. Beyond his loss in profits, Peter's troubles of navigating through the construction further a finding that Peter's rent should be lowered. ",1533,1206
ef5e07b6-ab79-4558-880e-90df1e36afd2," At the time of the conveyance, Eve's interest would most likely be seen as a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS). The conveyance Dana made could be seen as ambigious, as it used language that is commonly used in a FSSCS and language used in a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD). FSDs use durational language, just like the phrase ""only so long"" that Dana used. And FSSCSs commonly used another phrase that Dana used, ""provided that"". When the wording of a conveyance is ambigious and can be seen as more than one conveyance, just like in White v. Brown where the court could not determine if it was a Fee Simple Absolute (FSA) or a life estate from the wording of the conveyance, they looked to the rules of construction to fit the conveyance into one category. The relevant rule of construction in this case would be one recongnized in the Marenholz case, where a FSSCS is preferred over a FSD. This is because the future interest in a FSSCS is not automatic on the breaking of the condition, and the courts prefer this as it requires an affirmative act. So applying this rule of construction, the courts would prefer a FSSCS, where any future interest would have to bring suit to regain Blackacre. The future interest of a FSSCS is the right of entry or power of termination, and at the time of conveyance Dana would have had the right or entry or power of termination. Fiona would have had no interest in Blackacre at all. After Dana's death this would change. Eve would still have a FSSCS for above reasons, but Fiona would inherit her mother's interest in the property most likely. This is because Dana never specified who got her future interests in her will or other instrument, but future interests are still inheritable intestate. And if property of a deceased person is not distributed according to will, then the first in line to inherit would be Dana's issue, then ancestors then collateral. Since Fiona is Dana's daughter, she is first in line to inherit as issue, and Eve would be after her as cousins are part of collateral and Dana's parents (ancestors) are deceased. With Fiona inheriting Dana's interest, she would now have the right of entry or power of termination over Blackacre. Eve could make the argument that the conveyance was a FSA with a restraint versus a FSSCS or FSD, in order to say that she has the right to sell the property as there can be no restraints of FSA. In the White v. Brown case, the conveyance was seen as5a FSA with a restraint on alienabilty. The court's holding shows that while it may seem like a life estate due to there being a restraint, as FSA cannot have them, the restraint was not a determining factor in what the conveyance actually was. So similarly in this (ancestors) are deceased. With Fiona inheriting Dana's interest, she would now have the right of entry or power of termination over Blackacre. Eve could make the argument that the conveyance was a FSA with a restraint versus a FSSCS or FSD, in order to say that she has the right to sell the property as there can be no restraints of FSA. In the White v. Brown case, the conveyance was seen as a FSA with a restraint on alienabilty. The court's holding shows that while it may seem like a life estate due to there being a restraint, as FSA cannot have them, the restraint was not a determining factor in what the conveyance actually was. So similarly in this case, since the condition is a restraint on alienability, the court might hold that it was a FSA since that is preferred, and also in the rules of construction the court prefers free alienability. Also, the dissent in the case looks at the intent of the grantor and the whole document. In White the dissent noted that she perfectly conveyed other parts of her will, and so her ability and intent was clear from the conveyance of the property in question. So looking to the intent in this case, Dana was intending to keep the property in the family, but trying to limit the right of alienability. Even if it is seen as a FSSCS with a restraint on alienability, it is a disabling restraint and a majority of courts do not allow for these types of restraints, and hold them to be null. So, if a court found that the restraint was null, Eve would be free to solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre. As a future interest holder in Blackacre, if Eve was allowing the property to deterioate, Fiona could potentially bring suit against Eve for waste. When Eve left the property to go elsewhere, the property began to degrade from the lack of upkeep, which is descripitve of permissive waste. The theory of waste is to protect the rights of the future interest holders. In the highway case, the court held that while the interests of the present interest holder is important, the interests of the remaindermen must also be considered. So since the property was left alone and not being taken care of, the interest that Fiona had in the property was being harmed, and she should be able to bring action against Eve. As for reclaiming interest of Blackacre, Fiona has a pretty strong case. The condition set forth by Dana's conveyance was that ""Eve does not attempt to sell the house"". So if the court sees the facts that Eve recieved an offer, and was curious to other offers, as an attempt to sell, Fiona could bring suit to recover Blackacre from Eve. Also as one of the rules of construction, the intent of the grantor must be considered. Since Dana wanted the property to stay in the family, Eve thinking about selling the property goes directly against this. "," When there is a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (BCQE), like in this case, there are three things that could occur: actual eviction, partial eviction, and damages, as seen from the Echo case. Actual eviction is likely not to be found from the common spaces of the lease being rendered unusable by the construction. In Echo, the tenant's were not seen to be actually evicted due to the fact that the common spaces they used were no longer usuable during the construction. The door they prefered and the parking lot were not able to be used during the construction, but the court found that common spaces in a lease are not the same as the actual leased premise in actual evictions. This is because the spaces that were not common, were still accessible and able to be used normally. So Peters access to the back door, and parking lot, will likely not be seen as an actual eviction, as he could still enter his business and conduct business normally withing. But the designated parking spot that Peter had was not shared with anyone else, and therefore not a common space. There is pretty strong evidence that there was an actual eviction due to the encroachment of Peter's parking spot. As seen in Smith v. McEnany, an encroachment, no matter how small the actual interference was, was an partial eviciton. In Smith, since the tenant had signed the lease for the whole property listed, the partial eviction counted as an actual eviction. There was a physical encroachment in this case because as the construction continued some of the equipment echroached on Peter designated spot from the lease. So the same is true here, even though the encroachment was small, the intereference does not matter because Peter was being deprived of at least some part of the property he had in the lease.Linda would probaly raise that she provided the common approach to remedy this is by lowering the rent, so when she offered $100 deduction of the lease, this weakend Peter's claim to an actual eviction as the remedy was already applied. As for constructive eviction, Peter's argument is pretty weak. In Echo, there was a very similar fact pattern. There were common spaces included in the lease, like in Peter's lease, where construction was occuring. This is included an entrance, that was no longer usuable, and a parking lot. The court found that these would not be included in the constructive eviction claim, because although maybe more tedious to gain access, the tenant's still had access to use their facilities as they wanted or needed. The same is true in this case, although more tedious, the use of the pizzeria remained the same throughout As for constructive eviction, Peter's argument is pretty weak. In Echo, there was a very similar fact pattern. There were common spaces included in the lease, like in Peter's lease, where construction was occuring.

The same is true in this case, although more tedious, the use of the pizzeria remained the same throughout the construction. So, the interference was not apart of the premises Peter held alone and were not substaintial enough to render his use and enjoyment of the property void. While the construction went on for longer than expected, Linda will probably point out that it is not permanent, which is an essential element to the BCQE as seen in Reaste Realty. In Reaste Realty, the landlord argued that the breach must be permanent, in order to bring legal action. In that case the flooding was deemed permanent, construction is different and was seen as temporary in Echo. Peter would most likely be able to collect damages for the BCQE. Like in Echo, where the claim for constructive eviction was not enough, the interference of the construction was enough to provide damages for the tenant. Here the construction caused Peter's revenue to go down, and the number of customers showing up also went down. The process of delivery was also harder, as the construction prevented the drivers from parking near the buikding. So, since the construction was taking far longer than expected, it is likely that he could recover damages. ",992,748
5b2a6aa4-fdf6-40fc-880c-09a15c2fe77b," Dana's (D) conveyance created a defeasible interest for Eve (E). E has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) and D had the right of entry in fee simple absolute (ROE). The conditional language in the conveyance signals to this conveyance being a FSSCS instead of it being a fee simple determinable (FSD). If there were any debate as to whether or not it was a FSD or a FSSCS the courts would likely rely on the rules of construction (ROC) which favors FSSCS over FSD. When D passed away she conveyed her future interest to her daughter Fiona (F) giving her the right of entry in fee simple absolute if E were to ever attempt to sell the property. F has a basis for holding E accountable for the repairs needed to blackacre. E has clearly engaged in permissive waste by allowing the property to fall into disrepair while she was away for five years. Permissive waste occurs when the present interest holder allows the properpty to fall into a state of disrepair due to their innaction. It was E's duty to make sure that the property stayed in good repair for the future interest holder and her failing to do so means that she will be held accountable for her innaction. Courts tend to try and avoid waste and when they see it they try to remedy the situation. This does not mean the court is likely to allow for damages however, they will likely require E to restore the property to the condition it was in before. This argument is strong seeing as there is no question as to wheter or not E allowed for perimssive waste. F's basis for reclaming blackacre rest on E attempting to sell the property. E has recieved an offer on the property and one could argue that she is contemplating selling the property due to its value having increased over the past couple of years. F could argue that this amounts to an attempt on E's part to sell the property and that she therefore she has the right to enter the property and take it back. F could also argue that the ROC state the grantors intentions should be considered. F could argue the point that her mother clearly wanted to keep the property in the family due to the fact that there is sentimental value attached to it and the language of conveyance. This could lead a reasonable jury to the conclusion that D did not mean for the property to be sold and allow for F to retake it E attempts to do so. These are F's strongest arguments for being able to re-enter and take back the property. It's important to note that nothing happens until E attempts to sell the property, 5 having recieved unsolicited offers is not the her same as her actively trying to sell it, this could be an argument that she makes. mother clearly wanted to keep the property in the family due to the fact that there is sentimental value attached to it and the language of conveyance. This could lead a reasonable jury to the conclusion that D did not mean for the property to be sold and allow for F to retake it E attempts to do so. These are F's strongest arguments for being able to re-enter and take back the property. It's important to note that nothing happens until E attempts to sell the property, her having recieved unsolicited offers is not the same as her actively trying to sell it, this could be an argument that she makes. E could argue that the language in the conveyance was ambigious and therfore the ROC should be consulted. She could argue that this conveyance was essentially a complete transefer of the grantors interest and that the court should consider her interest in the land a FSA. The ROC stipulate that courts do not want to resrtict the alienability of property and the conditon that she cannot sell the land ever is a restriction on alienability. However, this argument may not work for E seeing as the ROC stipulate that the grantors intent be taken into account. D clearly did not want the land to be sold off and she even left her interest to her daughter, F. E would need to convince a jury that D did not mean to keep the property in the family. E could also argue that she has the right to sell some of the property is she needs the money. In the widow case the court allowed for the elderly widow to sell part of the property in order to survive agaisnt the will of the future interest holder. The court also took into account the increasing value of the property. This propertys value is clearly increasing and a court could allow for her to sell part of the property. However, this argument is weak. Unless E can convince the courts that the original conveyance was ambigious and that D intended for her to have a life estate or own the property out right the ROC favoring alianability and the widow case would not apply. "," Peter (P) is entitled to certain rights as a commerical tenant. Clearly Linda's(L) actions have violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The construction work had taken longer than L had said it would. It has impacted his work and his parking spot. For the CQE to be violated the landlords actions or inactions need to impact the tenants ability to enjoy the property and clearly the landlords actions have adversely affected P. In the Echo case the court opined that a landlords actions or inactions can amount amount to a breach of the CQE without having to amount to a constructive eviction. The facts in that case are similar to the facts in this one and therefore P has a case to make. P could also argue that he was partially evicted from the premesis. His parking space was incroached on by the construction crew and this is an issue based on the lease he signed. The lease he signed guaranteed him one designated parking spot. The construction equipment being on the spot is enough to be considered an actual eviction seeing as the landlord likely allowed it to be put there. This is similar to a breach of the CQE without having to amount to a constructive eviction. The facts in that case are similar to the facts in this one and therefore P has a case to make. P could also argue that he was partially evicted from the premesis. His parking space was incroached on by the construction crew and this is an issue based on the lease he signed. The lease he signed guaranteed him one designated parking spot. The construction equipment being on the spot is enough to be considered an actual eviction seeing as the landlord likely allowed it to be put there. This is similar to the wagon case in which the landlord allowed for a building to be built on a small part of the property. This amounted to a partial eviction due to the fact that the tenant should have access to all of the land mentioned in the lease. For this issue P can withold rent however he must still take care of the property, which he has done seeing as he continued to work there despite being put through a lot of hassle. P cannot argue that he was partially evicted from the rest of the property other than his parking space. The words in the lease mention that he has common access to the buiding and the common parking lot in the back which the employees use. This is similar to the Echo case in which the court found that the company and its employees were not prevented from entering the property via the common entry ways because they could still enter the building via another entrance. P's employees and customers can still use the front door and the common parking lot. Although it may be an inconvience, a court is not likely to find that P has been partially evicted from more than just his designated parking spot, L is likely to argue this. P can claim constructive eviction after months of the issues persisting if he meets certain criteria. In order to claim constructive eviction there are 4 criteria that must be met; (1) The landlords actions disrupt the tenants use of the property, (2) those disruptions are substantial, (3) the tenant gives notice, and (4) the tenant moves out. Clearly the landlords actions have disrupted the use of the property and they are substantial. P has notifed the landlord every week of the issues and is continuing to lose money due to the disruptons. The next steps for him will be to give notice and leave the the property in order to claim construtive eviction and not be held accountable for the breaking of the lease. This fact pattern is similar to that in the flooding office case. In that case the tennant had dealt with regular flooding. She notifed the landlords of the problem, gave them time to fix the issue (which she didnt), gave adequate notice, and then they vacated the property. P just needs to give notice and then vacate the property. However, once he does so seeing as he is on the hook for the lease until the issue is deliberated I would suggest that he put aside the money for rent in a seperate account if case the court holds him liable for rent. However, L could argue that he did not leave in a reasonable amount of time seeing as months passed before he decided to initiate the procedure to vacate the property. This argument would be similar to that mentioned in the flooding office case. However, the court also found that what constitutes notifed the landlords of the problem, gave them time to fix the issue (which she didnt), gave adequate notice, and then they vacated the property. P just needs to give notice and then vacate the property. However, once he does so seeing as he is on the hook for the lease until the issue is deliberated I would suggest that he put aside the money for rent in a seperate account if case the court holds him liable for rent. However, L could argue that he did not leave in a reasonable amount of time seeing as months passed before he decided to initiate the procedure to vacate the property. This argument would be similar to that mentioned in the flooding office case. However, the court also found that what constitutes a reasonable amount of time to vacate the premesis varies from case to case. In this case it could be argued that P was trying to wait it out but was constantly losing money and that P leaving when he does is reasonable. P would be breaking the lease which he had just renewed for five years. Seeing as he could attempt to claim construtive eviction, once the landlord recieves notice of him intending to leave the property and he moves out it is then the landlords duty to mitigate damages and seek out another tenant in a reasonable amount of time to take P's place. The landlord cannot sit on the property for the remainined time on the lease and then in 5 years sue him for the back rent. This is similar to the failed marriage case in which the tenant notifed the landlord he could not take the apartment anymore. Rather than letting someone new move in, the landlord kept the apartment empty despite there being someone who showed interest in the property. The court found that it was his duty to mitigate damages and not allow the property to sit there vacant. The same rule will apply for P's landlord. P has a strong case. The CQE was violated, he was partially evicted from the property, and once he give the landlord notice and leaves the property breaking the lease it becomes the landlords duty to mitigate damages.

611c531a-6e74-4b72-a2d1-bdae2a717f67," Question 1: Interests at time of conveyance: Dana: Possibility of Reverter or Right of Re-Entry/Power of Termination in Fee Simple Absolute Eve: Fee Simple Determinable or Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent There are two options for what the interests are at the time of conveyance because it is ambiguous. The durational language ""only so long as"" would seem to imply a FSD conveyance. HOwever, the ""provided that"" language is conditional and therefore the conveyance could be a FSSCS. If it is determined that Eve has an FSD then Dana would have the future interest of possibility of reverter. If it was determined to be a FSSCS then Dana would have the right of re-entry or power of termination in FSA. Should be noted that Fiona has no interest until Dana dies and leaves her property to Fiona. When this occured, Dana's future interest was devised by will to Fiona and now Fiona has either a Possibility of Reverter or Right of Re-entry/Power of termination. Eve Arguments: Eve should use the White v. Brown case and the Rules of Construction in her argument in favor determining whether or not the selling the house is permitted and whether it is an FSD or FSSCS. In White, the party who died left a will leaving her house to her daughter with the express statement the house is not to be sold. Here, Dana also expressly stated the house is not to be sold. The court in White held that the rules of construction favor free alienability, FSA, and to avoid partial intestacy and the express statement of not selling the house did not outweigh those factors. If that reasoning was applied here, the court would likely rule in favor of Eve's ability to sell the house. Second, Eve should argue that selling the property is how to fulfill the economic potential of the land and avoid economic waste. However, this is a weak argument because it follows an reversed decision. In the farm selling case, the present interest holder wished to sell the farm but the future interest holders wanted to wait because the property would greatly appreciate in value and thus, waiting to sell would held that the rules of construction favor free alienability, FSA, and to avoid partial intestacy and the express statement of not selling the house did not outweigh those factors. If that reasoning was applied here, the court would likely rule in favor of Eve's ability to sell the house. Second, Eve should argue that selling the property is how to fulfill the economic potential of the land and avoid economic waste. However, this is a weak argument because it follows an reversed decision. In the farm selling case, the present interest holder wished to sell the farm but the future interest holders wanted to wait because the property would greatly appreciate in value and thus, waiting to sell would fulfill the full economic potential. Trial court ruled in favor of the future interest holders. However, the appeals court ruled that economic potential is not the exlcusive test. Courts should also look to see if the family has historically lived on the property and has sentimental connection to the land. Here, Dana and her family have at least lived on the land since 1980 and Fiona was raised on the land. Furthermore, Fiona expressly states she was sentimental about the property and wished to move back. Therefore, Fiona has satisfied the historical connection element and sentimental connection element. The third issue is whether Eve's curiousness constitutes and attempt to sell. While unlikely to qualify as an attempt as there was no affirmative action on Eve's part to sell the land such as contacting the agent or putting in an advertisement, if it was determined to qualify as an attempt then it would be important to resolve the ambiguity of the conveyance as if it is an FSD and qualifies as an attempt, Fiona automatically regains interest. If determined to be an FSSCS and an attempt then Fiona must physically enter the property to retake possession. Eve should argue that her curiousness is not an attempt to sell as the offer she received was completely unsolicited and she has taken no affirmative action to sell the home. Furthermore, in order to require Fiona to affirmatively enter and repossess the property, Eve should once again argue using the Rules of construction, which favor FSSCS over FSD because, as a matter of policy, courts want property owners to actually retake the land under logic similar to the earning theory of property rights. If it is an FSD then the future interest holder has possibility of reverter, which once the durational condition is violated, automatically goes to the future interest holder with no action on their part. This goes against the policy of the earning theory. Fiona Arguents: THe first argument Fiona should make is in regards to the #1 rule of construction which dicates the court should follow the intent of the grantor. The dissent in WHite, argued that the majority's ruling of allowing the house to be sold appeared to fly in the face of the grantor's intent as the grantor seemed to expressly indicate what they did not want to have happen. Here, Dana also expressly stated she did not Fiona Arguents: THe first argument Fiona should make is in regards to the #1 rule of construction which dicates the court should follow the intent of the grantor. The dissent in WHite, argued that the majority's ruling of allowing the house to be sold appeared to fly in the face of the grantor's intent as the grantor seemed to expressly indicate what they did not want to have happen. Here, Dana also expressly stated she did not want the house to be sold. Furthermore, it is stated that Dana wanted to Keep Blackacre in her family, which is why she conveyed it t oEve in the first place rather than sell it. Fiona should argue that these facts show the intent of the grantor (Dana) was to keep the house in the family and urge the court to follow the #1 rule of construction. Fiona could also argue that Eve should not have an interest in the land and should pay for the repairs because she committed waste, and because Fiona inherited Dana's future interest, Fiona may bring action against Eve. The doctrine of waste, as a matter of policy, reasons that a future interest holder should come into possession of the property in the same condition it was in when the present interest holder came into possession. There are four types of waste including affirmative, permissive, amerliorative, and economic. Economic waste is when the property is not being used to its full economic value and ameliorative waste occurs when the present interest holder makes changes to the property that increase the property value. Ameliorative waste is no longer followed in modern courts. However, these do not seem to apply here so it will not be discussed further. But, Fiona could argue either affirmative or permissive waste. Affirmative waste occurs when the present interest holder's voluntary actions to the property decrease its market value such as altering buildings. Here, Eve voluntarily chose to neglect the property and allow it to fall in disarray as seen with the cracked glass and missing shingles. Fiona could also argue that the neglect was an act of permissive waste. Permissive waste occurs when the present interest holder neglects to maintain the property in good condition and the missing shingles and broken glass could be used to indicate neglect of the property. However, Eve could counter this by arguing she did not commit permissive waste because she had continued to pay the real estate taxes. However, this is a weak argument because there missing shingles and broken glass is strong evidence the property was neglected. Furthermore, Fiona should argue that the conveyance created an FSD. As mentioned previously, while the rules of construction dictate that any ambiguity between FSD and FSSCS should favor FSSCS, the Marrenholz case held otherwise. In that case, the 4school was conveyed using both conditional and durational language which led to a dispute. The court held that a grant of exlusive use (""only"") followed by durational language (""so long as"") created a FSD not and FSSCS. If applied here, the ""only so long the real estate taxes. However, this is a weak argument because there missing shingles and broken glass is strong evidence the property was neglected. Furthermore, Fiona should argue that the conveyance created an FSD.

The court held that a grant of exlusive use (""only"") followed by durational language (""so long as"") created a FSD not and FSSCS. If applied here, the ""only so long as"" appears to follow the same construction: a grant of exlusive use followed by durational language. However, the Marrenholz case appears to be an exception to the rule so Fiona should be advised it is not a strong argument. 2) Outline: 1: Term of years Lease T liable unless breach by LL of CQE or IWH 2: Obligations: 1.

On the other hand, Peter is obligated to pay the rent, abide by the terms of the lease, and not commit waste. Peter should also know that he is in a Term of Years lease meaning, he will be liable for the full amount of rent for the term of the lease unless Linda has breached the CQE. However, should Peter chose to leave, Linda has a duty to mitigate damages by a good faith effort to re-let the premises as ruled in Sommer. In which case, Peter would only be liable for rent for the difference between when he left and when the new tenant moves in. In SOmmer, the tenant who was supposed to move in could no longer do so. THe landlord waited for the lease to expire and then charged him for the full lease term rent. THe court ruled the landlord has a duty to, in good faith, attmept to relet the premises. THis could be shown through testimony or evidence of advertisements etc. Peter should also be adivsed that Linda has an obligation to provide the CQE. BReaches of the CQE may result in actual eviction, partial eviction, constructive eviction, or damages. Actual eviction occurs when the tenant is evicted from the entire premises. This is not applicabe here so will not be discussed. Partial eviction occurs when actions by the landlord or by someone for whom the landlord is responsible actually evicts the tenant from use of part of the premises as seen in the old Boston case. There, the landlord erected a brick wall that encroached on part of the area the tenant was using for storage. Here, the contractors' scaffolding partially encorached on Peter's designated parking spot as stated in the lease. Furthermore, the court int the old Boston case ruled that as a matter of policy, because the premises are rented as a whole, and encroachment on said premises automatically suspends the tenants obligation to pay rent until the lease can be renegotiated and rent appropriately apportioned for the new leased premises. Therefore, Peter should argue that as in the Old Boston case, he was partially evicted from the premises designated in the lease and he is not obligated to pay rent until the partial eviction is cured. However, Linda could argue that because he can still use the parking spot it is not being encorached on. This is weak argument because the test does not look to see if the tenant can still use the property but rather if there was any encroachment. Furthermore, Peter should be advised that he does not meet the threshold for constructive eviction. Constructive eviction occurs when there is some 7defect or event that essentially deprives the tenant of total use of the premises without them actually being evicted. Constructive eviction's elements are: (1) a substantial intereference by the landlord or by someone for whome the landlord is responsible; (2) partial eviction is cured. However, Linda could argue that because he can still use the parking spot it is not being encorached on. This is weak argument because the test does not look to see if the tenant can still use the property but rather if there was any encroachment. Furthermore, Peter should be advised that he does not meet the threshold for constructive eviction. Constructive eviction occurs when there is some defect or event that essentially deprives the tenant of total use of the premises without them actually being evicted. Constructive eviction's elements are: (1) a substantial intereference by the landlord or by someone for whome the landlord is responsible; (2) tenant gave notice of the problem to the landlord; (3) tenant gave the landlord reasonable time to fix the problem; (4) tenant vacated the premises within a reasonable amount of time. In Reste, the leased premises had reoccuring serious flooding, the tenant notified the landlord of the problem, allowed the landlord a reasonable time to fix, and vacated the property. Here, Peter gave notice of the problem to the landlord and gave her months to finish the construction so elements 2 and 3 are satisfied. However, as seen in the Echo case, it is unlikely that the construction would amount to a ""substantial interference"". In Echo, there was loud noises from the construction and the construction blocked access to the ""common door"" that the plaintiff thought was described in the lease. Similarly here, there is a lot of noise coming from the construction and it has blocked beneficial use of a door they often use. Therefore, court would likely hold that as in Echo, ""common door"" means any door with common access and that because construction is temporary, the noise is more of an annoyance than substantial intereference. Lastly, Peter should know that constructive eviction is not available to him because he has not vacated the premises as is required under the holding in the Reste case. Peter is permitted to collected damages however, as seen in Echo. In Echo, the court held that the annoyances from the long term construction and issues with the ""common door"" while not meeting the threshold of substantial intereference as required for constructive eviction, did break the CQE and allow for compensatory and punitive damages to be awarded to the tenant. This would be good argument for Peter because it is factually similar to echo. Here, there was long-term construction that lasted much longer than anticipated that decreased his beneficial use and enjoyment of the property and hurt his business's profits. Typically, Peter would be only allowed to receive compensatory damages but, if the court finds Linda's behavior to be so wanton, willful, or fraudulent as to make an example of her, then Peter may receive punitive damages as well. Peter should also be advised that the implied warranty of habitiability does not apply here because it is only applicable to residential leases and Peter holds a commercial lease. Therefore, it will not be discussed further Peter should also be advised that the landlord has no right to re-entry of the premises under Berg. While court finds Linda's behavior to be so wanton, willful, or fraudulent as to make an example of her, then Peter may receive punitive damages as well. Peter should also be advised that the implied warranty of habitiability does not apply here because it is only applicable to residential leases and Peter holds a commercial lease. Therefore, it will not be discussed further Peter should also be advised that the landlord has no right to re-entry of the premises under Berg. While Linda may argue that she is permitted to re-enter so long as it is peaceable, that is the traditional rule that is no longer followed. The court in Berg overturned the traditional rule as a matter of policy. It reasoned, that the peaceable requirement could incentivize tenants to become violent should the landlord attempt to re-enter. Therefore, under the Berg ruling (now the modern rule), a landlord is never permitted to self help re-entry and should resort to the expeditied judicial processes to remove a tenant. Furthermore, Peter should be advised that Linda is not liable for a breach of CQE if the breach was caused by any voluntary action or inaction by the tenant. However, this is also not applicable as it appears Linda undertook the construction voluntarily which then arguably breached the CQE. However, under the doctrine of Caveat lessee, Linda may attempt to argue that she did not break the CQE because Peter accepted the premises as they were, including all latent and patent defects when he signed the lease and then continued to renew the lease. However, as a matter of policy, courts no longer follow this doctrine and there is no assumption of risk by the tenant. The courts reasoned that when this doctrine was created, tenants were in a much better position to repair the premises on their own, however, times have changed and most tenants are now city dwellers with little knowledge on how to repair defects in an apartment. Furthermore, the courts reasoned that many tenants now live in multi-unit dwellings so it would be extremely difficult for a lay-person to figure out how to repair a complicated system like airconditioning, heat, plumbing etc. Lastly, the court reasoned the doctine should no longer apply because the landlord is in a much better position to be knowledgeable of the defects and repair them. If Peter stops paying his rent due to the alleged breach of CQE, Linda may argue that her obligation to provide CQE and the obligation for Peter to pay rent are mutually independent covenants. This means that even if it is found Linda breached CQE, Peter still owes her rent as her breach does not release Peter from his obligation to pay. However, once again this is a weak argument because courts no longer consider the obligations of the landlord and the obligations of the tenant as mutually independent. Rather, modern courts consider these obligations as mutually dependent. This means that if one party breaches their obligations, then the other party is automatically relieved of their obligations as well. If Peter stops paying his rent due to the alleged breach of CQE, Linda may argue that her obligation to provide CQE and the obligation for Peter to pay rent are mutually independent covenants. This means that even if it is found Linda breached CQE, Peter still owes her rent as her breach does not release Peter from his obligation to pay. However, once again this is a weak argument because courts no longer consider the obligations of the landlord and the obligations of the tenant as mutually independent. Rather, modern courts consider these obligations as mutually dependent. This means that if one party breaches their obligations, then the other party is automatically relieved of their obligations as well. Therefore, if it is found that Linda breached CQE, modern courts would find that Peter was no longer obligated to pay rent. Peter could also attempt to surrender the premises by clearly conveying his intention to vacate and default as seen in Sommer. In Sommer, the tenant wrote a note to the landlord describing his situation and expressing he would not be taking possession of the property and included his key in the letter. The landlord never responded. The court held that the landlord's silence and subsequent re-entry into the apartment constituted an acceptance of the surrender. Here, Peter could express his intent to leave to Linda, however if she simply says no or does not re-enter into the apartment, she could argue she never accepted the surrender and Peter is still liable for the full term of the rent. However, even if she does not accept surrender and Peter leaves, Linda must put forth a good faith effort to re-let the apartment and mitigate damages as mentioned above. Lastly, if Peter wants to get out of the lease and ensure he is not liable for the remainder of the rent he should convey the total remainder of his interest (total remainder of the lease) in the premises to another party, who would become the assignee and make his intent to convey the total interest expressly clear. If he assignes the lease, the assignee would be liable to the landlord for rent under privity and Peter would not be liable at all. However to not be liable for rent, he must ensure he conveys the total remaining interest in the property and clearly expresses his intent to do so. As seen in Ernst, there was ambiguity in the conveyance of the go kart property. The tradtional rule exlusively looks to whether or not the assignor conveyed the total remainder of the interest to another party. If the assingor retained no interest then it is an assignment. If they retained some interest, even for a day or an hour, then it is considered a sublease. Furthermore, under the modern approach adopted in Ernst, the courts now look to the intent of the parties. Assuming Peter conveys the entirety of his remaining interest and is expressly clear in his intent to do so, courts should find that he created and assignment. However, if Peter does not convey his total remaining interest or did not clearly express his intent to do so or charges a higher rent rate to the purported assignee, a court may find that he conveyed a sublease. If it is a sublease and the sublessee defaults on the rent, then Peter is still liable for rent to Linda because there is privity between then it is an assignment. If they retained some interest, even for a day or an hour, then it is considered a sublease. Furthermore, under the modern approach adopted in Ernst, the courts now look to the intent of the parties. Assuming Peter conveys the entirety of his remaining interest and is expressly clear in his intent to do so, courts should find that he created and assignment.

If it is a sublease and the sublessee defaults on the rent, then Peter is still liable for rent to Linda because there is privity between Peter and Linda but no privity between Linda and the subtenant.

8c9de0d1-eff5-4b5c-b1ff-7cecd2bb6c34," Dana's estate has the power of reverter at the time that this is taking place. When Dana conveyed her interest to Eve she stipulated that the house was not to be sold and that Eve was not to eve attempt to sell the house. The language ""so long as"" defines this conveyance as a Fee Simple Determinable due to the durational language used. This means that Dana's estate would have the possibility of reverter and that as soon as Eve began negotiations to sell the house it would come back into the possession of Dana's estate. There is the option however that the court will view the conveyance with Dana's intention and not her specific language. Her inent was to give the home to someone who would value it and live in it. Eve has done those things and thus may be the sole owner of the home. Eve presently has an FSD and is not allowed to sell the house according to the verbiage in Dana's conveyance. Eve however can apply the policy rationale that the house could be making more money if she were to sell it as it is not being used and someone wants to buy it for a lot of money. There is also the fact that she is sleeping on her property and that policy dictates that we do not want to let land go to waste when someone else could be using it. Eve could argue that Dana's stipluations in conveyance was merely a request and that she owes the property in fee simple absolute and thus can do whatever she wants with the property. Eve could also argue that Dana's will left Fiona all of her personal property which does not include her real property such as the home. Eve could also note that Fiona expressed a lack of interest in returning to the home while her mother was alive thus making the statement that she was not interested in the house and that any sentimental claims may be less compelling. There is also the possibilty that the court would read Dana's specific language and not her intent and the language specifically said that the house was not to be sold. There is also the argument that Eve has been paying the taxes on the house for years and that that may be enough to show that she was caring for the house while she was away. She was insuring that the house would still belong to the family when they finally returned to New Suffolk. Eve can also make the argument that she did not seek out the offer that the realestate agent brought her. She was reached out to by them and thus she had nothing to do with the offer. She also could argue that looking for the best offer does not mean that she is attempting to sell. At that point she would not be working towards signing douments or accepting offers and thus may not really be looking to sell the property. Eve can also bring up the fact that this was also her childhood home so any sentimental claim that Fiona has Eve has also. while she was away. She was insuring that the house would still belong to the family when they finally returned to New Suffolk. Eve can also make the argument that she did not seek out the offer that the realestate agent brought her. She was reached out to by them and thus she had nothing to do with the fer. She also could argue that looking for the best offer does not mean that she is attempting to sell. At that point she would not be working towards signing douments or accepting offers and thus may not really be looking to sell the property. Eve can also bring up the fact that this was also her childhood home so any sentimental claim that Fiona has Eve has also. Fiona having decided that she wants to move back into the home would be interested in having the home restored and given to her. Her best argument for geting the house is that when Eve began negotiations with the realtor and started to think of selling the property it was immediately taken from her and given back to Dana's estate which left all of her assests to Fiona thus giving Fiona the house. Fiona could argue that Eve has been sleeping on this property and has let it fall to the wayside. This would be an application of permissive waste given that it has been neglicted for 5 years. There is also the application of the Arkland case that the things to look at when assessing the value and who should get the property are not only monetary in nature. The house means a lot to Fiona and as seen in the Arkland case that is something that the court takes into account when deciding these things. Fiona also wants Eve to be the one to take care of the repairs. Fiona's argument here would be that Eve was the one who let the house get into this state and thus she should be responsible. It was her negligence that left the house alone for 5 years and given that she is now attempting to sell the house, it belongs to Fiona and Eve will have reduced the value of the home. Fiona could also argue the point of the dissent in the case with the grandmothers ambigious will, that Dana clearly knew how to give a gift unambigously as seen with her personal property. So given that information, why would she not do the same in this situation if that is what she wanted to do when giving the house to Eve. There is also the point to be made that the only reason that she gave the house to Eve in the first place is that Fiona had on no interest in going back to New Suffolk ini the first place. Thus the first person that was on Dana's mind when deciding what to do with the home was Fiona and if she had known that Fiona would want to come back someday she would not have gotten rid of the house. "," Peter has been constructively and actually evicted from his commercial building which is a violation of his covenant of quiet enjoyment. He is enetitiled to the space and ammenities that are in his lease and the use of his building as a commercial shop.

He is enetitiled to the space and ammenities that are in his lease and the use of his building as a commercial shop. Peter is presently being encroached up by construction equipment in the parking lot which is cutting into his parking spot that he was given by the lease and the construction itself is slowing his business and making it less functional and efficient. Peter has taken the first 2 steps to qualify as a constructive eviction and demonstate that his CQE is being stymied by the construciton. Peter first alerted the land lord that he was concerned and he was assured that the repairs would be taken care of in a reasonable amount of time. Peter also gave more than a reasonable amount of time for the repairs to be fixed. He gave them the week that they were requesting and then months after that. There is also the issue of the construction equipment actualy evicting him via encroachment on his leased property. In the brick wall case, the few inches were enough to count as an actual eviction and seeing as he is entitled to the entire parking place and now only has access to a small space it seems that that same idea could be applied here. Another concern of Peter's is that he has already had to make adjustments to the way that he operates due to the construction dust and noise. He has had to start keeping the windows closed which is limiting his enjoyment of the space. Peter now is concerned that the construction is negatively affecting his buisness and thus wants to consider moving out, but not if he will still owe the 5 years of rent. Peter has done nearly all of the steps to be constructively evicted except leaving. The next step would be to leave the building. Peter does not want to be liable for the 5 years of rent so given that he shows how he was constructivly and actually evicted I don't believe that there is a way that he would own the rent, but on the flip side there is the idea that if Peter leaves and it is ruled that he is not evicted it would be an abandonment in which he would be liable for the rent. There is also the option to discuss this further with his landlord and detemine if there was a way to agree to a surrendering of the property and end the lease. Given that Peter has been there for such a long time it would go without saying that he and the landlord are good terms and should be more understanding of one another. Policy wants to avoid self help and encourage kindness among those in business. Much like Jackson v. Wiley where the grantor was trying to get the lessee to move out and resorted to self help methods, this is not what the law is trying to encourage. They are encourageing peacable conversations and taking those who are having issues of this nature to court and letting things be handled there. If the landlord agrees 5 the surrender the property would be surrendered to and the landlord would have a duty to try to find another renter in that period of time. If the landlord can not find a renter Peter may still be on the hook for the rent or a portion of the rent, but only given that be more understanding of one another.

If the landlord can not find a renter Peter may still be on the hook for the rent or a portion of the rent, but only given that the landlord did that duty with care and fully attempted to find a new tenant. On the flip side of this argument is the Land Lord who is doing her best to fix the repair in a timely manner, but seeing as it is out of her control there is not much more that she can do besides provide Peter with damages and reduced rent which she has done. In the Echo Consulting case the inaccessibilty of the door was called an inconvience, but was not grounds for abandonment or surrender. It was ruled that damages would be sufficeint to account for the hardships faced by the company. Another arguement that the land lord can make is that the scaffolding is not completely blocking the door. There is room for customers to make their way to the pizza place, but it is much less convienent. The landlord could also aruge that she is just doing her duty to maintain the building that Peter's pizza place resides in and that without the the building being structrually sound it would be a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The landlord could also rebut the facts of Echo consulting in saying that this issue is even less than that issue was and that that could further mitigate damages that the landlord could be liable for. The landlord could also contrast this with Reste Realty. In that case, it was ruled a constructive eviction because the cause of the flooding was never going to change where as here the scaffolding will be taken away eventually and this will cease to be an issue for Peter.

d43eda57-827c-4f18-af5f-dcd5b9660eec," Question 1 The first issue is what kind of conveyance was created when Dana made her will. The rules of conveyances when they are ambiguous is to favor fee simple absolute, avoid partial intestacy, and there should be no alienability. Here, Dana seems to convey her land to Eve however there looks like there is a condition in it where it uses languages like ""provided that"" and ""only so long as"". The ""provided that"" suggests a conditional language however the ""only so long as"" suggests a durational language. This is similar to the Marhenolz case where the conveynace used languages that suggested both a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter in fee simple absoulte, and a fee simple subject to condition subsequent with a right of entry/power of termination in fee simple absoulte. Part of the court's analaysis was that they looked at the intent of the grantor and it seemed that the word only construed as the faiulre of the School using the property for other uses allowed the grantor to automatically take possession, which is a fee simple determinable. Here however, there is no indication on whether Dana would want her heirs to take the house back automatically or have to access that right. However, this ambigious language can also turn to Eve making an arguement that she has this land in fee simple absolute becasue just like White v Brown, there was an ambigious will where Jesse did not want her house to be sold and gave her neice all of her property. Here similairy, Dana gave the property to Eve, but she speicifically mentioned she did not want it to be sold and gave the rest of her remaining property to her daughter Fiona. If following the majority rule of White v Brown, the conveyance would give Eve a fee simple absolute becasue rules of construction favors fee simple absoulte and there shouldn't be a restrain on alienability. The policy rationale with this is that, people should have the right to do whatever they want with the land becasue they are the champion of all estates. Therefore, Eve would have a strong claim on the land in her favor of it being in fee simple absolute. FIona however can argue that the clear language of the deed says that the house should be sold, which does put a restrain on alaineability. Looking at the dissent of White v Brown, the judge reasoned that the grantor new how to make a gift and it was clear that there was parital intestacy since the neice got the rest of the property. Therefore, the will was not ambigous and it was actually a life estate. Here similarly, there was partial intestacy since Dana gave her personal property to Fiona and left the house for Eve. This goes against the rules of construction and therefore, Fiona can have a strong claim and argue that Eve does not have a fee simple absolute but the land in her favor of it being in fee simple absolute. FIona however can argue that the clear language of the deed says that the house should be sold, which does put a restrain on alaineability. Looking at the dissent of White v Brown, the judge reasoned that the grantor new how to make a gift and it was clear that there was parital intestacy since the neice got the rest of the property. Therefore, the will was not ambigous and it was actually a life estate. Here similarly, there was partial intestacy since Dana gave her personal property to Fiona and left the house for Eve. This goes against the rules of construction and therefore, Fiona can have a strong claim and argue that Eve does not have a fee simple absolute but rather a fee simple determinable or fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and with both, the property would go back to the grantor. Becasue the grantor, DIana, has died, it would go to the heirs at law and in this case would be Fiona since the property shall first be distrubted to the issue, which Fiona is Dana's daughter. The second issue is if Eve does not have a fee simple absolute, can she argue that she has a fee simple determinable and claim quiet title to the land. As mentioned previously, the language of the will uses both durational and condiitonal language as did the Marhenholz case. Becasue the Marehenolz caser construed the word only as the grantor automatically getting the land back, Eve can use that in her argument as to why she should have a fee simple determinabel. However, rules of constructions also say to favor a fee simple subject to condition subsequent becasue there shouldn't be a forfeiture or land. The policy rationale of this is that people shouldn't be able to take other people's land unless they assert that right to do so since this wouldn't be fair for all the time and investement they put on that land. If Eve prevails with a fee simple determinable, as the court found in the Mahrenholz case, then Eve has a strong claim for quiet title as an adverse possessor, which has five elements in order to become the new true owner in fee simple absolute, allowing Eve to do whatver she wanted with the land like sell it. The five elements are continuous, hositilty and under the claim of right, actual possession, notrious and open, and exclusive. The first element of continous means that the adverse possessor is in the land and uses it up until the statute of limitations has ran. The statute of limitation in this district is 10 years and here Eve moves on to Blackacre in 2010. In 2019 however, that is when Fiona comes back to the home and finds out that Eve was trying to sell the land. Assuming that Eve started making plans to sell the land in 2010 (which would then start the time of adverse possession since the condition has been broken and Eve would have an automatic reversion to the land), this would only make Eve in possession of the land for 9 years, which is still within the statute of limitations. Therefore, Eve would have to stay on the land for another year in order for her to successfuly claim she lived on the land for a period of 10 years. Eve may try to argue however that she can tack on the years of Dana's since there was a voluntary transfer, showing there is privity. In Howard v Kunto, the court allows tacking when there is privity when the Eve was trying to sell the land. Assuming that Eve started making plans to sell the land in 2010 (which would then start the time of adverse possession since the condition has been broken and Eve would have an automatic reversion to the land), this would only make Eve in possession of the land for 9 years, which is still within the statute of limitations. Therefore, Eve would have to stay on the land for another year in order for her to successfuly claim she lived on the land for a period of 10 years. Eve may try to argue however that she can tack on the years of Dana's since there was a voluntary transfer, showing there is privity. In Howard v Kunto, the court allows tacking when there is privity when the deed of the house was in correct. The policy rationale of privity was to prevent tresppassors from coming on the land, but when there is a legal transfer, it is allowed. Here, it is clear that there was legal transfer between Dana and Eve so she should be able to tack on the years Dana had. The second element is hostility and under the claim of right. Hostility is not having the permission of the true owner and under the claim of right is the objective standard, meaning the state of mind of the adverse possessor doesn't matter. Given that Eve did not have permission to sell the home, Eve can argue that this element is satisifed. However, Fiona can refute and argue that Eve did have permission to stay on the land since in Dana's will it clearly stated that she could stay on the land. The next element is actual possession. Here, this element is satisified becasue Eve stayed in the house and used it. Further, there was evidence of that the house was used since there was roof shingles missing, glass cracked, etc. The next element is notrious and open which is having the property out in the open where the true owner is on notice that it is being used. This requires constructive knowledge. Eve can argue that Fiona should have known what Eve was doing in the house and her intentions of selling it and therefore she had adequate notice. However if the jurisdiction follows what Mannillo v Gorski held, Fiona can argue that there should be actual knoweldge becasue one could not possibly know what one is intending on doing with the property. However, in Mannillo v Gorksi, the reason why the court used actual knowledge is becasue there was a small encroachment onto the land that was not noticeable. Here, the issue is completely different and Eve can argue that still Fiona was sleeping on her rights and therefore should have been aware of what Eve was up to. The last element is exlcusive. Exclusive means that the adverse possessor is only using the land and not the true owner. As we see, Fiona could not live on Blackacre anymore after her mother's death and so Eve was the only person living there. However, Fiona can argue that she still had the real estate taxes on auto-pay and so technically speaking she still was using the land. Eve can refute this by saying she never came on the property and paying taxes is not using the land. have been aware of what Eve was up to. The last element is exlcusive. Exclusive means that the adverse possessor is only using the land and not the true owner. As we see, Fiona could not live on Blackacre anymore after her mother's death and so Eve was the only person living there. However, Fiona can argue that she still had the real estate taxes on auto-pay and so technically speaking she still was using the land. Eve can refute this by saying she never came on the property and paying taxes is not using the land. In conclusion, Eve could have a strong argument for adverse possession then she would be able to do what she want with the land. The policy rationale of this is that the person who puts the most time and uses the land in the most productive way should get title and be rewarded. The true owner has slept on her rights, and the court disfavors that. If Eve did have adverse possession, she can then argue that she has the land now in fee simple absoulte and can sell her home. The next issue is if Fiona can hold Eve from selling the property if Eve doesn't have the land in a fee simple determinable, but in a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. If Eve had the land in fee simple subject to condition susbequent, that means that Fiona would have a right of entry as soon as the condition was broken, which was Eve selling the home. Fiona can assert this right, and argue that Eve had created permissive waste. Permissive waste is neglecting the property and here we see that the roof shingles are missing and the glass is cracked. Eve was negligent in the care of the property and many courts have ruled that tenants, should not commit permissive waste. Becasue Eve committed permissive waste, Fiona can argue she should be liable to repairs. However, Eve can argue that if they do not sell the property, there would be economic waste which is not putting the property into its most producutive use. It is clear that the land is appreciating and it is worth way more the amount than Eve has ever thought. However, Fiona can argue that just like Baker v Weedon, where the court found that farmland was not economic waste becasue the taxes were still being payed, Fiona can say she still had her automatic payments on annually. Therefore, there was no economic waste. The court also found that all interest should have a say on the land and if there is a sale, it would benefit all. Here, the sale would benefit Eve, but not Fiona since there is sentimental value. In the Arkland case, factors like emotional and sentimental interest were consdiered and not just economic. Fiona can also assert that selling the land is amelrorative waste, which in common law suggests that even if doing something makes the property more valuble, this is still considered waste. However, Eve can argue saying the common law is not adopted in most jurisidcitions and as the court held in Woodrick v Wood, the barn could be sold and the $3200 value that the daughter had in the barn could be given to her to make it equitable. Therefore, Eve can suggest a remedy where she can share the proceeds with Fiona if she does sell the house. and sentimental interest were consdiered and not just economic. Fiona can also assert that selling the land is amelrorative waste, which in common law suggests that even if doing something makes the property more valuble, this is still considered waste.

Therefore, Eve can suggest a remedy where she can share the proceeds with Fiona if she does sell the house. "," First issue is determing what type of lease Peter has that would make him liable to pay rent. Becasue Peter has a fixed end period, which his lease states from Janurary 1, 2019 to December 31, 2023, Peter has a term of years lease. Therefore, if Peter does decide to leave the lease before-hand, he may be liable to pay for the rest of the additional rent he owes. I would advice Peter to put his money on escrow so the courts can see that he is able to pay rent, in case he is found liable to pay the rest of the rent. However, Peter should be aware that as a landlord, Linda has the duty to mitigate damages. Therefore, if Peter decided to surrender or abandon his lease, as the landlord, Linda would have to take reasonble diligence and steps in order to re-let the premise. In Sommer v Kridel, the landlord took no efforts to re-let the property and even turned down potential tenants who could pay rent. The court found that becasue he didn't attempt to mitigate damages, he was not entitled to the additional rent. Therefore, if Linda does not try to find a new tenant, Peter may be free from paying rent. Factors that may include mitigating damages include listing the property on the market, creating showings, etc. If Linda does however mitigate damages and still cannot find a new tenant, she can sue Peter for damages and get the rest of the rent back, up until the lease ended or up until she finds a new tenant. The policy rationale is that landlords are in a better postition than the tenant and therefore should be the one have this burden of proof that they made the effort. This goes against the old contract rule of a breaching party becasue this outcome is most fair and reaches an equitable remedy. The next issue Peter faces is if he decides to leave, can he stop paying rent under covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE). CQE is breached when the landlord interfeers with the tenants ability to enjoy the property in peace. Within quiet enjoyment, Peter can argue actual (partial) eviction, constructive eviction, or damages. Here, Peter may try to argue that he was partially evicted from the pizza shop becasue he did not have full readily available access to the rear door to enter his shop. This argument is similar to the Echo Consulting case where Echo Consulting complained about the bank changing the keys to main door and after business hours they only had access to the rear door, which was highly inconvienent. Here, Peter has access to the rear door however it is not full access. There is a bunch of enjoyment (CQE). CQE is breached when the landlord interfeers with the tenants ability to enjoy the property in peace. Within quiet enjoyment, Peter can argue actual (partial) eviction, constructive eviction, or damages. Here, Peter may try to argue that he was partially evicted from the pizza shop becasue he did not have full readily available access to the rear door to enter his shop. This argument is similar to the Echo Consulting case where Echo Consulting complained about the bank changing the keys to main door and after business hours they only had access to the rear door, which was highly inconvienent. Here, Peter has access to the rear door however it is not full access. There is a bunch of scaffolding all across the rear building which largely blocks access to the rear door. However, the court in Echo found that the lease itself said they had a common use of the main door, but it wasn't their exclusive use. Similarly here, Peter's lease stated he has a common right access to the building but that was not expressly made exlcusive. However, Peter may argue that in the Echo case, the main door was just locked and they couldn't use it while here there is physical large blocks blocking the door. This may be similar to the brickwall case where the court found the encroachment of the wall on the tenants property acted as an eviction since there was a physical blockage. However, here, as previosluy mentioned the lease clearly states that there is a common right of access and since there is multiple doors to access the property, there was not an actual/partial eviction. Peter would next try to argue constructive eviction which has different elements. The first element is that the interference has to come from the landlord and it has to be substantial. The second element is that the landlord has to have been notified and given a reasonble time to fix it. Lastly, the tenant has to leave within a reasonable amount of time. Here, Peter can argue that the landlord interfered with his right to the ppizza shop because she was the one had to make some repairs of the exterior building and hired a contractor. Linda however will likley argue that the interference was not substnatial enough becasue Peter still had use to other doors. ALthough the rear door was the most easily to use, he still could use the backdoor of the entire building and as well as the enterance to the pizza place. This is similar to the Echo Consulting Case where the court found that the interfernce was not substantial enough since there was still access to get into the building. Also, Linda can argue that the construction was going to be completed in a couple of months and therefore was not permananent. In the Reste Realy case, the landlord argued that the interfernce had to be permanenet and the court found that becasue the driveway was permanent and whenever there was a rainstorm, due to the driveway, the basement would flood, thus making the interfernce permanent. Here however, this is not the case where the scaffolding across the rear building will be permananet. The contractor built it there becasue they are constructiong but assuming once they are done it will be removed, this interfernce 11 is not permanent. In Echo Consulting, the court also found that the noise of the construction wasn't permananet, and here although the constructuion is noisy and Peter has to keep the windows closed to take away the dust, this is not a landlord argued that the interfernce had to be permanenet and the court found that becasue the driveway was permanent and whenever there was a rainstorm, due to the driveway, the basement would flood, thus making the interfernce permanent. Here however, this is not the case where the scaffolding across the rear building will be permananet. The contractor built it there becasue they are constructiong but assuming once they are done it will be removed, this interfernce is not permanent. In Echo Consulting, the court also found that the noise of the construction wasn't permananet, and here although the constructuion is noisy and Peter has to keep the windows closed to take away the dust, this is not a permanent interfernce. The second element is that the landlord has to have been notified and given reaonsble time to fix it. Here, this element is met becasue Peter has contacted Linda several times about this issue and tells her his concerns. Linda assured Peter it would be done within a week but each time the deadline gets delayed and it turns into months. Therefore, Linda had notice and enough time to make the repairs. This is similar to the Reste Realty case where the tenant would notifiy the lanlord about the flood in the basement however, they refused to come to fix it. However, Linda can argue that she never refused to fix the issue becasue this is not within her control and she can't rush the contractors job. She can also argue that as a remedy she reduced the rent for Peter and therefore was trying to accomodate his needs. Lastly, Peter would have to move out within a resonable time in order for him to have a successful claim of constructive eviction. Here, Linda can argue that Peter waited a long time to move out and he knew about the construction. This is similar to the Reste Realty case where the landlord argued that the tenant did not move within a reaosnble time and she knew of the flooding of the basement regardless. However, the court found that after the ""final straw"" the tenant moved within 10 days which is a reasonsble time and her knewing about the flood didn't matter since she only renenwed the lease with assurance the driveway would be fixed to stop the flooding. Here, Peter would have to give notice that he is leaving the premise and should not take a long time to move. Also, Peter's knowledge of the construction doesn't matter becasue Linda had told him that it would only take a week or so, which he relied on that information since he closed his pizza shop for the week and went on vacation. If Peter can successfuly claim constructive eviction, he will not have to pay the rest of the rent money, however with all the weaknesses and the potential arguments Linda can make, it is not certain that he will. But, Peter can still receive some damages becasue his covenenat of quiet enjoyment was still breached. Peter can argue that he deserves damages due to the breach of his CQE. As previosuly mentioned, CQE is when the tenant gets to enjoy the property without the landlord interfering. The policy rationale the behind this is that tenants shouldn't have to wait for 11 landlord to repossess the property and they too have an interest in the property. Therefore, Peter should be awarded damages if he has to go through a lot of inconviences and annoyances that disrupts this peace. In the Echo Consulting case, the court that he will. But, Peter can still receive some damages becasue his covenenat of quiet enjoyment was still breached. Peter can argue that he deserves damages due to the breach of his CQE. As previosuly mentioned, CQE is when the tenant gets to enjoy the property without the landlord interfering. The policy rationale behind this is that tenants shouldn't have to wait for the landlord to repossess the property and they too have an interest in the property. Therefore, Peter should be awarded damages if he has to go through a lot of inconviences and annoyances that disrupts this peace. In the Echo Consulting case, the court found that although the noise of the construction was not a substantial or permanant interference for construcvie eviciton, it was annoying and therefore the tenant was entitled to damages. Here, the construction is noisy and the dust prevents Peter from opening his windows. This shows that Peter has a strong claim against damages from Linda since he cannot fully enjoy his pizza shop in peace as a renter. Also, becasue the scaffolding largley blocks the rear door and this causes the pizza delivery man to not deliver the pizzas in a timely manner, this causes lost of revenue and Peter is entiled to damages becasue of this losses. Policy rationale behind Peter getting damages and possibly being able to abate his rent is becasue as a tenant, he should not have to go through many hoops just to use the property. When signing the lease he is supposed to be expected quiet enjoyment of it and that was interrupted. Peter also has to squeeze into his parking spot where he can barely fit and this should be looked at as a violation of his lease since he was entitled a deisgnated parking spot. Therefore, due to all the annoyances, he should be entiteld to damages. Peter may also want to try to argue that he has an implied warrinty of habitualty (IWH), although this may not hold because this is normally used for residential buildings and not commercial buildings. However, Peter can try to argue that he has an IWH where he is entitled to a safe place as a basis for rent and this has been compromised due to the construction workers. Here, Peter can use the scaffolding acorss the rear building as being hazardous and violating muncipal codes as well as arguing that the dust made by the constuction workers can get into the pizza, which could tarnish his reputation of making pizzas and make other people sick. In the Hilder case, the court found that the tenants give rent in order to live in a safe home and it is the landlord's duty to keep up with the saefty of the building. Linda can argue that the unsafety does not amount to what happened in the Hilder case since all of this is happening in the exterior of the building instead of inside the building. In the Hilder case, there was no front door lock, the bathrooms were clogged, etc. and this is not what is happening with Peter. However if Peter prevails with IWH, he has options on what he can do. First he can terminate his lease, or change the terms of it and get his rent reduced.9 He also may be entitled to some damages such as punitive damages for the lanlord violating the IWH. Linda can argue that the unsafety does not amount to what happened in the Hilder case since all of this is happening in the exterior of the building instead of inside the building. In the Hilder case, there was no front door lock, the bathrooms were clogged, etc. and this is not what is happening with Peter. However if Peter prevails with IWH, he has options on what he can do. First he can terminate his lease, or change the terms of it and get his rent reduced. He also may be entitled to some damages such as punitive damages for the lanlord violating the IWH. If Peter does decided to stay in the building and does not want to pay rent, he does not have to be worried of getting kicked out of the building becasue there can be no self-help. Under common law, self-help is allowed when (1) the landlord has a legal title to the property and the tenant breaches his contract, and (2) the means of reentry is peaceable. However, under the modern doctrine, self-help is never used and the landlord must always resort to judicial process. In WIley v Berg, the landlord argued that the tenant violated safety conditions of the resturant and therefore was terminating his lease. The landlord then try to change the locks of the resturant once business hours was over, and the court found this to not be peaceable, even though no one was there. The policy rationale behind this is that the judicial process is quick that there should be no reason to take matters into their own hands. Also, when looking at the element of peaceble reentry, tenants might have an incentive to cause an uproar and be violent so it would ensure there was no peace. Therefore, Linda could not change the locks on Peter's building without first going to court. Linda may try to argue that the common law of self help should be followed instead of the modern doctrine becasue no one want's a public record. She can also argue that it is harder to evict someone when going to the courts and this may lead to her putting the addtitional costs to the other tenants of the commercial building. However, rights of the tenant should be protected and therefore should be no self-help. Advice I would also give Peter if he wanted to no longer be in the building and pay rent is to sublease the premise to a new tenant or find an assignee. Peter can look for a new tenant to sublease the property up unitl the construction is over and that way the new tenant can pay Peter rent and Peter would give this to Linda instead of spending his own money. Becasue Peter would go back to the property after the construction is over, he still has privity of estate with the landlord, but a privity of contract with the transferee since he is the one who is directly dealing with him. The transferee would not be liable to the landlord and would not have privity with her if the transferee decides not to pay rent. However, Peter could still sue to transferee for the rent since they are in privity with eachother. An assignee would be better for Peter due to the fact that Peter would have no revisonary interest on the property and therefroe the transferee would and should be liable to pay the rest of the rent if they were in breach. The reason why is because they now are in privity of estate with the landlord. Although Peter would still construction is over, he still has privity of estate with the landlord, but a privity of contract with the transferee since he is the one who is directly dealing with him. The transferee would not be liable to the landlord and would not have privity with her if the transferee decides not to pay rent. However, Peter could still sue to transferee for the rent since they are in privity with eachother. An assignee would be better for Peter due to the fact that Peter would have no revisonary interest on the property and therefroe the transferee would and should be liable to pay the rest of the rent if they were in breach. The reason why is because they now are in privity of estate with the landlord. Although Peter would still have privity of contract with Linda, it would be more effective if Linda went after the transferee for the additional rent. If Peter does decide to do this, he has to be careful of the language he uses in the lease as to if he wants a sublease or an assignemnt. In Ernstt v Conditt, there was a tranfer of a race track from the tenant to the transferee that used the word sublease, but the transferee paid the rent to the landlord directly and there was no reviosnary intersest with the old tenant. The court found that under the traditonal and modern test, the tranfer was an assignement and not a sublease and the transferee could still be laible to pay the additional rent. The traditonal test is looking to see if there is a reviosonary interst and the modern test is to look at the intent of the parties. Here, Peter may or may not have the intent of leaving the pizza shop on Main Street for good, so depedinging on the type of new lease he forms with the new tenant will determine who would be liable to the landlord if they decided to stop paying rent money.

83af18c1-132e-4728-b685-77436f376b67," Dana's Interests at the Time of Conveyance Dana's conveynace was ambiguous and therefore we must use the rules of contruction to determine what she intended as the grantor. The seven rules of construction are to look to the intent of the grantor, to favor a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS) over a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD), to favor a Fee Simple Absolute (FSA) over a life estate, to disfavor partial intestacy, to favor the free alienation of property, to favor vested remainders over contingent remainders, and to read the document with uniformity.The conveyance is ambiguous because the term ""provided that"" is conditional language that suggests Eve has a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS), meaning Dana would have a power of termination/right of entry. This conflicts with the durational language of ""so long as"" which suggests Eve has a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD), meaning Dana would have a possibility of reverter. The rules of contruction favor a FSSCS over a FSD, therefore the conveyance should be read as a FSSCS and Dana has a power of termination/right of entry. This is distinguishable from the Mahrenholz case where the minority Illinois court favored an FSD over an FSSCS. In addition, the rules of conveyance favor looking at the intent of the grantor. Here, the words ""the house is not to be sold"" shows the intent the grantor had that she does not want her home sold and therefore is favoring a Fee Simple Absolute (FSA) rather than a life estate. This is similar to the White v. Brown case where the court looked to the intent of the grantor and determined that a FSA was preferable to a life estate. Also, because the rules of construction disfavor partial intestacy it is likely that Dana intended in her conveyance to leave all her property to Eve, rather than Fiona who inherets all Dana's personal property as stated in her will. Why Eve Should be Bermitted to Solicit Other Offers Going along with the rules of construction, this conveyance should be interpreted as an FSSCS where the power of termination/ right of entry only becomes possessory on the condiiton that Eve does not try and sell the house. Although eve moved out after 2Dana's death, she continued to pay rent on it through auto-pay ensuring that the land which ensures her ownership of it, and she did not yet sell the home affirmitively and therefore the condition has not been broken and Eve is still rightfully entitled to Why Eve Should be Bermitted to Solicit Other Offers Going along with the rules of construction, this conveyance should be interpreted as an FSSCS where the power of termination/ right of entry only becomes possessory on the condiiton that Eve does not try and sell the house. Although eve moved out after Dana's death, she continued to pay rent on it through auto-pay ensuring that the land which ensures her ownership of it, and she did not yet sell the home affirmitively and therefore the condition has not been broken and Eve is still rightfully entitled to possesion of the property. As a landlord, Eve has a duty to mitigate damages and if she personally is not going to live there, she is allowed to sublet the property as there are no rules in the conveyance that says she cannot (a.k.a mitigate her own damages). Fiona, on the other hand, could argue that the words "" the house should not be sold"" could be interpreted broadly to encompass subleasing and argue that the intent of Dana was for Eve or her estate to be the sole people living in the house/ on the property and by subleasing Eve is breaking the conditon. Eve could also argue that by not selling the home to the bidders that she is therefore commiting waste and selling would be the only way in which to avoid this. Waste occurs when an owner fails to maximize the value of the land over time. Here, Eve could argue that the land would be worth more if sold to the real estate developer and by not selling and by not selling Eve could be committing amelioritive or economic waste. Fiona, on the other hand, could argue that ameliorative waste is not considered waste anymore in most jurisdicitons and that the present economic interest of Eve conflicts with her possible future interest which has sentimental valu, emotional attahcment, as well as longstanding ownership. This conflicitng interests of the present and future interests is similar to that in Baker v. Weedon where the court ruled that one parties economic interest is not weighed as more important than the interests of a future interest holder which can be sentimental value, longstanding ovnership and emotional attahcment. The court ruled that ecoomic value is often self serving and is not the ultimate test for property value and that the best interests of all parties with interest in a piece of property (present and future) must be taken into account. Because once the land is sold in any capacity the condition is broken as layed out in the conveyance, It will be difficult for both Eve and Fiona to be satisfied if Eve wants to sell a portion or all the land and Fiona does not. Fiona's Argument for Reclaiming Ownership of Blackacre / Holding Eve Accountable for Repairs Fiona could argue that because Eve is trying to sell the home that she is breaking the condition which infiringes on her right as a future interest holder. According to Baker v. Weedon future interests are allowed to prevent current interest holders from taking away rights from a future interest holder. Here, because Fiona has a future interest that becomes posessory the moment the condition of selling the house is broken, by selling the home, Eve is infringing on Fiona's rights as a future interest and Fiona is Fiona's Argument for Reclaiming Ownership of Blackacre / Holding Eve Accountable for Repairs Fiona could argue that because Eve is trying to sell the home that she is breaking the condition which infiringes on her right as a future interest holder. According to Baker v. Weedon future interests are allowed to prevent current interest holders from taking away rights from a future interest holder. Here, because Fiona has a future interest that becomes posessory the moment the condition of selling the house is broken, by selling the home, Eve is infringing on Fiona's rights as a future interest and Fiona is allowed to prevent this because courts must consider the interest of all future and present interests. Fiona could also argue that because Eve is attempting to sell the property that the condition of ""the house is not to be sold"" has been broken and therefore as a Dana's issue she gets the power of termination/ right of entry to take back the property from Eve. Fiona could argue that eve is accountable for repairs because she commited permissive waste which occurs when an owner allows property to deteriorate. If Eve does want to sublet, she has a duty to convey a clean and sanitary environment under the Implied Warranty of Habitability (IWH) which cannot be waived as held in Hilder v St. Peter. roof shingles missing, cracked glass, and other serious problems may infringe in the safety and sanitation implied in the IWH and render the home in breach of IWH. Because it is the landlord's duty to provide a clean and safe environment suitible for human habitation, Eve, as the land lord has a duty to make the repairs as well as to avoid being held accountable for allowing permissive waste. "," Peter for Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment Peter for Partial Actual Eviction As a Landlord, Linda has a duty to deliver and not breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE). If this is breached, Peter, the tenant, can be entitled to partial/actual eviciton, constructive eviction, and damages. The CQE is implied in the lease and it means that the tenant has a right to enjoy the leased premises freely without interruption or interference from the landlord. Here, Peter could argue that Linda breached the CQE when her construction project interfered with his ability to conduct business in his pizza shop. Peter first could argue that he was partially/actually evicted from the premises when the construction encroached on his designated parking spot. Similar to the rule in McEany, the rent this is breached, Peter, the tenant, can be entitled to partial/actual eviciton, constructive eviction, and damages. The CQE is implied in the lease and it means that the tenant has a right to enjoy the leased premises freely without interruption or interference from the landlord. Here, Peter could argue that Linda breached the CQE when her construction project interfered with his ability to conduct business in his pizza shop. Peter first could argue that he was partially/actually evicted from the premises when the construction encroached on his designated parking spot. Similar to the rule in McEany, the rent encompasses the free use of ALL premises described in the lease, and if the landlord deprives the tenant of any of the leased premisis then the tenant may withold all rent. Peter could argue that because the landlord is depriving him of some of the leased premise of ""one designated parking spot"" and that he may withold rent as a result. Linda could argue that this encroachment is not substantial enough because Peter can still fit his car in the spot anf and therefore does meet the de minimus rule for actual eviction. The implied warranty of habitability (IWH) does not apply here because this is a commerical space, not a residence, and the IWH only applies to residences. Peter for Constructive Eviction Next, Peter could argue that he was construtively evicted because the conditions make it ""as if he were evicted"". Constructive eviction occurs when a landlord substantially interferes with the tenants use, the tenant has given the landlord proper notice and a reasonable time to fix the damages, and the tenant leaves the premises. Here, Peter could argue that he was constructively evicted through Linda's substantial interference with his leased space through her designated construction because construction is noisy, causes dust, makees it difficult for his deliveries to be made (as it is nearly impossible to bring a car close to the rear door to carry the pizzas out to the car for deliveries and in addition the scaffolding makes it difficult for the delivery persons to carry the pizza around the scaffoliding). Peter could also argue that he gave Linda notice many times and while she promised to fix the damage and that the construction would be done soon, months have passed and nothing has changed. This shows peter gave Linda proper notice by calling to express his concerns every week, and the months passing after Linda promised only a few weeks shows her failure to repair the damages in a reasonable time. Similar to the Reste Realty case, where the tenant promised to make repairs regarding the intermitten flooding and did not, the tenant was construcively evicted. This is similar to Peter's case because although the construction is not permanent, the damage does not have to be permanent for constructive eviction, therefore the temporary scaffolding and construction is similar to the flooding that would only occur after rain storms and other incidents but was not permanently present. Peter's case is also similar to Reste Realty becayse the tenant in that case re-signed the lease without the knowledge of the flooding because the tenant had promise to fix it and therefore signed the lease expecting the damages to be Similar to the Reste Realty case, where the tenant promised to make repairs regarding the intermitten flooding and did not, the tenant was construcively evicted. This is similar to Peter's case because although the construction is not permanent, the damage does not have to be permanent for constructive eviction, therefore the temporary scaffolding and construction is similar to the flooding that would only occur after rain storms and other incidents but was not permanently present. Peter's case is also similar to Reste Realty becayse the tenant in that case re-signed the lease without the knowledge of the flooding because the tenant had promise to fix it and therefore signed the lease expecting the damages to be fixed. This is similar to peter who signed the lease without knowledge of this construction that would inherently affect his abillity to conduct business. Linda, on the other hand, could argue that her deduction of $100/month is an equitable remedy for the construction interference and therefore she is making efforts to repair the damages. Peter could argue that the amount of money he is losing as a result of the construction is more than the $100/month he is getting from Linda and thefore is not a sufficient remedy for the damages Peter is facing.Finally, Peter could argue that because he is thinking about eviction and leaving the premises that he meets all the elements of constructive eviction which includes the requirement of vacating the premises. Linda, on the other hand, could argue that because Peter did NOT vacate the premises that he has not sufficiently abandoned/vacated the premises which is an integral part of contructive eviction and because Peter has not met that requirement he has therefore not been constructively evicted. Peter for Damages Lastly, Peter could argue that he is entitled to damages for the loss of business he has incured as a result of the construction. This case is very similar to the Echo Consulting case where the court held that although the tenant was not actually or constructively evicted, he was entitled to damages based on deprivation of beneficial use. The court in echo broadened the breach of CQE to include the deprivation of beneficial use. In Echo, the court held that because many of the areas that the tenant was deprived of were common areas as described in the lease, the tenant was not considered to have been actually or constructively evicted, but was entitled to damages. According to Echo, deprivation of use of a common areas is not considered an eviction. Linda could argue that the areas Peter is arguing he is being constructively evicted from (the door and parking lot) are common spaces as it defined in the lease for thef door, ""the common right of access"", and the parking lot, ""common use of a parking lot"", and that according to Echo, deprivation of use of a common areas is not considered an eviction. Peter could argue that while he may not be actually or constructively evicted based on Linda's reasoning 7 entitled to damages as a result (also consistent above that she still breached the CQE and that he 6isofstill with Echo). Linda could argue that she already gave him damages by deducting $100/month from his monthly rent for the hassel, but Peter could argue that is not enough compared to the amount he has lost being constructively evicted from (the door and parking lot) are common spaces as it defined in the lease for thef door, ""the common right of access"", and the parking lot, ""common use of a parking lot"", and that according to Echo, deprivation of use of a common areas is not considered an eviction. Peter could argue that while he may not be actually or constructively evicted based on Linda's reasoning above that she still breached the CQE and that he is still entitled to damages as a result (also consistent with Echo). Linda could argue that she already gave him damages by deducting $100/month from his monthly rent for the hassel, but Peter could argue that is not enough compared to the amount he has lost in profits as a result of the construction. Linda Duty to Mitiigate Damages As a lanlord, Linda has a right to mitigate damages if the tenant abandons the premises during the lease or cuts it short in some way. Sommer v. Kridel ruled that is it the duty of the landlord to mitigate damages. Mitigating damages is shown when a landlord takes steps to reasonably re-let the leased space after the lease is cut short in some way. Mitigation could be shown by showing the space to other interested renters, or putting advertisements in the newspaper or online that demonstrate she is tryign to re-let the space. Here, If Peter gives Linda proper notice of his leaving, it would then be Linda's burden/duty to mitigate damages and take steps to reasonably re-let the space, and Peter would not be responsible for the lease payments for the months he left during his leased time. If Peter told Linda now that he was leavng by the end of the month or 2 months, this would liekly be considered proper notice and the burden would then be on Linda to mitigate the damages.

6dc8ed5f-bc91-4ed5-bc1e-2de723a3aae9," The first issue what kind of interests were created by Dana's conveyance. Dana's conveyence to her cousin Eve ""provided that and so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house..."" uses conditional language that provides Eve with Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS) interest. At the the time of conveyance, Dana maintained a Right of Reentry or Power of Termination in Fee Simple Absolute (FSA). Also, at the time of conveyance, Fionna had no interest in Blackacre. However, Dana's Right to Reenter or Power of Termination could pass to Fionna testate after Dana's death. Therefore, after Dana's death Fionna would have an interest in Blackacre. The next issue is whether Eve could be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre. The conveyance states in plain language ""... so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house. The house is not to be sold."" First, Eve could argue that soliciting offers for the sale Blackacre do not necessarily constitiute an ""attempt"" to sell the property. In that case, soliciting offers alone does not violate the condition of her interest in Blackacre. Also, Eve can attempt to argue that because of the grief she experiences being on Blackacre and that she no longer plans to live on or use Blackacre as it is intended to be used that the property should be sold in order for others to use the land as intended. Eve can also argue that because Blackacre has significantly appreciated in value that the economic test should be used in order to justify the solicitation of offers and ultimately the sale of the property. However, when reading the clear language of the conveyance and attempting to interpret the conveyance as the grantor wished, it is clear that Dana did not want the house to be sold. The solicitation of additional offers for the sale of Blackacre are likely to be interpreted as an ""attempt"" to sell the house. Any arguement that the solicitation of offers do not constitute an ""attempt"" will likely be dismissed. Even if they were just for appraisal purposes, a third party could do that without having to solicit offers. Also, arguement that Eve would want the land to be used for intended purposes would likely be dismissed as well. Coupled with the plain language of the conveyance and Fionna's now willingness to live on the land as intended it is likely that the land can be used as intended without having the property being sold. Lastly, the courts have found that the economic test is not the only test to be that could be taken into account by the court, used when interpretting potential conveyances. Although they will also look to the sentimental value and the wishes of the grantor. Therefore, I find it unlikely Eve could make the arguement that she should be permitted to solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre. solicit offers. Also, arguement that Eve would want the land to be used for intended purposes would likely be dismissed as well.

Lastly, the courts have found that the economic test is not the only test to be used when interpretting potential conveyances. Although that could be taken into account by the court, they will also look to the sentimental value and the wishes of the grantor. Therefore, I find it unlikely Eve could make the arguement that she should be permitted to solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre. The next issue is whether Fiona has any basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre and/or for holding Eve accountable for the repairs needed on Blackacre. If Dana's Right to Reentry or Power of Termination passed to Fionna testate, Fionna would now have an executory interest in Blackacre. Therefore, by Eve ""attempting"" to sell the property Fionna can execute that interest in FSA. If Eve were to actively pursue additional offers Fionna may have a basis for reclaiming ownership. However, as stated above Eve has only received an unsolicited offer from a real estate developer and it is unlikely that would constitute an attempt to sell Blackacre. Therefore, it is unlikely at this point that Fionna has a basis for ownership. Also, because Eve does not have a present interest in Blackacre, it is unlikely she will be able to hold Eve accountable for the repairs on the property. Fionna could argue that passive waste has led to the state of the property, but even with the lack of maintenance performed on the property, it has not hurt the economic value of the property since Eve last left the property. The courts have shown willingness to balance the interests of present possessors and future possessors, however, since Fionna's future interests are conditional I think the court would be less likely to hold Eve accountable. "," The issue is whether Linda has broken Peter's covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) or Implied Warranty of Habitability (IWH) by constructive eviction of Peter from the premises by construction not allowing him to operate his business and breaking the terms of his original 5 year lease. Because this is a commercial lease CQE is relied on as a rule as well as IWH which can apply to both commercial and residential properties. Peter's commercial lease allows for the use of approximately 2000 sq ft of floor usage. Despite, the construction that is going on outside the building, Peter's 2000 sq ft are not infringed upon physically. However, after returning from vacation and reopening the restaurant, Peter was forced to keep the allowing him to operate his business and breaking the terms of his original 5 year lease. Because this is a commercial lease CQE is relied on as a rule as well as IWH which can apply to both commercial and residential properties. Peter's commercial lease allows for the use of approximately 2000 sq ft of floor usage. Despite, the construction that is going on outside the building, Peter's 2000 sq ft are not infringed upon physically. However, after returning from vacation and reopening the restaurant, Peter was forced to keep the windows closed due to dust and noise from the construction. Although this constituted a nuance for Peter, Linda would argue that it is not significant since the business can still operate normally under the conditions with the windows closed. Additionally, the lease states that Peter has the common right to access and the common use to the parking lot. Peter will likely argue that the door in the back of the building is the door commonly used since the parking lot is in the rear. He will argue that an infringment on that area of the building is a breech of the lease. However, because the building has multiple entrances and which entrance is to be used by Peter's business is not explicitly stated in the terms, Linda will likely argue that Peter and his customers still have access to the front door which is common to all and she would cite the Reste Realty case as an example of a common entrance not necessarily being the most conveinent entrance for business owners. Finally, the term of the lease provides Peter with one dedicated parking spot. The long lasting construction slightly impedes his dedicated spot. Although, Peter can still use the spot the construction equipment does cross over the line into his spot. Peter can argue that even though this could be considered a partial eviction from the normal use of what is deternined in his lease that a partial eviciton could equal a complete eviction citing the ""wall case"" in which a brick wall only impeded on the property by a few feet, but the tenant was allowed to break the lease. Linda would likely, counter that Peter did not bring this specific issue to her attention and that all of Peter's complaints have been about general construction around the building. If this specific point was brought to Linda she likely could remedy it in a reasonable timeframe by having the construction crew move their equipment a short distance away. Peter has expressed his concerns to Linda in repeatedly. He calls her every week. Linda is sympathetic to Peter's concerns and has even deducted $ f his monthly rent for the hassle. However, the construction that was originally scheduled to be completed in days turned into weeks and then to months. Peter would argue that the initial time period Linda gave him to complete the construction was reasonable. Peter even closed his business and took a vacation, however, after his return and the distance away. Peter has expressed his concerns to Linda in repeatedly. He calls her every week. Linda is sympathetic to Peter's concerns and has even deducted $ f his monthly rent for the hassle. However, the construction that was originally scheduled to be completed in days turned into weeks and then to months. Peter would argue that the initial time period Linda gave him to complete the construction was reasonable. Peter even closed his business and took a vacation, however, after his return and the construction was still not done and he began seeing a decrease in customer volume and profits are declining he would argue that the time period is no longer reasonable. Peter would argue that the breech of his CQE is very significant because it is costing hsi business money which is the main reason he is leasing the commercial property. He can undisputedly argue that he has brought his concerns to Linda, which she has even conceded by lowering his rent $100. Peter will argue that the months that the construction is going on has exceeded the reasonable time period for Linda to remedy the problem. However, Peter has not yet left the property for fear that he would still be obligated to pay his rent as agreed to on the lease. The fact that Peter would have to leave the premise has been contested since it is such a burden on the leasee to do so. However, based on this being a commercial lease courts have treated commercial properties in a different light than residential due to the more robust resources a business might have. I would advise Peter that the strongest part of his arguement is ",835,908
d9863d9e-0473-482d-ae21-bcfb05f1753c," The interests that were created by Dana's conveyance are subject to interpritation. Generally speaking, when a conveyance contains conditional language (""but if,"" ""on the condution that""), this creates a FSSCS, which gives a right to re-entry, and power of termination to the grantor (Olivia). Meaning, the grantor would need to pysically come back onto the property to re-take possesion. Unlike a FSSCS, an FSD is created by durational language (""so long as"") which creates a possibility of revorter in the grantor (Olivia), and interest which automatically severs when the conidtion is broken. Unfortunatley in our case, the language is not clear as to which interest is created, specifically, Dana states the words ""provided that,"" and ""so long as"" in the same conveyance as relating to Eve's interest. A court looking at this issue would use the rules of construction to figure out which interpritation to follow. The rules of construction of construction favor an FSSCS over and FSD, because under an FSSCS the grantor would need to come and enforce their interest, as opposed to the possibilty of an adverse possesion action with an FSD. Therefore, the court would likely call Eve's interest and FSSCS, giving Olivia (while alive) a right of re-enty/power of termination. If Eve wants, she may use the Marenholz (""house not to be sold"") case to argue for a prefercnce for an FSD over an FSSCS, but, the Marenholz case is considered an exception and this argument isn't likely to be successful. The argument that Eve could make (for solicitation) is that she has right to solict offers to the land under an FSSCS interpriation give that Fiona never came and exercise her power of termination/right of re- entry. The basis that Fiona has is that she would need to argue for an FSD, which Eve violated, given that she tried to sell the property. Fiona in this case, under a possibility of reverter, as the heir of Olivia's property (at issue) would reviece the property back automoatically at the happening of this event, and if Eve stays she would become an adverse possesor. She could hold Eve liable under the doctine of affrimative or permissiv waste which state you should not damage the property, and you should fix monr issues if possible, respectively. "," Peter has a term of years (five year sin our case) given that there is designated stat/end date in the lease. A term of years is createds upon express agreement, and is terminated upon the end of the lease date (Jan 1, 2023) in our case. A tenant who breaks a term of years technically owes a LL for rent for the entuire period of his lease, and the LL can sue the tenant for this back rent. As an attorney, I would advise peter that he has several options. First, we can look to the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The CQE provides that a tenant has a right to ""quietly enjoy"" a premises while they occupy it. There are three breaches to the CQE (and to hold the LL liable, the bereaches need to be by the LL or by someone conected to them). The are the following: actual-partial eviction, contruction eviction, and interference not rising to the level of any one of these, but still significant interference, for which the tenant could recieve compensnatory damages. In the case that there is a constructive evection, or a acual-partial eviction, the tenant has the right to abate the rent. However, in the case of constructive evection the tenant would need to give the landlord a reasnable amount of time to fix the issue, and they would need to abandon the premises. In our case specifically, we can first look towards the echo consulting case for guidance. In that case, similar to ours, there was construction that blocked the use of a common parking lot, and that make the use of a rear door uncomftorable. In that case, the court held that the nuesence did not constitute a constructive eveiction, but nonetheless, it would still entitle the tenants to compensatory damages. When there are only compensatoy damages, it does not seem that a tenant would have the right to abate the rent. So, at the very least, I would advice Peter that if he sues, he has a solid case for compensatory damages. Additionally, we can look towards the brick wall case. This case, whioch talked about a brick walk being built that encroached on several feet of the land, illustrated the principle that under the CQE, any partial-eviction constutues an eviction from the entire land. In that instance, the tenant can abate the entire rent. Per the facts, we know that the construction equipement encroaches a little on his Peters parking space. We could look to the brick wall case to support the theory that peter has been evicted rent. However, Linda may argue that he can still from his entire property, and that he can now abate3 the use the parking spot fully, even if its a tight-squeeze, and therefore he has not been partially-evicted and he cannot abate the rent. being built that encroached on several feet of the land, illustrated the principle that under the CQE, any partial-eviction constutues an eviction from the entire land.

However, Linda may argue that he can still use the parking spot fully, even if its a tight-squeeze, and therefore he has not been partially-evicted and he cannot abate the rent. It is unlikely that the case would rise to the level of construction eviction, as in the reaste reality, case but it is possible. For constructive evection to hold, a tenant would need be so deprived by interference, that it would be as if they were actually evicted. In reaste reaility, the flooding case, there was constant flooding which prevented the tenant from ejoying the promise. Additionally, the latter LL would ignore the calls of the tenant to fix the issue, which eventually entitled her to abate the rent, and anbanden the property. In our case, Peter could argue that the breach constitutes a CE given the noise, dust, construction, intereference to his buisness etc. However, Linda could argue that while there is interference, it does not reach the level of CE since peter can still technically use property. I mean, afterall, he's tolerated it for month. Peter has certainly met his side of the obligation by asking the LL to fix the issues, and giving he alot of time to fix it. But at the same time, the term ""reasnable"" as realting to time, may be construed by the court in various ways. If Linda is doing everything in her power to fix the problem, what is reasnable? As such, my advice to peter, up to this point, would be that he could argue a breach of CQE, specifically partial-evection, which may fetch him damages. Aditionally, he could argue CE, but this would be an uphill battle - so abondoning the property in the hopes that he can abate rent may be rather risky. \ One last hail-mary he could argue is the breach of the Implied warranty of habitibility. Today, LL's are expected to furnish the tenants with a package of goods when renting, not just property. As such, Tenants are entitled to basic, standard, healthy, habiitable living conditions. A violation of this usually comes about due to health code violations. As with the slum LL case, where we saw raw sewage, and plaster falling off the walls, Peter could argue there were health violaltion with the dust. If this is fouind is the tenant has several remidies: abate rent while issue 5 being fixed (but must still give reanable time to fix), fix issues himself and deduce cost from rent, or he could even get compensatory or puntive damages in the caseof wantol/willful conduct. The tentnat does not need to abandon the property to expected to furnish the tenants with a package of goods when renting, not just property.

The tentnat does not need to abandon the property to take advantage of this doctrine. Linda would clearly argue that the situation in our case jsut doesnt rise to this level, there are no serious health violation, or problems with the property's integrity itself, and as such, it doesn't rise to a violaiton of the IWH.

f1a855a4-dfef-48b6-99bc-b5e2324ce2fc," Question 1 Dana's Conveyance In the present case Dana likely wrote her own conveyance without consulting a lawyer which resulted in an ambiguous conveyance. In the White v Brown where the original owner specified that her ""house is not to be sold,"" the majority ruled that the ambiguity in a conveyance would require that the conveyance be treated as a fee simple absolute, and to disregard the additional language restricting the sale. The dissenting opinion however, argued that since the property was conveyed with such clear language as to a restriction, that the conveyance should be treated as a Fee simple determinable with the restriction on attempting to sell the house. There is no condition set in the language that Eve must live at Blackacre, only that she not attempt to sell the property. However, if the court was to look to the intent of the grantor, like the dissent opinion in white v brown, the intent of the conveyance was that she wanted the property to stay in the family and that she would ""like her cousin eve to live on the property."" The main fork in nterpretation of this conveyance lies on whether this is meant to be a FSD where Eve cannot sell the property, or a FSSCS where Dana wishes for her family to continuously live on the property. The differnces in interpretation will be determined if the court uses the actual language of the conveyance(majority opinion of White v Brown), or uses the intent of the conveyance(dissent of white v brown). For ambiguously worded conveyances, courts will tend to favor interpreting as a FSA conveyances. The policy rationale here is to discourage the self creation of conveyances which, when using laguage that is not precise, can cause unnecessary and excessive court cases. The dissenting opinion, however, would be helpful for Eve's arguments. The dissenting opinion argues that the courts should follow the express intent of the conveyance. Here, Dana wants the property to stay in the family and does not want the property to be sold, specifically stating that it should not be sold. Following the reasoning of the dissent, the court may find that the conveyance was intended to be a Fee Simple Determinable with a Possibility of Reverter(FSDPOR). If this were the case, Eve's attempt to sell the house would engage The policy rationale here is to discourage the self creation of conveyances which, when using laguage that is not precise, can cause unnecessary and excessive court cases. The dissenting opinion, however, would be helpful for Eve's arguments. The dissenting opinion argues that the courts should follow the express intent of the conveyance.

Following the reasoning of the dissent, the court may find that the conveyance was intended to be a Fee Simple Determinable with a Possibility of Reverter(FSDPOR). If this were the case, Eve's attempt to sell the house would engage the reversion to Dana and Dana's estate. The posibilty of reverter would automatically revert the property to Dana and Dana's estate if the restricted condition (attempting to sell the house) is met. Alternatively, if the conveyance is interpreted as a FSSCS, the condition subsequent being the attempted sale of Blackacre, Dana and Dana's estate would be granted a Right of Reentry unpon violation of the terms(when Eve abandoned the property). Additionally, the courts would want to look to the Marenholz(school case) case due to the language of the property. In Marenholz, the court held that the use of the word ""only"" was ambiguous since it did not provide a finite amount of time of enforcability. The court there held that the language should be treated as a Fee simple determinable rather than a Fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Here there is a similar abiguity which would result in the court finding that the conveyance to Eve was a Fee Simple Determinable with a possibility of reverted. -Restatement of Conveyance The conveyance restated would be, Dana conveys Blackacre to Eve in fee simple determinable, on the condition that she not attempt to or actually sell the house, if she does, then the possibility of reverter to Dana or Dana's estate. In this restatement, it is more clear that Dana intends for her family to live on Blackacre, and that if the family should attempt to sell Blackacre, Blackacre will revert back to Dana. Following the rationale of ensuring that he conveyance follows the grantor's intent. Eve Solicit Offers Eve can argue that she has the right to solicit offers to sell the property because, although the conveyance stated that she is not to sell the house, common law restricts alienability of property. The restriction of future interests, alienability, is addressed in the marenholz case. The ambiguous language (only)found that the property conveyance should 3beoftreated 9 as a FSD. The courts will likely find that, if eve is the rightful owner of Blackacre in FSA, then she has the right to Eve Solicit Offers Eve can argue that she has the right to solicit offers to sell the property because, although the conveyance stated that she is not to sell the house, common law restricts alienability of property. The restriction of future interests, alienability, is addressed in the marenholz case. The ambiguous language (only)found that the property conveyance should be treated as a FSD. The courts will likely find that, if eve is the rightful owner of Blackacre in FSA, then she has the right to entertain offers from potential buyers. This interpretation likely hinges on the interpretation of the ambiguous conveyance as an FSA. Additionally, if there courts were to agree that Eve could enteratin offers from buyers then they will reason that the court does not want to limit commerce. However, that is all contingent on Fiona not having a future interest in the property. Reclaiming ownership / respnsible for repairs -Reclaiming Ownership Assuming the property was conveyed properly to Eve, the property was conveyed as a FSDPOR. The possibility of reverter would mean that there is an implied future interest in the property to Fiona. The property was conveyed to to Eve as a Fee simple determinable to a posibility of reverter to fiona(eve's estate), if the Eve attempted to sell the property. Alternatively, there is a way for Fiona to pursue the ownership rights from Eve. If the property reverted back to Dana and Dana's estate when Eve vacated the property, Fiona is able to use the laws of New Suffolk and how intestate property is distributed. Dana's will specified that all of her personal property is to be willed to Fiona, however there was no part addressing any real property. Intestate property is will to issue, then ancestors, then collateral in priority standings. If the courts are to follow Dana's intent to have her family live on Blackacre, once Eve abandoned the property it would grant Fiona the -Repairs Fiona's strongest claim for holding Eve accountable for the damages to the property are under the arguments of waste.There are four categories of waste: affirmative waste, permissive waste, econimic waste and ameleoritve waste.

Eve can counter argue the affirmative waste argument by arguing that the damages due to the weather and natural aging of the property. Seasonal wear and tear is very common in cold climates like New Suffolk, and the house itself is at least 40 years old as it was Dana's parents. Permissive waste is when a property deteriorates in value due to neglect. Although Eve has ensured the property taxes are paid, by locking the property and effectively abandoning the property Eve is no longer maintaining the property and is acting negligently. Any house requires constant supervision to ensure that it does not fall into disrepair, and especially in cold climates, like New Suffolk, houses need to be winterized to prevent additional damages. The rationale against negligent waste is to ensure the properties do not fall into disrepair because they have been effectively abandoned by their true owner. The third type of waste, economic waste, Eve could argue that Blackacre, in its current state of disrepair is not being used at its most economically beneficial. The property, in a prime location in New Suffolk, has tremendous value but is vacant. To prevent economic waste, the owner should ensure that the property is lived in or leased. Fiona is a viable owner and or renter who desires to live in the property. The developer may have more economically beneficial plans for the property, without knowing the details of the proposed plan or neighborhood, it is difficult to know what is the most economically beneficial use of the land. The last kind of waste is ameleorative waste, where the owner has made changes that increase the value. This type of waste does not apply here as the value of the property has increased because of market appreciation, not due to any changes made by Eve. Fiona is likely able to sue Eve for damages to the property. Under most interpretations of the conveyance to Eve, there is a futuer interest in the proeprty which would revent or allow for reentry by interest in the property and is enforcable as an Dana or Dana's estate. This future interest is an actual actual interest. There are three types of damages, nominal corrective and punitive. Nominal acknowledges fault, corrective is to restore lost value, and punitive is to punish the offending party. value.

Nominal acknowledges fault, corrective is to restore lost value, and punitive is to punish the offending party. Since Fiona was not emotionally attached to Blackacre, she is unlikely able to claim punitive damages. However, since Fiona does have a future interest in the property and there is a clear channels for fiona to pursue corrective damages "," Question 2 Peter has come with hthe issue of his lease. Peter has several point he can argue to leave his lease due to construction Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment -Constructive Eviction P can argue that there appears to be a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment through constructive eviction which would allow P to break his lease. The CQE ensures that a tenant, P, is able to enjoy the space undisturbed by the landlord or undisturbed by third parties which could be controled by the LL. Additionally, constructive eviction occurs when the conditions are created are ""as if"" the tenant had been actually evicted. Here, P could argue that because the scaffolding and construction area partially block the access to the rear door, and there for the common use parking lot, the LL is constructively evicting P. Here the lease provides common right of access to both the common use parking lot and one designated parking spot. One must navigate a construction site to enter the rear door for deliveries or customers who park in the rear. A court may find that this constitutes a constructive eviction with a public safety rationale, civilians and delivery drivers should not need to navigate a construction site to access the rear door. Linda can counterargue the constructive eviction claim by citing the lease and prior case law. In the echo consulting case, the facts were very similar. The LL had started construction which resulted in one designated parking spot. One must navigate a construction site to enter the rear door for deliveries or customers who park in the rear. A court may find that this constitutes a constructive eviction with a public safety rationale, civilians and delivery drivers should not need to navigate a construction site to access the rear door. Linda can counterargue the constructive eviction claim by citing the lease and prior case law. In the echo consulting case, the facts were very similar. The LL had started construction which resulted in limiting the tenant from accessing a garage via a preferred access door. The court found that although the construction is inconvenient, the construction does not prevent access and that the lease did not specify use of a specific door. Similarly, the lease here specifies sqft of the floor, and access to the common parking lot and one designated parking spot; P's lease does not specify that the use of the rear door to access the parking spaces. The courts would likely find in favor of LL, rationalizing that although there may be a temporary burden on P, he still has access to the common parking lot. -Partial Actual Eviction P may also bring an argument of partial actual eviction against LL. P's reserved parking spot was partially obstructed by the construction, and L gave P a discount on rent for the first month of construction. Actual partial eviction occurs when the LL or a third party create a an obstruction or change the area leased to the T so that the T can no longer access or use the space as specified in the lease. Like in the wall case, where the LL built a wall that prevented the T from storing carrages, P is partially obstructed from using his parking space due to the construction. The court will likely find that P has been partially actually evicted from his parking space for the weeks and months after the intial month during which LL acknowledged the obstruction and granted a credit to rent.The courts will likely find similarly due to the similar fact patterns, that the rent should be readjusted or the lease should be vacated. LL will counter rgue that since the scaffolding is not a perminant fixture, it does not constitute a constructive eviction. Due to the temporary nature of the scaffolding, and it is likely that a court may find that P has not been constructively evicted. If a court were to find that P has been constructively evicted they will likely hold that the rent should be prorated for the period during construction rather than allowing P to vacate the rent. The rationale being to prevent LL or tenants from abusing their situation to gain an advantage due to temporary inconveniences. find that P has not been constructively evicted. If a court were to find that P has been constructively evicted they will likely hold that the rent should be prorated for the period during construction rather than allowing P to vacate the rent. The rationale being to prevent LL or tenants from abusing their situation to gain an advantage due to temporary inconveniences. Damages P can argue for damages. There are three types of damages: nonimal, corrective and punitive. Nominal damages are damages that acknolwedge wrong doing, corrective damages are damages the provide compensation for loss in value or physical damage and punitive damages are damages that are intended to punish. P has suffered from the partial actual eviction from his parking space, which the LL acknowledged and valued at $100 per month as she credited him for the first month of construction's rent. Additionally, P has lost revenue for period of construction. LL also misrepresentated the anticipated duration of the construction to P, LL originally stated that it would only be a wekk but it stretched into months. P can argue that there are nominal damages for the assignment of blame, damages for his lost revenue, and punitive damages for misrepresentation of the duration of the construction. The Jacque v Steenberg case established that a court pay award punitive damages against a party even when there are no major physical damages present. A court may find similarly here, where the only physical damages are noise and dust but P has lost revenue and constumers as a result. Implied Warranty of Habitabiliy Although a week argument, P could argue that LL is in breach of the IWH. The IWH is typically only used for residential leases, however there may be an exception here. The IWH is implied in all leases that the LL will provide a safe and sanitary environment for the tenant within the leased space. P runs a pizza shop, which since it provide food for the public has a very high standard for sanitation. P could argue that there is a breach of the IWH since the noise from construction and specifically the dust from construction have made the pizza place unsanitary. L would counter this argument since the piza place is not a residence and the IWH is primarily used on residential properties. Conclusion argue that there is a breach of the IWH since the noise from construction and specifically the dust from construction have made the pizza place unsanitary. L would counter this argument since the piza place is not a residence and the IWH is primarily used on residential properties. Conclusion It is unlikely that Peter will be able to break his 5 year lease, however it is likely that P will be able to sue LL for damages. P has suffered a partial actual eviction as well as damages to his revenue which have devalued his pizza place. P can argue for breach of CQE through constructive eviction, however since his lease does not guarantee access through a specific door, it is unlikely that the argument for constructive eviction will succeed.

b0eb6bbe-e2c0-4e56-b868-c68c97fc757c," Interests at the Time of the Conveyance The first issue to adress for the interests in Blackacre is what were the parties' interests at the time of the conveyance. Dana conveyed the property stating, ""I hereby convey Blackacre to my cousin, Eve, provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house. The house is not to be sold."" This conveyance is somewhat ambigious due to the conditional and durational language throughout. If the language ""so long as"" is read as durational the conveyance would likely be percieved as a fee simple determinable (FSD). If however, the court favored the language ""provided that"", the conveyance could be seen as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS). Utilizing a Marenholz analysis in combination with the standard rules of construction for ambigious conveyances, there are several factors that help determine whether a court would pick a FSD or a FSSCS. First, a court could look to the intent of the grantor. In this case it seems clear that Dana did not want the property to be sold, or for Eve to even attempt to sell the property. This could indicate that a FSD is more appropriate because the property would automatically revert to the grantor. Nevertheless, a FSSCS would allow the grantor to re-enter the property and retake their claim, thus still giving Dana a viable option. The second relevent rule of construction for the conveyance is that a FSSCS is to be favored over a FSD. Here, as the conveyance could be read for either, it seems that a court following the rules of construction would find the conveyance to be a FSSCS with a right of re-entry for Dana. Interests After Dana's Death The interests in Blackacre changed slightly after Dana's passing. The primary change was that according to Dana's will, her daughter Fiona inherited all of her personal property. This likely means that Fiona now has the right of re-entry for Eve's FSSCS, or if a court were to find that Eve had a FSD, Fiona would have the possibility of reverter. The condition remains, that if Eve attempts to sell the house, the property either can or will revert to the grantor, in this case Fiona. Should Eve Be Permitted to Solicit Other Offers? The interests in Blackacre changed slightly after Dana's passing. The primary change was that according to Dana's will, her daughter Fiona inherited all of her personal property. This likely means that Fiona now has the right of re-entry for Eve's FSSCS, or if a court were to find that Eve had a FSD, Fiona would have the possibility of reverter. The condition remains, that if Eve attempts to sell the house, the property either can or will revert to the grantor, in this case Fiona. Should Eve Be Permitted to Solicit Other Offers? The first issue to analyze when determining if Eve should be permitted to solicit other offers is, does her conveyance allow this? If, as a court would likely find, Eve has a FSSCS, the triggering of the condition would allow Fiona to walk back onto the property and retake the claim. In this case, the ""trigger"" would be, per Dana's will, ""provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house. The house is not to be sold."" Therfore, if a court was reading the conveyance literally, and in line with the grantor's intent, even the attempt to sell the house by Eve by soliciting other offers would allow fiona to retake her claim, which Fiona seems interested in doing. Further, if a court were to find that Eve owned the property in FSD, and a court read the will literally and in line with the grantor's intent, any attempt to sell the home like soliciting offers would automatically return the property to Fiona, and she could bring a tresspassing claim against Eve if she remained on the property. Finally, if for some reason, a court found that Eve could solicit other offers, Fiona could file a claim to stop her. Like the Arkland case, here, it would be a question of economic value versus family ties. Eve is interested in selling the property because it is worth substantially more than she thought it was due to an appreciation of value. Courts have found that this sudden raise in economic value functions in a circular manner, in that when a large company offers substanital money for a property the value automatically goes up. Fiona wants to keep the house because of sentimental family reasons. Courts have found this to be more persuasive because pieces of land are not do not all carry the sentimental value one in particular may, and thus you cannot go buy a replacement with money. As the court found in Arkland, that economic value should not be the only factor considered when there are multiple interests at stake, a court here would likely find Fiona's ties more substantial. Fiona's Basis for Reclaiming Ownership and Holding Eve Acountable for Repairs: Fiona's basis for recliaming ownership is contingent upon the type of conveyance Eve recieved. As previously stated, it is likely a court would find she had a FSSCS. The issue then is whether Eve violated the condition that she ""does not attempt to sell the house"". Thus far, Eve has only recieved a phone call from a real estate developer offering to buy the house, but if she were to solicit any other interests at stake, a court here would likely find Fiona's ties more substantial.

Thus far, Eve has only recieved a phone call from a real estate developer offering to buy the house, but if she were to solicit any other offers it seems this could be viewed as a violation of the condition, and Fiona could reclaim ownership. Further, Fiona may be able to hold Eve accountable for the repairs even if she was unable to reclaim ownership of the property. Like Woodrick v. Wood where the barn on the property was in severe disrepair and it was determined that if the present owner wanted to tear it down they would have to pay for the almeriorative waste, the missing roof shingles, cracked glass, and other problems could constitute permissive waste. As a future interest holder in the property, Fiona could claim that this amount of disprepair constitutes permissive waste, lowering the value of the property, and that Eve is responsible for the damages. "," Peter's Claim for Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment and Constructive Eviction: The first issue to analyze when determing what legal options Peter has is whether he has a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and thus constructive eviction. The covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) is inherant in a lease and states that a tenant has the right to enjoy the property without interferance from the landlord. If there is a breach of the CQE, it is possible that the tenant has a claim for constructive eviction and may not be liable for the rent owed during the period of breach. In order to have a claim for constructive eviction, a tenant must show that (1) the landlord interfered with the covenant of quiet enjoymnent, (2) the interferance was substantial, (3) the tenant gave notice to the landlord and allowed them a reasonable time to fix the problem, and (4) the tenant must abandon the premises within a reasonable time. Like the Reste realty case where it was a commercial lease, and the tenant did not have access to one of the doors, there was noise and dust, and the parking lot was no longer accessible, here there were very similar conditions. Peter's lease provided him with common right of access to the common parking lot, a designated parking spot, and access to the building. During construction, the backdoor was substantially blocked, his parking spot was slightly blocked, and there was noise and dust. Further, Peter gave his landlord many 6 notifications of the problem, and the construction continued. If a court ruled as Reste Realty did however, Linda (the landlord) would likely prevail. The court would likely find that this interferance was not substantial enough, nor constant tenant did not have access to one of the doors, there was noise and dust, and the parking lot was no longer accessible, here there were very similar conditions. Peter's lease provided him with common right access to the common parking lot, a designated parking spot, and access to the building. During construction, the backdoor was substantially blocked, his parking spot was slightly blocked, and there was noise and dust. Further, Peter gave his landlord many notifications of the problem, and the construction continued. If a court ruled as Reste Realty did however, Linda (the landlord) would likely prevail. The court would likely find that this interferance was not substantial enough, nor constant enough to constitute constructive eviction. Peter still had access to his entire 2000 square feet, a door for access, the common parking lot and most of his parking spot. Linda could also claim that she attempted to respond to Peter's complaints by offering to lower the rent. If a court was ruling according to Reste Realty's reasoning, it would be found that there was no constructive eviction, and Peter is liable for the remainder of the rent. If however, a court analyzed this case using the Echo case, the verdict may favor Peter. In this case, the requirements for constructive eviction remained the same, but the standard for substantial interferance differed. In Echo, there was water intermitantly flooding the basement causing severe problems. The tenant gave notice mutliple times to the landlord, and the landlord did not respond. This prompted the court to find that the interferance did not have to be constant in order to constitute constructive eviction. Here, Peter could claim that the repairs have been going on for months. A court could view this as of greater interferance than the sometimes present water in Echo, promting them to hold that the construction was a substantial interferance that could lead to constructive eviction if the other requirments were met. Courts often hold for constructive eviction because the landlord is in a better position to do repairs than the tenant, and the power disparity between the landlord and tenant is often substantial. Further, Peter gave notice to Linda mutliple times, and while she offered him a small discount on rent, he could claim this was inadequate. i In order to succeed in his claim, Peter would then have to abandon the premises within a reasonable time, like the tenant in Reste. Finally, Peter could claim that he has a claim for eviction because of the obstruction of his parking spot. The court in Smith determined that a wall encroaching on the property by about two feet constituted actual eviction, thus relieving the tenant from paying rent on the whole property. This was because the court reasoned that the tenant was paying rent for the whole property, and any interferance relieved them of this duty. Here, construction equipment encroached over the white line into his space. While he could still park, it is a tight squeeze. Though it is not a particularly strong claim, Peter could attempt to say that because he has been evicted from a portion of the space he pays for, he is not liable to pay for any of the rent.

Though it is not a particularly strong claim, Peter could attempt to say that because he has been evicted from a portion of the space he pays for, he is not liable to pay for any of the rent. Peter's Claim for Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability It is unlikely that Peter could make a claim for a breach of the implied warranty of habitability. This is typically reserved for residential purposes, and requires a violation of housing codes. Thus a court would be unlikely to find Peter's case was a violation. Will Peter be Liable for Remainder of Rent if he Leaves? The next issue to adress is whether Peter is liable for the remainder of the rent if he leaves. Peter's current lease is a term of years that runs until December, 2023. He is liable for this rent unless there is a constructive eviction claim. If as previously stated, Peter was able to prove that there was constructive eviction, he would likely not be liable for the remainder of the rent. If however, Peter did not have a claim for constructive eviction, and he left anyway, he could be found liable for the remainder of the rent on the lease. This is one reason a claim for constructive eviction is risky. A tenant may abandon the property, have to pay for a new lease, and still be found liable to pay the remainder of the rent. This is why a reasonable lawyer would inform their client that they should put money in a savings acount in case this occurs. Should Peter be put in such a position, the landlord still has a duty to mitigate the damages per Sommer v. Kridel. This means that after Peter moved out, the landlord would have a duty to attempt to lease out the space and recieve the rent they would have recieved from Peter. ",1137,1218
a6f29834-7a4e-4947-a2f0-3daeb1b23284," Question 1: Interpretation of the conveyance: Dana's conveyance in 2010 had created various ambigouties that require the applications of rules of construction and the case law (eg Brown vs White; Mauren holtz) to decide whether Dana conveyed Blackacre to Eve Life estate (LE), Fee simple absolute (FSA), or Fee simple determinable (FSD) or Fee Simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) and secondly, whether Dana violated the condition ""the house is not to be sold"" thus gave rise to Fiona's reclaim the ownership since she was Dana's issue. First, the rule of constrution require the court to: avoid alienability, partial intestacy; favor FSA over LE; favor FSSCS over FSD; focus on the intent of the grantor upon writing the conveyance; reading the conveyance as a whole. Next, The FSD require the wording of durational and gave possibility of reverter to the grantor. Last, the FSSCS require the wording of condition and gave power of termination/ right of entry to the grantor. The wording of the conveyance lack of the term ""for life"" so Eve could argue just like the Brown vs White and under the rule of construction where the court discourage the restrain of alienability, here Dana intended to conveyed Fee Simple Absolute to her and thus Fiona won't have a reversion back since FSA is the champion of state. On the contrary, FIona can rely on the second sentence which the wording had the term ""provided that"" indicate for condition thus Eve's interest would be FSSCS in which Fiona should have the right of entry to reclaim the ownership as Dana's heir within SOL (10 years). On the contrary, Fiona can also argue that this would be FSD because the wording ""so long as"" was durational should entitled her with the possibility of reverter thus she would be the owner of Blackacre at the time Eve attempted to sell the house. Either way, assuming there would be no statute prefer FSD over FSSCS, the common law should apply the rule of construction which favor FSSCS over FSD thus grant Fiona the right of entry to claim the property when Eve attempted to sell the house, which violate the condition written on the conveyance just like in the Mauren Holtz case. However, the ambigiouty of the conveyance started when we try2 to identify attempt to sell the house. Assuming Eve had a FFCS or FSD which favor the claim of Fiona, even then, the fact that Eve receives a phone call did not prove that she attempt to sell the house. Blackacre at the time Eve attempted to sell the house. Either way, assuming there would be no statute prefer FSD over FSSCS, the common law should apply the rule of construction which favor FSSCS over FSD thus grant Fiona the right of entry to claim the property when Eve attempted to sell the house, which violate the condition written on the conveyance just like in the Mauren Holtz case. However, the ambigiouty of the conveyance started when we try to identify attempt to sell the house. Assuming Eve had a FFCS or FSD which favor the claim of Fiona, even then, the fact that Eve receives a phone call did not prove that she attempt to sell the house. victory to Olivia. However, due to the overwhelming proffs of condition/ duration language in the conveyance, the best argument Olivia can make is Dana was trying to make a defeasible life estate and in situation the condition was violated the interest would be reversed back to the grantor and their heir (namely FIona who already inhereted her personal belongings). Fiona's basis for reclaiming ownership: As discussed above, Fiona can rely on the FSSCS and FSD to recover her ownership. Additionally, Fiona can rely on the rule of construction, in which to conclude that Dana's intend upon the conveyance was to keep Blackacre in her family. Therefore, the fact that Eve locks the the house and moves to Florida went against the original intent of the grantor thus the interest should be reversed back to the grantor thereto. In the situation where Eve was a life tenant, the common law also requires Eve not to commit waste such as permissive waste; affirmative waste; or ameliorative waste. Therefore, when Fiona left the roof singles missing, cracked glass and other serious problem. First, they can both be classified either her neglecting in keeping Blackacre in good shape thus committted permissive waste or her voluntary acted to caused damage to Blackacre thus committed affirmative waste. Fiona should rely on the doctrine of waste to sue Eve to recover the damages, or require the court to issue injunctive relief to force Eve not to commit the waste again because such waste prevent the future interest holder (Fiona) to have Blackacre in the future in the original condition. The ameliorative waste did not exist here since the fact did not state any of Eve's act that could potentially increase the value of the Blackacre. On the other hand, Eve can arue that these issues did not result from her action but due to New Suffolk weather being so harsful and unpleasantly cold. Also, Fiona could claim that Eve committed economic wastes when she intended to sell the house. Just like Baker vs. Weedon, here the amount is ""way more than Eve thought the property was worth"" does not mean the Blackacre won't go up anymore (eg a high way or shopping was built nearby). Hence, the selling the property now can seriously damage Eve's future interest and the court in this situation may did not state any of Eve's act that could potentially increase the value of the Blackacre. On the other hand, Eve can arue that these issues did not result from her action but due to New Suffolk weather being so harsful and unpleasantly cold. Also, Fiona could claim that Eve committed economic wastes when she intended to sell the house. Just like Baker vs. Weedon, here the amount is ""way more than Eve thought the property was worth"" does not mean the Blackacre won't go up anymore (eg a high way or shopping was built nearby). Hence, the selling the property now can seriously damage Eve's future interest and the court in this situation may order to sell part of the property if Eve was in financial hardship like Anna in that case. Otherwise, the fact might suggest Fiona had a better claim and she can argue that Blackacre should not be sold to preserve the interest of both parties. The staggering amount that Eve thought it was the best price to Blackacre might be a small portion of the value of Blackacre when Fiona receive in the future. Also, it is worth noting that the conveyance did not speficify the way Blackacre to be distributed in case Eve violated the condition/ or the condition happen. It should be interpreted as the grantor got the FSA by reversion. Here, Dana passed away therefore her closest issue, Fiona should inherit that interest just like in Marenholtz case. Fiona's basis for selling Blackacre: As discussed above, Fiona should rely on the ambigouty of the conveyance to argue that she had FSA then she can freely liquidate the property. Next, she could rely on the SOL 10 years. Her second best argument should be Eve never had violated the attempt to sell. This was the unilateral act that the phone call from the Real estate developer thus should not be interpreted that way. Thirdly, Eve could argue that if it was FSD, then Eve could wait for one more year (2010-2019) and then the power of reverter of Fiona would be lapsed and then Eve could quiet the title by adverse possession. (As she lived in Blackacre for 9 years already, if moving away to Floriday still count) It would be a stretch but Eve could try to prove her living on Blackacre was: Continuous, Hostility and under the claim of right, actual, notorious and open, and exclusive. Eve could argue that the conveyance was defective so she never received the permission or used the Blackacre jointly with the owner thus satisfied exclusive. Assuming in 2011 she brought the claim thus satisfy the continuous element. However, Fiona can then argue that the continous was disrupted when Eve moves to Flordia after 2014. Eve can argue she still paid taxes and thus still satisfy the purpose of Blackacre just like in Kunto. It seems the actual is the weakest element since Eve left the premises in serious problems and Fiona can notorious rely on this to attack this element. The last element, 9 and open, seems satisfied since Eve paid taxes on auto-pay, enjoys living in Blackacre several years so her living should put Fiona or Dana on notice (assuming the conveyance was defective). satisfied exclusive. Assuming in 2011 she brought the claim thus satisfy the continuous element. However, Fiona can then argue that the continous was disrupted when Eve moves to Flordia after 2014. Eve can argue she still paid taxes and thus still satisfy the purpose of Blackacre just like in Kunto.

The last element, notorious and open, seems satisfied since Eve paid taxes on auto-pay, enjoys living in Blackacre several years so her living should put Fiona or Dana on notice (assuming the conveyance was defective). Policy rationale: The court should hold for Fiona because that holding will keep the consistency of rules of construction where the intent to keep Blackacre in her family of the grantor was kept. On the contrary, Eve could argue based on the rule of construction, the court should gave her FSA because of the restrain of alinability should not be favored. Additionally, Eve can argue that as the wording in the conveyance was favoring the FSD over FSSCS and gave rise to her adverse possession claim. Also, because FIona left Blackacre and live in NYC so many years so the holding for Eve could promote the good use of land, reward the fruit of labor, and the attachment to the land of Eve was stronger than Fiona. Conversely, Fiona can rely on the serious problem to say that Eve committed so many waste and such damages should be reasonable to hold for her as a true owner of Blackacre. Moreover, when reading the conveyance as a whole and rely on the intend of Dana, it was obvious that but for her daughter leaving to NYC, she would have been the true owner of Blackacre. Therefore, the court should give her the possession due to the fairness and certainty. Also, the restrain on selling Blackacre should not be against Eve since for the society as a whole, the liquidity of property would maximize the market value of the property. On the contrary, Fiona's counsel could argue it was not fair to satisfy her future interest and as a result, our society would not benefit from keeping the estate long and stable and thus less tax would be paid. "," As a commercial tenant, it is worth noting that an implied warranty of habitability (IWH) normally would not cover in his condition but to residential premises only. However, in a case where Linda and the constrution breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE). Such implicit enjoyment that entitled Peter with full beneficial enjoyment and use of the leased premises, otherwise he can sue for breach of the covenant and recover the damages. Particularly if 9the situation was so bad and can lead to Construtive eviction, as-if Peter was actually evicted from the premises, he can cease paying rent and terminate the lease altogether.

However, in a case where Linda and the constrution breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE).

Particularly if the situation was so bad and can lead to Construtive eviction, as-if Peter was actually evicted from the premises, he can cease paying rent and terminate the lease altogether. Peter's options: Just like in Echo case where the construction caused noise and hardship to enter the building in the specific entrance, here Linda's repairs to the exterior of the building caused not only the noise but also the dust from outside keep coming if Peter did not close the windows. Additionally, the contractor build scaffolding blocked the access to the rear door, caused difficulties to use the back door for pizza deliveries. Such nuisances resulted in fewer Pizza's customer come to his business. Unsurprisingly, Peter would loose revenue from selling pizzas and his frequent customers will decline. Peter's lease was a 5 years lease, i.e., fixed years lease. Therefore, it will end on December 31, 2023 without requirement of notice, unless Peter would like to renew. If there was no breach of landlord such as CQE or provisions on the lease, Peter should still be held liable for the rest of the lease rent until the term ends. Even if Peter defaulted the lease and vacated the premises before the lease terms ended, that did not terminate the fixed years term and Linda could still sue Peter to collect the balance. Of course, Linda must need to do her efforts to mitigate the damages because under the common law and Krisdel vs. Sommer, she was required to do so. Now, just like the Echo case, Peter can claim that the dusts, the noises, the decline of the customers, the hardship of parking and entering the premises altogether constitutes the breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment. Under the modern approach, Peter should be entitled to full enjoyment of this premise therefore even if this situation did not give rise to the construtive eviction (ie not significant breach to lead to dispossession), Peter can still sue Linda for damages he sufferred (lost revenue). Additionally, distinguished from Echo and more similar with Real Resty case where the flood basement interfered with the Jewellery business to operate their activies. Here, Peter could not use his 2000 squarefeet of floor area efficiently to serve his pizza customers for months and paid $2000 monthly. As the purpose of the leased premises was violated by the affirmative actions of the landlord, namely hiring the contractor to repairs for a lengthy, unfixed amount of time so Peter could raise the Constructive Eviction claim and after notifying Linda the issues, Peter should give her reasonable time to fix then he lead to dispossession), Peter can still sue Linda for damages he sufferred (lost revenue).

As the purpose of the leased premises was violated by the affirmative actions of the landlord, namely hiring the contractor to repairs for a lengthy, unfixed amount of time so Peter could raise the Constructive Eviction claim and after notifying Linda the issues, Peter should give her reasonable time to fix then he need to vacate the premises thereafter. Constructive eviction should allow Peter to cease paying rent and terminate the lease for landlord's wrongdoings. On the contrary, Linda can rely on the facts that these underlying issues were not significant to give rise to CE due to its impermanent nature. On the one hand, the lease dit not specify the entrance therefore ""common right of access"" was not violated. Additionally, Linda can claim that as soon as the repairs was done then all the issues that Peter raised would be gone. Distinguised from Rest Realty case, here the underlying issue should be gone after they finish the construction and they are working on it. Moreover, assuming New Suffolk allow Linda to raise the caveat emptor/ lesse, which was the old doctrine (abolished from other jurisdictions) that allow landlord to deliver the possessiononly and the rent payment duty of Peter would be mutually independent with any issues that relate to the building. However, the modern doctrine overruled that and thus Linda's claim will loose on this ground. Additonally, Peter enter the lease on January 1,2019 and if Linda in-good-faith had a plan of construction ahead and she knew it would affect Peter's business, his purpose of leasing the premises then she breached the modern doctrine of requiring the landlord to disclore any defects or issues of the premises to Peter prior the the lease signed. Linda could argue that it would not be necessary because it was not a building code breach or electricity issue. The facts that his parking spot was encroached by the construction equipment was similar with the Enany, the Boston wagon case so Peter can argue that this encroachment led to partial actual eviction that should terminate the lease thus gave rise to his claim to recover of damages. However, Linda could argue that unlike the brick wall on that case, here the construction document can be moved easily and Peter could use his designated parking spot without issue. In the situation that Peter decided to vacate and default the lease, as set forth under Kridel vs. Sommer, Linda have the duty to mitigate such as posting listing on craiglist, facebook market to try to relet the premises. In the meantime, she could go after Peter to recover the damages. On the other side, Peter 9 can recover the damages with his strongest claim 7ofofbreach of covenent of quiet enjoyment, he could also raise IWH but unfortunately it is not applied to commercial. Nonetheless, Peter can claim that such Peter could use his designated parking spot without issue.

On the other side, Peter can recover the damages with his strongest claim of breach of covenent of quiet enjoyment, he could also raise IWH but unfortunately it is not applied to commercial. Nonetheless, Peter can claim that such issues caused the premises was unhabitatble if Peter lived in the premises. But his argument himself was not strong since IWH was applied for residential. In the situation that lead to Constructive Eviction claim then when Peter vacate the premises he could terminate the lease and recover his damages legally. Conducts of both parties and policy rationale: It seems here that Linda by making open-ended promises that the repairs will last from week to week construct a breach of contract and Peter detrimentally relianced on this. The fact that she is sympathetic was irrelevant since her practice undoubtedly damage Peter's business. Therefore, Peter should argue that the court should reach an equitable relief and ensure the fairness to hold for him. Additionally, Linda was the holder of paramount titlte, better possition to mitigate the damages and richer than Peter thus she should bear the damages. Moreover, those affirmative actions of Linda caused Peter's suffering thus a court should bar that practice from the landlord to keep the informity of jurisdiction across the nation and the history, assuming in Suffolk there was stare decisis to CQE. Lastly, as Peter did not commit any waste and enjoyed his pizza shop until the incident happened, the decision favor to Peter should promote not only the fairness but also the efficiency of business in New Suffolk. Imagine if the court let Linda got away then less and less business would be willing to open there from now. On the contrary, Linda can argue that Peter in bad-faith, just want to terminate the lease for those irrelevant reasons. The lease did not expressly assure the backdoor or the rear door but only ""common right of access thereto"". Also,Therefore, holding her liable for breach of CQE was totally unfair and constituted the abuse of discretion of the court. Just like the Echo case, Peter should be be granted CE and thus still be liable for the rent of the lease term. Also, it is worth noting the fixed years does not require notice of terminating because it ended automatically at December 31,2020. Additionally, Linda could argue that she was sympathetic and very responsive so the court should give her reasonable time rather than allowing Peter to terminate the lease. Such practice was unfriendly to the business and that would impose undue burden on the good landlords. Assuming this practice of the contractor alone to caused the noise and other issues were unique, then Linda should not be held liable for such wrongful practices. She then could go after the contractor and Peter can join the lawsuit. To require notice of terminating because it ended automatically at December 31,2020.

She then could go after the contractor and Peter can join the lawsuit. To summarize this point, it was not fair and not efficient to allow Peter to terminate this lease. What Linda could do is to offer the amount of rent that can potentially offest his damages. $100, as 1/20th the total monthrent was unreasonably small and that would not help Peter to sustain the loss. The strongest policy rational Linda could made on her behalf was that a holding for Peter would alarm other landlords thus the home/ lease insurance will crease due to the increasing risk, the rent would increase thus other commercial tenants would suffer from this practice. Therefore, just like Ghen vs. Rich, the court, bearing in mind of the preserving the custom and incentive for leasing in New Suffolk, should protect Linda's interest and not allow Peter to vacate the premises based on this temporary issues. Last but not least, Peter can used Post and Pierson dissent to back his position because Peter had paid enourmous amount of $2000 per month, all the pizza equipments and furniture and could still stay here but for the violation. As the society as large should promote the fruit of larbor and here Peter although worked extremely hard but now was put in a position of bankgruptcy and loss almost everything. Hence, it is fair to allow Peter to cease the rent, remove his burden and restitute his suffering damages. Moreovern, the constructor acted as Linda's agent therefore it was not unreasonable for him to go after Linda rather the constractor. Additionally, the fact that she kept informing false date of the repairs to be finished constitute the willfunl, wanton practice. Clearly, Peter had addressed these issues and Linda was similar with the slumlord in Hilder vs. Peter, here trying to bait-and-switch him with the belief he might give up. A court should award Peter punitive damages to deter such harmful practice that damage the society morally and economically. ",1855,2085
51373c65-23cf-4027-bf63-ab9c1ce537b4," Essay 1 Dana's Conveyance: Dana's conveyance reads, "" I hereby convey blackacre to my cousin, Eve, - PROVIDED THAT and ONLY SO LONG AS - Eve does not attempt to sell the house. the house is not to be sold. The issue is the ambiguity of the conveyance. The rules of construction generally favor a FSSCS as opposed to an FSD for two reasons. Firstly, in an FSSCS the adverse possession clock does not start ticking right away. Secondly, an FSSCS gives the grantor the right to enter or power of termination only if they choose to do so. An FSSCS is created by condition language such as ""provided that"". an FSD is created by durational language such as ""only so long as."" The conveyance uses both of these terms which is where the issue arises. By using the rules of construction, the court would interpret this conveyance as an FSSCS. However, if the court looked to the holding of Mahreholz v. School Board they may determine the conveyance was an FSD because in that case the court held that an ambiguous conveyance was present and due to the durational language they decided the conveyance was an FSD not an FSSCS. Given that the rules of construction choose an FSSCS over an FSD, is is likely that the court will decide this is an FSSCS. Eve's argument: Eve's argument could be similar to that in White v. Black where the plaintiff felt she should be able to mortgage off the house in order to pay for her expenses. In White v. Brown the court allowed the life tenant to to mortgage the property to supliment her income but she was unable to sell it outright because that would hurt the overall interest of the remaindermen and create economic waste. This case is tricky because Eve has a defeasable life estate. Her interest is not the champion of the property because of a condition subsequent. If the condition were something along the lines of ""To Eve for life provided that my family does not drink on the property"" then her claim to selling the property would be strong because she would not be breaking any conditions. Eve could also point to the highway case where the court found the present interest holder could not sell the land because the future interest holders would lose out on money and this would be economic waste. If Fiona does not agree to sell the property and also does not plan to live there, Eve could argue that she will be committing economic waste because because Eve has a defeasable life estate. Her interest is not the champion of the property because of a condition subsequent. If the condition were something along the lines of ""To Eve for life provided that my family does not drink on the property"" then her claim to selling the property would be strong because she would not be breaking any conditions. Eve could also point to the highway case where the court found the present interest holder could not sell the land because the future interest holders would lose out on money and this would be economic waste. If Fiona does not agree to sell the property and also does not plan to live there, Eve could argue that she will be committing economic waste because she is not getting the full value of the property. While this would be a stretch, Eve does have a stronger interest in the property so the court may consider it. However, given the condition that is present it is unlikely that eve will be able to sell the property. Fiona's basis for reclaiming Blackacre The general rules of construction 3 and 4 generally do not favor partial intestacty and do favor free alienability of property. That being said, the first rule is to look to the intent of party and the 7th is to look at all of the documents as a whole. In this case, Dana left blackacre to Eve with a condition subsequent then left the rest of her personal belongings to Fiona. Although it is ambiguous, an argument could be made if the condition subsequent were broken, then Fiona, acting on behalf of her moms estate, could re-enter and take the property. Fiona would be acting on behalf of her mom's estate because it is not clearly implied who who the executor of the estate is so Fiona being would be first in line since she is issue. So Fiona's basis for reclaiming the property, when considering the rules of construction, would be if Eve attempted to sell the property Fiona would have a right of entry or power of termination. This sort of analysis is similar to White v. Brown where the court examined all the documents as a whole and also determined the intent of the original grantor. Here the court would perhaps do the same. Eve may argue however using the dissent from White v. Brown that the conveyance clearly granted a particular interest and thus unless she breaks the condition subsequent then the property is hers. It is likely that the property will remain with Fiona unless she breaks a condition subsequent. Basis for holding Eve Accountable If Fiona had no way of reclaiming blackacre from Eve then she would not be able to hold her accountable for the damages because her interest as the grantor would only be a future right of entry or power of termination. However, If Fiona were able to take the property from Eve then she could hold eve Accountable. Eve could argue that by not managing the property, Fiona committed permissive waste. This is when the current tenant allows the property to fall apart and into disrepair. It is not an Basis for holding Eve Accountable If Fiona had no way of reclaiming blackacre from Eve then she would not be able to hold her accountable for the damages because her interest as the grantor would only be a future right of entry or power of termination. However, If Fiona were able to take the property from Eve then she could hold eve Accountable. Eve could argue that by not managing the property, Fiona committed permissive waste. This is when the current tenant allows the property to fall apart and into disrepair. It is not an action on the tenants part that economically hurts the value of the property but rather inaction. By locking up the property and then leaving it be for Five years, none of the necessary repairs were made on the property and as the current tenant currently in possession of the property this would be Fiona's responsibility. Like in the highway case, you have to be aware of future interest holders and by not caring for the property, Fiona left the property to Eve in worst off condition than it was when it was conveyed to Fiona. Eve could also argue that Fiona commited economic waste by not leasing the property. All she did was let is sit there and pay taxes. At least if Eve had leased the property then someone would have been responsible for taking care of it and keeping up with the property. "," It is apparent that Peter has a term of years lease with Linda. There is a start and end date which does mean based on the contract alone he is not able to leave before 12/31/2023. The property has clearly been furnished to him since he was been renewing his lease so his duty in mutuality with this is to pay his rent. However, Peter is experiencing some issues that are becoming problematic for him. The terms of the lease dictate that Peter has common right of entry, common use of the parking lot, and one designated parking spot. He also pays $2,000 a month and all of this is relevant for the issues he is experiencing with his property. These issue falls under the convenant of quiet enjoyment. Under the covenant of Quiet enjoyment, landlords are supposed to furnish the property that is designated with-in the lease to Tenants. Under common law, this was all the Landlord was supposed to do. However, modern approaches hold that while this is a necessary component, landlords must also make sure that tenants have beneficial use of their property. There are three issues that tenants can face all blanketed under the covenant of quiet enjoyment. First is actual eviction, this is when the landlord physically removes the tenant from all or some of the property This was seen in the wall case. Next is constructive eviction which is when the tenants use of the property is substantially interfered with to the point where they are unable to use the property as they intended. For a tenant to be constructively evicted, they must meet four requirements. common law, this was all the Landlord was supposed to do.

Next is constructive eviction which is when the tenants use of the property is substantially interfered with to the point where they are unable to use the property as they intended. For a tenant to be constructively evicted, they must meet four requirements. First the interference must be so substantial. Second, they must give the landlord notice of the issues. Third the tenant must wait a reasobable amount of time for the landlord to fix the issues. Finally, this does not happen, the tenant must leave within a reasonable time. The tenant assumes responsibility here for paying rent if the court deems that they not constructively evicted. These requirements were created by Reste Realty's case. For issues that do not rise to the level of constructive eviction, the court has began offering damages in some cases where there are clearly issues with the property that affect tenant's beneficial use but do not rise to the level of constructive eviction because of their holding in Echo consulting. The issue with the back door and parking lot is that Peter used the back door and parking spot for customers and in order to make sure his deliveries are getting out on time. At the the moment, the door is accesable but Peter and customers must go through a maze of scaffolding. Less customers are dining in because of this and Peter's company is also struggling to make deliveries on time. Peter can try to argue that this is Constructive eviction because his use of the property is substantially interfered with and thus his business is being affected. If this is such a substantial interference, peter has given notice, and he has waited a reasonable amount of time. All he must do is move out. Peter can look to Reste Realty v. Cooper where the court held there was constructive eviction when a basement kept flooding and impacting a companies work. The rational was that although the flooding did not occur regularly, the issue that led to the flooding was permanent. Peter can say that construction was only supposed to be minor and take a week, but now it has been going on for months with no end in sight and thus there is a semblance of permance to it. Linda on the other hand could state that there is a front door and Peter should have customers and his employees gain access through there for the time being. Linda then may in turn state Echo consulting and say that while Peter's use of the property is interfered with, it is not to the point of constructive eviction because of the terms of the lease. Peter's lease states that he has common access to the parking lot and doors. In Echo the lease was similar, and when construction was taking place Echo the common rights of entry5 and parking were affected for everyone. Linda could argue that it is not just Peter being affected by the scaffolding. If the court does side with Linda that there was no constructive eviction Peter may still be entitled to damages like in Echo. There the court should have customers and his employees gain access through there for the time being. Linda then may in turn state Echo consulting and say that while Peter's use of the property is interfered with, it is not to the point of constructive eviction because of the terms of the lease. Peter's lease states that he has common access to the parking lot and doors. In Echo the lease was similar, and when construction was taking place Echo the common rights of entry and parking were affected for everyone. Linda could argue that it is not just Peter being affected by the scaffolding. If the court does side with Linda that there was no constructive eviction Peter may still be entitled to damages like in Echo. There the court awareded damages because although the interference was not substantial it still deprived the tenant of beneficial use of the property. Thus peter would have to show that the scaffolding was substantially interfereing with his use of the property because he was unable to run his business effectively for a constructive eviction claim. Linda however, could say that Peter had waited months and dealt with the construction and by doing so he waved his right to constructive eviction. If this is the case then Peter would be entitled to damages at the most. The issue of peters parking spot encroaching on his wall could be peters best argument for getting out of the lease. In the wall case, the court deemed that a landlord had evicted a tenant by building a wall onto property the tenant was renting. The court reasoned this was an eviction because a tenant is paying for the entirity of the land. Even if you do not use specific parts of the land you are still paying for them and should be able to use them to your benefit if you choose to do so. The court then made the rule that the tenant can leave the property and no longer be responsible for rent or if they chose to do so they could renegotiation the terms of the lease with the landlord. By having scaffolding in his parking spot, because could say he is being subject to a partial actual eviction. The parking spot was designated to him in the lease. That means just like the 2000 sq. feet of the shop it is his to have and to benefit from. By encroaching on his space, Peter is paying for something he is not using. Linda could counter this argument by saying that she had this in mind when she decreased Peters rent from $2000 to $1900 per month. She could say that the two agreed to this because she was aware of the scaffolding. Also, linda could try to make the claim that she was not the one who constructed the scaffolding and thus she is not responsible for the actual partial eviction. Peter would counter this by saying that Linda is the landlord and she hired the construction company so she is responsible. If peter does leave and his constructive eviction claim is unsucessful Peter will still not be on the hook for the rest of the monthly payment neccessarily. Based on the failed marriage case, the landlord has a duty to mitigate the monthly rental payments of tenants who break their lease. In this case, a man was no longer able to afford an apartment when he had a two year lease, rather than re-letting it, the landlord allowed it to sit and even turned down people willing to rent the apartment. By doing so he was landlord and she hired the construction company so she is responsible. If peter does leave and his constructive eviction claim is unsucessful Peter will still not be on the hook for the rest of the monthly payment neccessarily. Based on the failed marriage case, the landlord has a duty to mitigate the monthly rental payments of tenants who break their lease. In this case, a man was no longer able to afford an apartment when he had a two year lease, rather than re-letting it, the landlord allowed it to sit and even turned down people willing to rent the apartment. By doing so he was following the traditional rule where a landlord does not have to try to re-let property when a tenant moves out while still paying rent. However, the court created a modern rule that the landlord must attempt to mitigate costs and do their best to re-let the apartment. The rationale is that property is most beneficial when it is being used by people. Also, it is not right for someone to have to keep paying for something they cannot afford. So if Peter were to leave he would have to keep paying his monthly rent until Linda found a new tenant. Also, Linda must actively seek out people to rent the property either through an agent or on her own. Linda would also have the burden of proof of showing that she was actively trying to rent the property. The burden used to be on the tenant but the court in the failed marriage case reasoned it would be much easier for the landlord to prove they are trying to re-let as opposed to the tenant proving the landlord is not actively trying to re-let the appartment. Linda trying to re-let the apartment could be troublesome provided the construction having no end in sight. Based on this, Peter may want to think twice. Thus, the decision is ulitimatley in Peter's hands. There is a chance he could be entitled to constructive eviction but he takes the risk of leaving and losing the case. If he does however, the Landlord has a duty to try to rent the space. If Peter stays, he can try to re-negotiate the terms of his lease and may also be entitled to damages for not being able to use the property. ",1202,1863
0b4a8297-98e1-4153-bddb-d6562cd5041e," According to Dana both parties seem to have an interest in Blackacre. However, Dana's conveyance to Eve was very ambigious. ""I hereby convey Blackacre to my cousin, Eve, provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to see the house. The house is not to be sold."" Using the words ""provided that"" Dana has created a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. However Dana also uses the terms ""only so long as,"" which creats a fee simple determinable. In the Mahrenholz case, the conveyance was extremely ambigious and the court had to determine wheather the conveyance was an FSD or a FSSCS. This is important because if the conveyance was an FSD it would revert back to the grantor automatically and if it was an FSSCS the rightful owner would have to reenter and claim back Blackacre. The Marenholz case was a unique case because the court ruled against the Rules of Construction, stating that the conveyance was an FSD over FSSCS. Under the rules of construction, the court would likely rule that this was a FSSCS. Since the court rules that this is an FSSCS, the grantor would have to reenter and claim that land, but since Dana is not alive, her issue, Fiona, may be able to, if the court allows, to reclaim the land if Eve tried to sell it, which she did. If the court ruled in favor of Fiona then Fiona would own the property in fee simple absolute. However, that is a far stretch. Eve can make an argument for waste. Economic waste is when the property is not being used for its full economic value. Eve was not aware that Fiona wanted to move in therefore she wanted to put the home into the best use possible since she was not living there anymore. Therefore, when attempting to sell the property, Eve belived that the best interest of both her and FIona was to sell the property. However, due to Fiona's sentimental attachment to the home, she will claim that it is not in the best interest of both of them and this is one of the things the court looks to when deciding if selling the property is the right choice, as seen in the Arkland case. The court would most likely hold off on the sale of the house and make the parties work it out between themselves before issuing a court ordered sale. Also, due to the conditione of the property Fiona may claim that Eve is subject to ameliorative waste. Ameliorative waste is any changes done to the property is considered waste. Due to the condition that cracked glass, and other problems, Fiona can say Eve left the property get to, with the missing shingles, that Eve made substantial changes to the home and that it does not look the way it did before. The court could hold Eve accountable for the damages and order her to bring back the home to the way it was sale of the house and make the parties work it out between themselves before issuing a court ordered sale. Also, due to the conditione of the property Fiona may claim that Eve is subject to ameliorative waste. Ameliorative waste is any changes done to the property is considered waste. Due to the condition that Eve left the property get to, with the missing shingles, cracked glass, and other problems, Fiona can say that Eve made substantial changes to the home and that it does not look the way it did before. The court could hold Eve accountable for the damages and order her to bring back the home to the way it was previously however as seen in the barnyard case, this type of waste is no longer used for a successful claim of waste. In, the barnyard case, the daughter wanted to keep the old barn, however, its econmic value would actually increase without it and the court decided to remove the barn and compensate the daughter. Fiona may have a basis for reclaiming ownership on the fact that Eve attempted to sell the home. Since Eve attempted to sell the home and is thinking of other prospective offers, FIona may claim it due to the wording of the will saying ""my home not to be sold."" Under the rules of construction, the court will look to the grantors intent and Danas intent was for the home not to be sold just like the White v. Brown case. The court looked to the intent of the grantor to see what she preferred to be done with the house. However Eva, can argue that Dana is not there to reclaim the land if under the rules of construction the land was conveyed in a FSSCS, therefore in a couple years, Eve will own the property through adverse possession and be able to do whatever she wants with the property. Fiona's basis for reclaiming the property is not very strong. She can try claiming that through the will she owns Dana's personal property which is inside the home, Eve has no right to sell the home. This is also a far stretch. "," Peter rights, as a tenant, include the covenant to quiet enjoyment (CQE). The covenant to a quiet enjoyment is the right to enjoy your property without intereferance, including of your landlord. In order to claim a breach of CQE by the landlord, the landlord has to either actually/partially evitt or constructively evit a tenant. If the landlord did not do either of those, a tenant can still sue for damages because the interference should not have to get as bad, where the tenant is actually/partially or constructively evicted. Peter can claim actual/partial eviction due to the encroachment of the construction equipment. Like in enjoyment is the right to enjoy your property without intereferance, including of your landlord. In order to claim a breach of CQE by the landlord, the landlord has to either actually/partially evitt or constructively evit a tenant. If the landlord did not do either of those, a tenant can still sue for damages because the interference should not have to get as bad, where the tenant is actually/partially or constructively evicted. Peter can claim actual/partial eviction due to the encroachment of the construction equipment. Like in the Smith v. McNany case, where the landlord built a wall that encroached on part of the tenant's property, here the construction equipment is encroaching onto the parking space of Peter. Peter is entitled to enjoy all of his property since he is paying for all of it. According to the majority rule from the Smith case, Peter is able to stop paying rent completely. However, Linda can argue that the construction equipment is only temporary and will be removed eventually. She can say that the equipment is not nearly as perminant as a wall, like in the Smith case. She can also argue that she has apporitioned the rent, deducting $100, in order to compensate for the encroachment , just like the minority opinion in the Smith case. However, since that was the minority opinion, the court may still rule in favor of the majority and say that Peter has a right to enjoy evey inch of his porperty and he shouldn't have to be responsible for any rent left on his lease. Also, Peter can claim partial eviction, due to the rear entrance being harder to access. Although in theory people can access the back door, in practice it is hard to do so. In the Echo case, the employees couldnt use the back door either and the court ruled that it was temporary and not sufficient enough to be considered as partial eviciton. Here, Linda can argue that even though it is harder to access the door, there is still actual access. The court may grant Peter damages, but this would be a far stretch. However, Peter can claim that he has been constructively evicted (CE). Constructive eviction is when there is a substantial interference, that has been previously reported to the landlord, who was given enough time to fix the issue. CE usually also requires the tenant to vacate the premises. In the Reste Realty case, the flooding was a substantial interference with the tenant's business and the court ruled in favor of the tenant. Here, due to the noisiness, the continously closed windows due to dust, the limited access to the pizza place, the late deliveries, and the loss in revenue, it can be considered a substantial interferance. In the Reste Realty case, the flooding was continuous and after notifying the landlord many times, there was still no changes to the conditions. Here, Peter also notified the landlord and continued to call and check up on the status, however the landlord did not fix the problems in a reasonable time. However, Linda may argue that in order to claim constructive eviction, Peter has to vacate the premises. Even though this is a significant factor of CE, the court may agree with Peter that this does constitute as CE, even though he has not vacated the premises, and he is entitled to withhold rent either for the time access to the pizza place, the late deliveries, and the loss in revenue, it can be considered a substantial interferance. In the Reste Realty case, the flooding was continuous and after notifying the landlord many times, there was still no changes to the conditions. Here, Peter also notified the landlord and continued to call and check up on the status, however the landlord did not fix the problems in a reasonable time. However, Linda may argue that in order to claim constructive eviction, Peter has to vacate the premises. Even though this is a significant factor of CE, the court may agree with Peter that this does constitute as CE, even though he has not vacated the premises, and he is entitled to withhold rent either for the time that the construction is still going on or to vacate the premises and withhold rent for the whole term. If Peter cannot claim actual/partial or constructive eviction, at the very least, he'll be entitled to damages. It should not have to get to the point of actual/partial or constructive eviction in order for the court to rule in favor of the tenant. Damages are a way to deter landlords from not providing the quiet enjoyment that tenants are entitled to. Leases in a way are considered as contracts and if the landlord breaches a contract, the tenant should be entitled to some kind of damages. Linda can argue the old rule of caveat emptor, meaning before leasing the property Peter should have inspected it and realized that the property might soon need to be worked on. She can argue that he should have known this would happen and that she is still entitled to the rent. However, this is a very far stretch for Linda becuase when renewing his lease, the construction was not there and under the new rule, the landlord has better knowledge of the property and it would be unfair to punish the tenant for that. Under old rules, Linda can argue that she has no duty to fix the property and no duty to the tenant at all besides providing the porperty. However, under new rules, the tenants have a substantial amount of rights. If Peter decides to leave the premises, the landlord has a duty to mitigate the damages. She will not be able to sue Peter for all of the rent due without fully attempting to relet the property to someone else. Just like in the Sommer v. Kridel case, the court ruled that the landlord has to make sufficient efforts and cannot deny someone who wants to rent the property, just to later sue the former tenant for the unpaid rent. In conclusion, the court will look to the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment to rule for either party. Due to the substantial amount of rights that tenants now have, the court will most likely see that the situation and issues presented do constitute a successful breach of convenant of quiet enjoyment by the landlord, and will rule in favor of Peter.

af76b772-5886-4e53-a62d-e87b17f052c9," Essay 1 The interest created by Dana's ('D') conveyance of Blackacre to Eve ('E') in 2010 is a fee simple subject to condition subsequent ('FSSCS'). The reason being, in the conveyance language we see a conditional language on E's interest (provided that and only... does not attempt to sell the house). Although the conveyance also has durational language following the previously mentioned conditional language (""so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house"") which would turn E's interest into a fee simple determinable ('fsd'), when the document is read altogether along with the last sentence (""the house is not to be sold"") a court could infer that D's intent was that of conditional language and not so much durational. Especially the last sentece renforcing D's wish for the house not to be sold. Although the Mahrenholtz court stated the opposite (favoring a FSD over a FSSCS), that was an exception and courts usually favor FSSCS over FSD. The policy rationale being certainty and fairness for the parties. D's future interest at the time of the conveyance of F's FSSCS, is that of power of termination or right of entry (although not specified in the conveyance) which means D or D's heirs at the time of her death, have the option to act on their rights and claim ownership over blackacre if the condition is broken (F attempts to sell the house). Therefore, as we mentioned above, Fiona ('F') as D's heir at the time of her death in 2014, inherits the future interest of right of entry over Blackacre if the condition is broken, but not before D's death (as the rule says that a living person has no heirs, and thus F only has a hope of inhereting the interest). Since E has a FSSCS present interest over Blackacre under the condition for the house not to be sold (being D's intent in the conveyance as she wanted it to remain in the family), her arguments to be permitted to solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre could be seen as weak. E could argue that due to the condition of the house after years of not being maintained, there's economic waste present because the property's potential is not being used to its full potential and thus she should be able to sell the house. On the other hand, F could argue that under Ark Land (although factually different since there is no tenancy in common here), economic waste is not the only factor to play and also, that there's also permissive waste created by E (she allowed the house to get to this condition). Thus, F should reclaim (being D's intent in the conveyance as she wanted it to remain in the family), her arguments to be permitted to solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre could be seen as weak. E could argue that due to the condition of the house after years of not being maintained, there's economic waste present because the property's potential is not being used to its full potential and thus she should be able to sell the house. On the other hand, F could argue that under Ark Land (although factually different since there is no tenancy in common here), economic waste is not the only factor to play and also, that there's also permissive waste created by E (she allowed the house to get to this condition). Thus, F should reclaim ownership of Blackacre (as we mentioned above, F holds the future interest over Blackacre - right of entry - after D's death). For F to argue that E should be held accountable for the repairs needed on Blackacre, she'd have to argue that because the waste and condition of the house was the result of E's actions (to lock the house and move to FL) then E should be held liable by applying the interpretation of permissive waste under a landlord-tenant ('LL - T') doctrine where F was the LL and E would be held liable as a T because of permissive waste. But, E could also argue that Ark Land does not apply here because of the factual differences and because F did not have any intent to ever own Blackacre (as F told D before the conveyance was made) and thus F has no emotional attachment to the land and should not be allowed to reclaim ownership or forbit E to solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre. F here has a stronger argument when combining her holding of the future interest, D's intent when drafting the conveyance to not sell the house,and the adoption of the Ark Land opinion into this situation, to not allow E to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre and to reclaim ownership. "," Essay 2 Regarding Peter's rights and options in this situation, we look at a breach by the landlord scenario. In this case, a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment ('CQE') is implied on all leases, cannot be waived, and would apply if the following elements are met: there is a substantial interference in the tenant's ('T') ability to enjoy the property, the landlord's ('LL') conduct is causing a substantial interference, the LL is notified of the issue, the LL is given reasonable time to make repairs, the T must vacate the property within reasonable time, and the LL has a duty to mitigate for the damages after the T has abandoned the property. Regarding the element of whether there is a substantial interference, due to the construction in the exterior of the building Peter ('P') can argue that he has experienced a few interferences to his ability to tenant's ('T') ability to enjoy the property, the landlord's ('LL') conduct is causing a substantial interference, the LL is notified of the issue, the LL is given reasonable time to make repairs, the T must vacate the property within reasonable time, and the LL has a duty to mitigate for the damages after the T has abandoned the property. Regarding the element of whether there is a substantial interference, due to the construction in the exterior of the building Peter ('P') can argue that he has experienced a few interferences to his ability to fully enjoy the property he leases: he has to keep the windows closed because of the dust from the construction, the scaffolding built by the contractor largely blockes access to the read door of the property, and the construction equipment slightly encroaches on his designated parking spot. Although Linda ('L' or 'LL' as she is the landlord) would argue that keeping the windows closed and that his parking job is now a tight squeeze are not substantial enough to constitute an intereference for a breach of CQE, P could argue that in addition to the main interference they do. Regarding the main substantial intereference (the blocking of the read door by the scaffolding), P would have a strong argument that this is substantial enough to constitute a substantial interference for a breach of CQE. The reasons being that it is affecting his pizza shop revenue in multiple aspects: less costumers are able to enter the pizza shop from the parking lot, which result in fewer sales, and his staff is not able to make on-time pizza deliveries as they used the rear door for quick access to the parking lot where the delivery car would be. For theses reasons, the first element of a breach of CQE is met. Regarding the second element, the LL's conduct is causing the interference explained above. Because L hired the contractor, she is responsible for the job being done within the time frame she told P. As she first said the contractor estimated a week or so for the repairs to be done, and then it resulted to be a reocurring interference for months, this element is met. In regards to the elements of the LL being notified of the issue and the LL being given a reasonable time to make repairs, P has met both of them. L was notified when the substantial interefences occurred and although she was very sympathetic and estimated only a few more days of the intereference, P gave her days, weeks and months to make repairs and thus meets the previously mentioned elements. Lastly, for a breach of CQE to apply and constitute a valid claim for P, P must vacate the property within a reasonable amount of time. Since he has not yet done so, this doctrine can't apply. But, if P were to vacate the premises even now after months of having the interference, it would still satisfy the ""reasonable amount of time"" factor under the Reste precedent. In this case, the tenant vacated after 9 months of experiencing flooding in T's office through the driveway every time it rained. The Reste court still held that 9 months constituted a reasonable time because the LL kept making promises to fix it. Here, L made promises and provided explanations as to why it was taking so long (as well as deducting Lastly, for a breach of CQE to apply and constitute a valid claim for P, P must vacate the property within a reasonable amount of time. Since he has not yet done so, this doctrine can't apply. But, if P were to vacate the premises even now after months of having the interference, it would still satisfy the ""reasonable amount of time"" factor under the Reste precedent. In this case, the tenant vacated after 9 months of experiencing flooding in T's office through the driveway every time it rained. The Reste court still held that 9 months constituted a reasonable time because the LL kept making promises to fix it. Here, L made promises and provided explanations as to why it was taking so long (as well as deducting $100 from P's monthly rent for the hassle which I'll discuss later briefly) for months so P would meet that time standard to vacate the property. Although it would be risky to vacate the premises in case a court rules no breach of CQE, P could still be advised to vacate the premises and put the money he'd be paying L for rent in a separate account every month just to be covered should it come to that. If P does not believe he can argue a breach of CQE and does not want to vacate, I'd suggest discussing with L a surrender of the property/lease and thus agreeing to break the lease. If L doesn't agree, then P should abandon the premises (thus vacating) and argue for a breach of CQE. Lastly, a court would probably not accept L's argument that P accepted the risks of the interference affecting his shop when he agreed to the $100 deduct from his monthly rent, as the CQE is implied and cannot be waived by a T. Along with this, the rent deduction would put P in a disadvantaged position in comparison to L, since LL are considered to always be in a more advantageous position when it comes to negotiation.

d57e3e5c-10f4-4610-9ea6-49852423ede4," Parties Interests The first issue to discuss is the interests of the parties in Dana's conveyance. Dana conveyed Blackacre to Eve utilizing the langauge ""provided that"" and ""only so long as"". This conveyances demonstrates both conditional and durational language pertaining to the condition of Eve not attempting to sell the house. Their is no third party invovled in this conveyance so accordingly an executory interest is not involved, so if Eve breaks the condition of the conveyance and attempts to sell the house, then it would go back to the grantor. The question is determining if this conveyance demonstrates a fee simple subject to condition subsequent or a fee simple determinable.Unlike in Mahrenholz, where the court ruled that the language demonstrated that the conveayance described a fee simple determinable because of an anlaysis of the conveyance was strongly in favor of durational languge, in this matter, the language is too ambigous, so the rules of construction is the authority we turn to.A fee simple subject to condition subsequent is demonstrated by the conditional language of the conveyance, ""provided that"". A fee simple determinable is demonstrated by the durational language of the conveyance, ""only so long as"". Since as stated this is anambiguous conveyance we must turn to the rules of construction, where one rule states that fee simple subject to conditon subsequent are favored over fee simple determinables, because the courts would rather avoid the automatic forfeiture of land that accompanys a fee simple determinable and the possibility of reverter. So, the estate of Dana, since she has passed away, has a right of entry or power of termination for Blackacre which may be acted upon when and if Eve ever attempts to sell the property. Also, according to the rules of construction, we must look at the intent of the grantor, in this case Dana who wants to keep the house in the family. Since Dana has passed away, Fiona her daughter, now has filled the role of the ""grantor"" of the estate per se, because according to the laws of New Suffolk, any property of a deceased person that has not been distributed by a will, such as the right of entry or power of termination in Blackacre that Dana's estate holds, will be distributed first to issue, which is Fiona. So, Fiona holds a right of entry or power of termination in Blackacre. Eve's Arguements which relate to Waste The next issue is the matter of waste that has occurred to Blackacre and how it relates to its possible per se, because according to the laws of New Suffolk, any property of a deceased person that has not been distributed by a will, such as the right of entry or power of termination in Blackacre that Dana's estate holds, will be distributed first to issue, which is Fiona. So, Fiona holds a right of entry or power of termination in Blackacre. Eve's Arguements which relate to Waste The next issue is the matter of waste that has occurred to Blackacre and how it relates to its possible sale. There are four types of waste, affirmative, permissive, ameliorative and economic. Affirmative waste occurs when a person makes substantial injurious actions towards the property that de-value it. In this case, there is not any evidence of affirmative waste as Eve has not made any of these substantial actions towards the property. The next form of waste is permissive waste, which Eve is definitely at fault for, because with permissive waste, it is a matter of negligence. When Eve moved to Florida she left Blackacre vulnerable to the New Suffolk winters and allowed instances of disrepair, such as missing roof shingles, cracked glass and other serious problems. She did not take reasonable steps to maintain care of the property in her absence, and putting the real-estate taxes on auto pay is not goint to suffice. As an established future interest holder with right of entry, which would lead to a fee simple absolute, Fiona could have a basis for holding Eve accountable for repairs needed on Blackacre, because present possessory interest holders have a duty to not de-value the property through waste. Next, there is ameliorative waste, which occurs when a property holder performs actions towards the property that raise the value of the property. In most jurisidctions today, a claim of ameliorative waste would be rejected, because courts believe that only actions that bring the value of the property down should be considered waste. Unlike in Wood, when the property holder wished to tear down the barn to raise the value of the property, Eve has made no actions to raise the value of the property so ameliorative waste is not an issue in this matter. The final form of waste is economic waste. Economic waste occurs when a property holder does not act when there is a potential economic gain to be made by performing some action towards the property, such as sale. Similarily to Weedon, where the future interest holders wanted to wait to sell the land so that they could get a higher asking price from the highway company, in this matter Fiona, acting as the present possessory holder is considering soliciting offers for the sale of Blackacre from other parties because the amount the real estate agent offered her is a staggering amount due to the house's prime location. Eve could make the argument that3she would be performing economic waste if she were not to act upon this opportunity to sell the land at a prime price. property, such as sale. Similarily to Weedon, where the future interest holders wanted to wait to sell the land so that they could get a higher asking price from the highway company, in this matter Fiona, acting as the present possessory holder is considering soliciting offers for the sale of Blackacre from other parties because the amount the real estate agent offered her is a staggering amount due to the house's prime location. Eve could make the argument that she would be performing economic waste if she were not to act upon this opportunity to sell the land at a prime price. Selling the Land Under the rationale of economic waste, Eve could argue that she should be allowed to consider selling the land. A counter argument that Fiona could make as the right of entry holder is that primarily if Eve does attempt to sell the house, Fiona may exercise her right of entry and go in and re-take Blackacre. Another argument Fiona could make is that economic value is not the only test when it comes to selling property that other individuals have interests in, like Fiona with her right of entry. Like in Ark Land, where the property in dispute had sentimental value for the Caudill heirs, Fiona claims that she has sentimental value towards the property and wants to move back. Fiona could argue that all the rights of the interest holders should be analyzed when looking at if a property should be sold and as an interest holder, Fiona wants to keep the property in the family, following the intent of the original grantor her mother. So in conclusion, Fiona could reclaim ownership if Eve attempts to sell the property under her right of entry and Eve could try to sell the property under the theory of ecomic waste but a court would look towards the interests of Fiona as well and her sentimental value in the property to determine if a sale is appropriate. Fiona mentions that she wishes to move back, but Eve could prevent her from doing so under the property right of exclusion. While Fiona has her right of entry power, if Eve remains in the mere consideration stage of thinking of selling the property, then she will not have reached the level of attempting to sell the property, so Fiona will not be able to exercise her right to re-enter. Like in Jacque, where the property owner sued for punitive damages, Eve can sue if Fiona does trespass on the land. The court system has duty to protect property owner's rights such as Eve so if Fiona does trespass onto the land, the court system may place punitive damages on her to protect Eve's rights and not allow the property right of exclusion to be hollow and unenforceable. Conclusio A quick note about Adverse Possession where the property owner sued for punitive damages, Eve can sue if Fiona does trespass on the land. The court system has duty to protect property owner's rights such as Eve so if Fiona does trespass onto the land, the court system may place punitive damages on her to protect Eve's rights and not allow the property right of exclusion to be hollow and unenforceable. Conclusio A quick note about Adverse Possession The record states that Eve lived on the land with Dana as a child. There is no mention of a time frame of this childhood time spent on Blackacre, making it difficult to pinpoint a time when Eve could ever claim she began to adverse posess, ruingin the continuous element. Also it is stated that Eve returned to the land in 2010 when it was conveyed to her, so there is no evidence from the record of Eve ever living on the land for a time that would meet the first element of adverse possession in this jurisdiction of being there for ten years. Say Eve were to begin an adverse possession after Fiona attempted to exercsie her right to "," Type of Lease The first issue in this matter is to analyze what type of lease does Peter have. Peter has a commerical lease, and he has been renewing a lease since 2007. Currently, he is in a term of years with a lease running from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2023, five years.This is a term of years because the current lease runs from fixed computable calendar dates. While the lease has been repeatedly renewed, that does not make this lesae a tenancy at will, because there is a definite termiantion date of December 31, 2023. Within a term of years, Peter should be notified that if he breaches the lease and vacates the premises before the termination of the the five-years is up, he may be still be liable for the rent that would have been due if he remained as a tenant. Landlord Breach In this matter, since it is a commerical lease, Peter may claim that Linda has broken his covenant of quiet enjoyment. A breach in the covenant of quiet enjoyment occurs when the actions or lack of actions of the landlord, the landlord's agents or one with paramount title has substantially interfered with the tenants beneficial use of the property. A breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment may lead to a partial actual eviction, a constructive eviction or damages. In this case, the construction workers are the agents of Linda the landlord as they are making the repairs on her behalf.

A breach in the covenant of quiet enjoyment occurs when the actions or lack of actions of the landlord, the landlord's agents or one with paramount title has substantially interfered with the tenants beneficial use of the property. A breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment may lead to a partial actual eviction, a constructive eviction or damages. In this case, the construction workers are the agents of Linda the landlord as they are making the repairs on her behalf. The first issue to address is the encroachment of the construction workers equipment on Peter's designated parking spot. A partial actual eviction occurs when any degree of physical encroachment occurs that deprieves the tenant of the total use of the property. Like in the brickwall case,where the constructed wall encroached upon the tenants land up to around two feet, the encroachment of the construction equipment onto his designated parking spot, (it is solely Peter's it is not something he holds in common like the rest of the parking lot),is an encroachment onto Peter's property. Peter could claim partial actual eviction from this encroachment. A policy rationale for this rule is that Peter is paying the whole rent for the whole beneficial use of the property, so him being not allowed to use even absolutely all of it, allows Peter to claim that eviction. A court would most likely agree with Peter, but would possibly order that the lease be renegotiated in order to compensate Peter for the minor encroachment, not relieve him of the entire due rent. The next issue would be that of a constructive eviction. A constructive eviction occurs when the conditions of the property have gotten to the point where the tenant might as well have been evicted, because he is not able to use the property to its beneficial use. What is key about a constructive eviction is that the tenant must vacate the premises in order to claim that a constructive eviction has occurred. Unlike in Reste Reality, where that final rainstorm was a crowning blow, and it pushed the tenant over the edge and forced her to vacate the premises, there is no evidence from the record that Peter has been forced to vacate the premises, so he will most likely not be able to claim constructive eviction. If in the future he does vacate the premises, then the steps he would have to take would be to give notice to Linda of the issues he is facing, which he has done, give her a reasonable time to remedy the issue, which she has by lowering his rent, but that may not be enough. A final aspect of the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is damages. Damages occur when a court deems the extent of the interference has not necessarily reached the level of constructive eviction, in Echo, when the tenant had a similar lease to but it has indeed substantially affected the tenant. Like Peter, it being a commerical lease with common right of access and and a common lot, the court deemed that while there was not a case for a constructive eviction, there was room to expand the rule Linda of the issues he is facing, which he has done, give her a reasonable time to remedy the issue, which she has by lowering his rent, but that may not be enough. A final aspect of the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is damages. Damages occur when a court deems the extent of the interference has not necessarily reached the level of constructive eviction, but it has indeed substantially affected the tenant. Like in Echo, when the tenant had a similar lease to Peter, it being a commerical lease with common right of access and and a common lot, the court deemed that while there was not a case for a constructive eviction, there was room to expand the rule and allow the plaintiff to claim damages. Peter may point to the noise and dust levels of the construction as evidence as well as the amount of difficulty that is involved with using the back door for his customers and his pzza deliveries. While like in Echo it is not impossible to use this common door, it is very difficult. Another factor to look at is the continous nature of the construction. Linda told Peter that the repairs would be done in a week or so, but they have continued for months on end, causing his pizza shop revenuse to go down. A court would most likely allow Peter to claim damages from this longstanding disturbance of the construction and its effect on his business For this issue it must also be noted that Peter would not be able to claim a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, becasue it is not a residential property, but a commerical property, so the IWH, which is narrower in scope, would not apply. A potential argument for Linda is that she has already deducted $100 from Peter's monthly rent for the hassle. A court would have to analyze if this 100 dollar amount is sufficient to encompass what Peter may want for his comibined partial actual eviction and damages. In conclusion, Linda has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment through a partial actual eviction as well as having the construction be continuosuly distirbuing to the point that a court would likely have the rule encompass a claim for damages on Peter's part. Tenant Breach If Peter goes down the path of breaching the lease in some other fashion, the burden shall be on Linda to mitigate any damages she may face from his vacating of the premise. Like in Sommer, where the corut ruled that the landlord must mitigate damages, Linda must take reasonable steps to mitigate damages and find a new tenant by placing ads in the local newspaper or perhaps on craigslist and not treating the first floor of this building as a vacant lot, but as a lot up for rent. The rationale for this rule is that Linda is in a better position to mitigate those damages as she has control of the property.

The rationale for this rule is that Linda is in a better position to mitigate those damages as she has control of the property. Some counter rationale is that is it fair for Linda to have to be forced into a relationship with a new tenant she may not like just to quickly mitigate the damages? Also, if Peter ever has any fear of Linda self-evicting him for some reason, he should be aware she has to evict him through the judicial process. Under the old rule, she may have been able to self-evict him if he was claiming possession adversely to her and she performed the self-eviction peaceabley, but in this case it is not an issue, just soemthing Peter should be aware of.

2c4ed9b0-e2c0-43a3-a413-b34e872fd7e2," Essay 1 Conveyance When a conveyance is ambigous like the one in the fact pattern you must look to the language that was actually specified and keep in mind the rules of construction. Here the conveyance that Dana stated has elements of both the FSSC and a FSD, which is just like the ambigous conveyance in the Marenholz case. The policy rationale that was used to decide the marenholz case was through looking at the intent of the grantor under the rules of construct. Here we have the language provided that, which is clearly condidtion, but then has the limitation language of only so long as. Therefore, the condition that the house not be sold is clearly the intent of the grantor that upon selling the hosue Eve her cousin is not to have the house. This ambiguity is just like the White case in which she had the language ""the house is not to be sold"". There the court looked a the rules of construction and determined an FSA, however the dissenting opinion though otherwise and saw this language and decided that the grantor clearly could make a gift and it was more reliable to look at the intent of the grantor. The language here sounds automatic that upon the violation of the condidtion made it would revert back to the person who holds the future interest because upon Eve attempting to sell the house she would lose interest in Blackacre. At the time of conveyance there is no thrid party so Dana would still hold the future interest as the grantor. Therfore just like the marenholz case and the dissent in the white case, the rule of construction to look at the intent of the grantor will prevail. In which the Conveyance results in A having a Fee Simple Determinable, becuase of the automatic loss of the interest and the language so long as modifying the condition, in which Dana, the grantor would have a possibility of reverter. The policy rationale driving this conclusion is that when there is an ambigous conveyance, we look to the rule sof construction, however the intent of the grantor can override the other rule of construction to favor FSSCS over FSD, just like in the marehholz case. Solicit Offers and Selling the property condition, in which Dana, the grantor would have a possibility of reverter. The policy rationale driving this conclusion is that when there is an ambigous conveyance, we look to the rule sof construction, however the intent of the grantor can override the other rule of construction to favor FSSCS over FSD, just like in the marehholz case. Solicit Offers and Selling the property In this current fact pattern Eve has the abiility to take offers for the potential sale of blackacre due to the economic incentive of how much the land is worth, but is subject to a limitation because there is a future interest holder. This is just like the Weedon case in which the present interest owner wanted to sell the property to gain the proceeds from the sale so she could live comfortably in her old age, but the future interest holders knew the house would be worth more in a few years and wanted to wait so they wouldnt lose out on the economica value in the future. The rational for selling property when there is a future interest is that you have to take into account the interest of all parties economic and sentimental values and factors, that have interest in Blackacre. First, Eve would have to establish that she would have a serious economic gain at that moment in time to sell the property, which we know from the first offer because it was substantial, and that it wouldnt continue to increase value over time, becuase if selling in the moment when the property could increase in value would ulitmately hider the future interest holder. However, If Eve could gain conset from Fiona to sell there would be no limitation on her to sell, because when there are future interest holders in the land all parties need to be consenting to the sale of the land, these would likely be Eve's strongest arguements to hear offers to sell the land. However, we know from the fact pattern that fiona also has emotional and sentimental ties to the property, which is substantial could be justifiable to hault the potential seeking of offers to sell the house. Tenants in common in Arkland, that the people who live on the land have sentimental ties to the property and the court rules that you must value sentimental factors just as much as a economic benefit. Therefore, the assent to selling the propety in unlikely, becuase of hte emotional ties. But, just like the dissent in Arkland, Fiona hasnt been on the property in a long time, so the court could argue that the sentimental ties arent to Blackacre, but moreso to the deceased. Ultimately Eve would have to prove that the economic interest would outweigh the sentimental value, which would likely be Eve''s biggest hinderance. We see a very similar event patter happen in the Weedon case in which the present interest holder wants to sell the land so she can live comfortably in her old age and have immediate relief. However the future interest holders know that the land will be worth a substantial amount more in the of the present holder would severly hinder the future and therefore if sold to satify the immediate3need future interst holder. The rule that comes out of this case is that economic value is not the sole test, and sentimental ties can be just as powerful as economic, therefore we must weight each interest holders to economic interest would outweigh the sentimental value, which would likely be Eve''s biggest hinderance. We see a very similar event patter happen in the Weedon case in which the present interest holder wants to sell the land so she can live comfortably in her old age and have immediate relief. However the future interest holders know that the land will be worth a substantial amount more in the future and therefore if sold to satify the immediate need of the present holder would severly hinder the future interst holder. The rule that comes out of this case is that economic value is not the sole test, and sentimental ties can be just as powerful as economic, therefore we must weight each interest holders to determine. Therfore, Eve would have to argue that the economic value at the present time outweighs Fiona's sentimental value because it is so substantial, or seek approval from fiona to sell the property. The policy rational here is certaintiy throug the land being put to the best use as we dont want to waste land, and equity and fairness to honor the interest of all parties and the value they hold. Repairs. Upon returning to Blackacre Fiona observes that Eve has commited waste to the property during the present interest when she abandoned the property, just like the Woodrick case waste can affect the future intersst holders and in turn can affect how the the present interest holders must maintain Blackacre. The rationale for this is the future interest holders have the right to walk on to Blackacre in the same condition that it was in at the time of conveyance, which is why life tenats are subject to the doctrine of waste, because there is always a future interset holder in the property. Eve has the present interest on the land and has the duty to not commit waste that would affect the land negatively and impact the future interest holders under the modern doctrine. In this case there are roof shingles missing, glass is cracked and there are some serious problems with the house that are unspecified. Under the doctrine of waste, Affirmative waste is anything that affirmatively changes the land and can decrease value, here all of the conditions listed above altered, and assumably decreased the value of Blackacre. Permissive waste is negligence, therefore Eve likely didnt conduct her duty to maintain blackacre outside of normal wear and tear, which would fall on her as negligence. Economic and Ameilorative waste here wouldnt be presenet because any of these conditions would increase the value of the land, nor is the property being put to its best use because of its clear neglect through the conditions, but if ameilorative was present the court could apply the modern way of thought under woodrick case and say it doesnt consitute as waste. Fiona has a strong argument here to hold Eve accountable for the repairs of the house. Just like in the woodrick case where the court looks 9 at waste and how it affects all parties with interest and that the future interest holders have a right to the land in the condition it was in at the time of conveyance besides normal wear and tear. Therefore, fiona would likely be able to hold Eve liable for wouldnt be presenet because any of these conditions would increase the value of the land, nor is the property being put to its best use because of its clear neglect through the conditions, but if ameilorative was present the court could apply the modern way of thought under woodrick case and say it doesnt consitute as waste. Fiona has a strong argument here to hold Eve accountable for the repairs of the house. Just like in the woodrick case where the court looks at waste and how it affects all parties with interest and that the future interest holders have a right to the land in the condition it was in at the time of conveyance besides normal wear and tear. Therefore, fiona would likely be able to hold Eve liable for permissive and affirmative waster for being both negligence and affirmatively changing the land in way that would affect her future interest to the correct condition of Blackacre. The policy rational driving the conclusion is fairness to both parites, and equity to the condition of the land of Blackacre. Reclaim ownership Upon abandoning the premises by locking up and taking offers to sell the house, Fiona could have the right to reclaim blackacre, just like in the white case where if the condition to be sold was violated the present interset holder would be violated. The interest here is that we want to honor the intent of the grantor under the rules of construction. Fionas stongest argument here would be that Eve already violated the clause of attempting to sell the land so she cant sell it. If we assume that Dana granted the rest of her interest in property to Fiona through all of her personal propety interest being willed to Fiona, and at the time of conveyance Dana still had the future interst on the land which would mean that now Fiona had the reverter interest in the land. Therefore, when the condiditon is broken the interest is automatically back to Fiona and isnt Eve's to sell in the first place after attempting to sell through agreeing to listen to the offer which would consistitute as an attempt . However, Fiona's weakest argument is that its ambigous on what the word attempt actually means in the case of violating the condition in the conveyance, does it have to be firmly having an offer, listing it on the marker, or the act of looking into offers? The ambiguity here could detrimentally hinder Fiona's right to re-take Blackacre in this case. However, in the White case the court looks to the rules of construction in order to try to interpret here, and and in the marenholz case they look to it to try to determine what the exact language would mean. Here the court would likely default to the intent of the grantor that under no cirucmstance should the present interst holder attempt to sell the land, in which attempt woudl encompass any sense of selling which would ulitmately be a strength for fiona and a weakness for Eve. The raitonal here is to honor the intent of the grantor when a conveyance5 is of ambigous 9 per the rules of contruction interpret here, and and in the marenholz case they look to it to try to determine what the exact language would mean. Here the court would likely default to the intent of the grantor that under no cirucmstance should the present interst holder attempt to sell the land, in which attempt woudl encompass any sense of selling which would ulitmately be a strength for fiona and a weakness for Eve. The raitonal here is to honor the intent of the grantor when a conveyance is ambigous per the rules of contruction "," ESSAY 2 Strengths for Peter- no liability for rent In the current fact pattern Peter a commerical tenant in a term of years lease, has a experienced a breach of his Covenant of Queit enjoyment by the landlord and is seeking to not be liable for the rest of his lease, just like the tenants in reste realty. The raitonale if that the court is moving away from the caveat lessee and that the modern doctrine holds that the landlord has more dutys to the tenant becuase of the contract like idea of mutual obligation between the parties. The covenant of quite enjoyment happens when a landlord breaches the tenants right to quietly enjoy the property. Here that is just the case, Peter who owns the pizza place now has construction all around him and has suffered an decrease in revenue in the business soley from the direct result of the construct. Therefore, just like in the reste case when the business that tenant was using the space was interefered by the landlords inaction to take care of water interferance the court found a breach in the tenants CQE because the intereference disrupted the tenants use of the space. Under the Convenant of Quiet enjoyment there are three ways that result of a CQE, Actual eviction like the berg v wiley case, partial eviciton like the wall case, and constructive eviction like the reste realty case. Actual eviction isnt present becuase Peter wasnt dispossed of the use of the space, nor was partial eviction present becuase he still could feasibly use all aspect of the property, However, Peter could have a claim here becuase he had expressed right to the parking spot, and if they are partially eviciting him from even a small part of it its like being dispossesed of the whole use of it, just like in the wall case, the rational here is that the whole debt of the rent if for the use of the whole property. However contructive eviction like in the reast and echo case are present here. First the intereference was by the the berg v wiley case, partial eviciton like the wall case, and constructive eviction like the reste realty case. Actual eviction isnt present becuase Peter wasnt dispossed of the use of the space, nor was partial eviction present becuase he still could feasibly use all aspect of the property, However, Peter could have a claim here becuase he had expressed right to the parking spot, and if they are partially eviciting him from even a small part of it its like being dispossesed of the whole use of it, just like in the wall case, the rational here is that the whole debt of the rent if for the use of the whole property. However contructive eviction like in the reast and echo case are present here. First the intereference was by the act or ommision of act by the Landlord, Linda was the one who hired the contractors, Next the breach was substantial just like the reste case. Peter was seeing a big decrease in his business and that his sales were down as result of the construction, therefore hindering business which is the sole use of the space. Additionally because of the construction in the back lot he had trouble making delieverys on time which is essential to the operation of the business. This is just like the water in reste case in which the business owner had to seek alternate ways to conduct her business becuase of the water because she couldnt use the space as she had intented to when she signed the lease. Peter also gave notice to Linda and resonable time to fix the problem. He calls her week over week and she gives him $100 credit for the nusisance, but in realty she takes not affirmative action to fix the problem, she could have asked the construction workers to move the scaffolding so it was easier to walk through or only due construction outside of direct business hours so they wouldnt be in the parking lot or affecting guest experience of the pizza place. All Linda does is explain why repairs are taking so long, which is not a reaonable fix in a reasonable time, just like in the Reste case even though in that case the LLD take no affirmative action to help the tenant but simply leaves the tenant to fair on their own depsite the breach. Finally, it has to be like the tenant has been evicted through actually vacating the premises, which assuming that Peter has called me in a reasonably time of the construction I would adivise him to leave asap, as then he could rightfully leave the term of years lease with not liability. Additionally Peter also has the right to sue for annoyance damages just like in Echo if he doesnt leave. Thus, the parking spot parital eviction, coupled with constructive eviction if peter leaves he would not be liable to pay the rest of his tenancy of years, which otherwise would hold him liable to pay the entire term of the five year lease. The overall policy rational here is moving from the cavett lessee to the modern doctrine that holds landlords responsibel to the CQE and IWH, but here only CQE applies because of the nature of the commerical space. The landlord will always be in a better position than the tenant and we want to protect the tenants right enjoy the use of the space as thats why they are paying rent in the first place. landlords responsibel to the CQE and IWH, but here only CQE applies because of the nature of the commerical space. The landlord will always be in a better position than the tenant and we want to protect the tenants right enjoy the use of the space as thats why they are paying rent in the first place. Weaknesses for Peter- liable for rent In the current scenario Peter wasnt actually, partially, or constructively evicted becuase of the Landlords construction, Just like in the Echo case where the landlord started lengthy construction, the court found that there was constructive eviction becuase the tenant didnt leave, and the breach by the landlord wasnt so substantial, but the plaintiff was awarded damages for the annoyance. The rationale here is even if the breach isnt so substantial we still want the tenant to recover in some way becuase we dont want it to arise to the level that that the tenat would actually have to leave the premises. Peter being a commericial business with a tenacy for years for which if not breached holds the tenant liable to pay until the last day of the lease. Peter still entitled to the Covenant of quiet enjoyment which is the right to enjoy his property, under which is breached why the landlord he could seek remedy. Here there was no actual eviction becuase he still had access to the business. Partial eviction also wasnt present because although the scaffolding was present on the back side of the door the property was still there to be used although it was more difficult. However for constructive eviction the landlord must have breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment, through necessary elements. The breach must be through a LLDs action or ommission to act and be so substantial, the tenant must provide notice to the landlord and give them reasonable time to remedy, and finally the tenant must leave within a reasonable time. Here Linda, the landlord could argue that Peter would still be liable to pay rent to the end of his term of years lease because the interferance wasnt substantial enough. The construction did bring a commotion, but peter was still able to open his business at conduct business almost as usual. the impact was that the back door was made harder to get to through the scaffolding making it harder to deliver pizzas, the noise, and that there is a dip in customers. However, Peter doesnt have exclusive right to just the back door, he could use the front door to deliever pizzas in the interim becuase its expressed in his lease that he had common right to both doors and the parkling lot. Although the parking lot had construction rigs in it he had common right, not exclusive right. Therefore the breach wasnt so substantial. Finally, it wasnt so substanital because Peter didnt leave, to be constructively evicted its as if you were actually evicted, and therefore since he is still operating business he cannot claim constructive eviction, which is ultimately Peters biggest weakness, and Linda's largest strength. Linda was also sympathetic to the response and that there is a dip in customers. However, Peter doesnt have exclusive right to just the back door, he could use the front door to deliever pizzas in the interim becuase its expressed in his lease that he had common right to both doors and the parkling lot. Although the parking lot had construction rigs in it he had common right, not exclusive right. Therefore the breach wasnt so substantial. Finally, it wasnt so substanital because Peter didnt leave, to be constructively evicted its as if you were actually evicted, and therefore since he is still operating business he cannot claim constructive eviction, which is ultimately Peters biggest weakness, and Linda's largest strength. Linda was also sympathetic to the response and took the time to listen to peter give her notice, and as a LLD is actually trying to better the building which arguably is something a tenant would want in the long run. She aslo takes it upon herself to give $100 credit for the hassle, which shows that she is trying to take reasonble steps to remedy the issue for Peter. This is just like in the Echo case in which the facts are almost identical, the court found that because the lease didnt express exclusive right to the use of a specific door, and the ability to use another one couppled wiht not leaving the tenant didnt have a means to claim constructive eviction. The court however finds that the breach must be so substantial to put the tenant in a place where its like being evicted, and thats not the case here. The court does find that the tenant could sue for damages for the annoyances ebcause we dont want the construction to raise to level of constructive eviction which is the expressed policy rational, but Petere ultimately would be liable to the rest of his term of years lease becuase there is not actual, partial or constructive eviction present despite the construction.

b02bfa77-760e-426b-ac53-a1a617a5cf46," Essay 1) The interests conveyed by Diana seem to be ambiguous. Based on the language of the conveyance it is unclear whether Eve is conveyed a fee simple determinable (FSD) or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) given that there is both durational (only so long as) and conditional (provided that) language. To determine what the interests are, common law suggests looking at the Rules of Construction. The Rules of Construction are set of rules that help guide interpret the conveyances. Among them are looking at the intent of the original grantor. It is clear that Dana has history living on blackacre after her parents died and even when she maried her husband and started a family. Given the fact that Eve was almost a second daughter to her as she was like a sister to her own daughter, Fiona, it is clear that she wanted to Eve to make the most use of the property. Here, at the time of conveyance since Dana was alive, it seems that she is intending to retain a reversion in the property, whether it be a possibility of revertor (for FSD) or right of re-entry (for FSSCS). This situation is similar to the White case where the dispute was whether the grantor conveyed a life estate to her sister-in law or a fee simple absolute (FSA), but nonetheless also had a similar provision that indicates ""the house is not to be sold"". In that case, the majority opinion held that the interest holder had a FSA not an abosolute. Despite the retrain, the majority decided to give less weight to the restrain based on policy rationales that prefer the property to be dispossed of its entirety rather than partially. On the other hand, the dissent in the White case did pay close attention to the restraints and reasoned that the grantor would not have put such a restriction unless she intended the conveyance to be a life estate. In light of the dissent and because of the lack of life estate language in Dana's conveyance (different from the White case), it seems clear that Dana wanted to convey either a FSD or FSSCS. Further, given the sentimental attachment to the property, it is clear that Dana did not want the house to be sold, giving more weight to putting a condition or limitation on Eve's use of the property. One of the other rules of construction is to favor a FSSCS over a FSD. Reasons for this being that a FSSCS encourages those with a future interest, what would be a right of re-entry, to not sleep on their property and ensure the property is being used adequately. This is different from the Mahrenholz case wanted to convey either a FSD or FSSCS. Further, given the sentimental attachment to the property, it is clear that Dana did not want the house to be sold, giving more weight to putting a condition or limitation on Eve's use of the property. One of the other rules of construction is to favor a FSSCS over a FSD. Reasons for this being that a FSSCS encourages those with a future interest, what would be a right of re-entry, to not sleep on their property and ensure the property is being used adequately. This is different from the Mahrenholz case where the court favored an FSD over an FSSCS and thus went against the rules of construction. The Illinois court there focused more on the linguistic and theoretical construction of the conveyance rather than the grantors intent. If New Suffolk were to take this interpretation, then it could possibly be argued that Dana did in fact convey a fee simple determinable. However this seems unlikely for sentimental reasons stated above. It is more likely that Eve has a FSSCS and Dana has a right of re-entry. Even further once Dana dies, Fiona, her daughter, inherits all the property and steps in Dana's shoes as a future interest holder with a right of re-entry on the house she grew up in with Eve. Arguments for Eve - Permitted to Solicit other Offers for Sale of Blackacre: Eve's arguments to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre are not likely to succeed. Given her interest in Blackacre now as a FSSCS, she does not have the free alienability to do what she wants with the property. Just like in the Baker v. Weedon case where the life tenant wanted to sell the property sooner than the future interest holders and was not allowed, Eve will probably not be permitted to sell Blackacre if it does not meet the interst of all future interest holders. In this case, Eve would have to either have consent from Fiona to be able to sell the property, yet this does not seem to be the case. A sale of the property as in the Baker case, is deemed possible only if its necessary to meet the interest of all the parties. Given Fiona's reaction when she saw the property, she is hurt and distraught by how Eve treated the place, which showcases her personal and long standing relationship with the property. Evidently, it seems that Fiona has an interest to keep the property. Nonetheless, Eve could counter argue that her long standing relationship with the house should not be valued over the commercial value of Blackacre because she had been living in New York City for the past 9 years. This is similar to the dissent in the Ark Land case where although the parties were tenants in common, the heirs of the 100 year old property only used the property in the summer and the coal mining company wanted to put the property to economic use. The dissent argued that not allowing the coal mining to buy the rest of the shares was in fact economic waste. However since Fiona now wants to move back, this may be a difficult argument for Eve to make. Given policy rationale seen in the Baker case, the legal system does not want to encourage disputes between family members. For that reason, it may be unlikely that Eve is allowed to solicit other offers for sale because she is not respecting the emotional interest of her dissent in the Ark Land case where although the parties were tenants in common, the heirs of the 100 year old property only used the property in the summer and the coal mining company wanted to put the property to economic use. The dissent argued that not allowing the coal mining to buy the rest of the shares was in fact economic waste. However since Fiona now wants to move back, this may be a difficult argument for Eve to make. Given policy rationale seen in the Baker case, the legal system does not want to encourage disputes between family members. For that reason, it may be unlikely that Eve is allowed to solicit other offers for sale because she is not respecting the emotional interest of her ""sister"". If anything, an equitable relief like the court suggested in the Baker case is perhaps to hypothecate the land and then Eve can sell her part of the land. However this may not be possible here because it seems that the property conveyed is just a house and not a 100-acre land. Fiona's Basis of reclaiming ownership of Blackacre or holding Eve accounable for repairs? In addition, because Fiona now has interest in moving back into Blackacre, she could argue that although as a future interest holder with a right of re-entry in the property, she can reclaim ownership of Blackacre because Eve has not successfully adverse possessed the property. To claim adverse possession there are five elements that need to be met: continuous use; hostility; actual use; notorious and open; and exclusive use. Since all the elements need to be met, it is sufficient to fail to claim AP when only one of the elements is not met. In this case, Eve could argue that since Fiona has been in Florida for the past 5 years and only lived on the property for 4 years, she has not met the statute of limitations, which in this jurisdiction is 10 years. As a result, now having confronted Eve on the property at the five-year anniversary of Dana's passing, Fiona could argue that she has successfully asserted her right to re-enter on the property. However because she has not explicitely said so in this situation, Eve could counter argue that she has not asserted her right to re-enter. Further, she could argue that because she still paid real estate taxes on auto-pay, she still used the property for the entire 9 years she was there. Even if this argument would be valid, it unlikely that Eve would pervail because the SOL is 10 years, making her the TO in 2020 if Fiona has not asserted her right to re-enter. Whether or not Fiona has successfully re-asserted her right to re-enter she can hold Eve accountable for repairs. Even a future interest holder, can hold her liable because Eve has committed waste. The three types of waste are Affirmative (voluntary acts that destroy the property); Permissive (acts that stem from neglect and failure to take reasonable care of the property); and Ameliorative (voluntary acts that increase the value of the property). Affirmative waste is not likely to be argued here because Eve did not make any purposeful changes to the property. Fiona's strongest point is to hold Eve liable for permissive waste by her acts to just simply lock the house and not protect the condition of the house. Because her neglect to the care of the property left the roof without some shingles, the glass cracked repairs. Even a future interest holder, can hold her liable because Eve has committed waste. The three types of waste are Affirmative (voluntary acts that destroy the property); Permissive (acts that stem from neglect and failure to take reasonable care of the property); and Ameliorative (voluntary acts that increase the value of the property). Affirmative waste is not likely to be argued here because Eve did not make any purposeful changes to the property. Fiona's strongest point is to hold Eve liable for permissive waste by her acts to just simply lock the house and not protect the condition of the house. Because her neglect to the care of the property left the roof without some shingles, the glass cracked and other serious problems, it is likely that Fiona could hold her liable. One argument that Eve may potentially use is that given the high price she received from the real estate developer, her ""neglect"" to the property actually increased the value of the property. Like in the Woodrick case, where the dispute was regarding the destruction of a barn, and the court went against common law rule that Ameliorative Waste is not waste because it increases the value of the property. However, since the jurisdiction in the woodrick case had a minority view, it does not seem likely that Eve's argument would prevail. One solution could be an equitable relief as in the woodrick case where the opposing interest holder was compensated for the destroyed barn. Here, Eve could sell the property at its high value and compensate Fiona for the value of the house. However, this may be a far stretch given policy rationales that indicate an estate cannot be replaced by money. While the emotional attachment Fiona has to the property could be up for debate as discussed above, because of her interest now in the property, it does not seem likely that paying Fiona would be a fair resolution. "," Peter's Legal Rights and Options It seems that Peter may have some valid claims against Linda (LL) for the construction going around the building he is leasing from. Before getting into details, it is important to note that Peter has a term of years lease because it is for a fixed period of time. Under a term of years lease, no notice is required so it would be important to inform Peter of this. If he really wanted to leave the premises, no notice is required. However, as a tenant, he has the duty to pay rent. If Peter is trying to not pay rent for the remaining five years on his lease, he would have to argue that the landlord breached his duties and thus is not entitled to pay. Given the circumstances, one way that Peter could leave without having to pay is claiming that LL breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) which is implied in all lease. A breach of the CQE can result in either actual/partial eviction, constructive eviction, or at least damages. Given years lease because it is for a fixed period of time. Under a term of years lease, no notice is required so it would be important to inform Peter of this. If he really wanted to leave the premises, no notice is required. However, as a tenant, he has the duty to pay rent. If Peter is trying to not pay rent for the remaining five years on his lease, he would have to argue that the landlord breached his duties and thus is not entitled to pay. Given the circumstances, one way that Peter could leave without having to pay is claiming that LL breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) which is implied in all lease. A breach of the CQE can result in either actual/partial eviction, constructive eviction, or at least damages. Given that Peter is leasing a commercial building, he could not claim a breach of the implied warranty of habitability (IWH) because an IWH is only implied in residential leases. LL's Breach of CQE Peter could argue that LL breached the CQE and has now made Peter constructively evict from the premises. For Peter to claim constructive eviction (CE), LLs conduct must have interfered with the enjoyment of the premises, LLs conduct must have been substantial and the tenant must have had abandoned the premises. Thus, as of right now, Peter cannot claim constructive eviction because he is technically still on the premises. However, even if it were to it seems unlikely that Peter could prevail with this argument. While Peter could argue that LL's conduct of not speeding up the construction process interfered with their business, which is their primary use of the premises), LL could easily argue that her conduct was not substantial enough. A landlord has a duty to prevent substantial interference from happening. LL could argue that by informing Peter about the repairs initially and deducting $100 from his monthly rent, she met her duty because she went out of her way to at least try to make sure that the construction was not effecting her building. Further, if Peter complained that the inability to access the rear door for pizza deliveries affected their business, LL could counter argue. Similar to the Echo consulting case, where a provision in their lease also stated that the tenant had a ""common right of access"", Peter never had an exclusive right of access to the rear door of the parking lot. In the Echo consulting case, the tenant did not satisfy constructive eviction because the construction activities in that case were merely ""intermittent"" and ""temporary"". Here, LL could also argue that although the construction was going on for longer than expected, nonetheless, it was bound to be temporary and not last for the rest of Peter's lease. Most jurisdictions do not hold annoyances like the noises construction to be a substantial enough interference with the use of the premises. One potential argument for Peter that may have more weight however is the dust getting into the windows of the pizza shop because of the construction. Peter could argue that since people are evidently eating the pizzas typically right after buying them, the risk of having that dust inhaled by a customer violates several health violations. However, for Peter's argument to ""intermittent"" and ""temporary"". Here, LL could also argue that although the construction was going on for longer than expected, nonetheless, it was bound to be temporary and not last for the rest of Peter's lease. Most jurisdictions do not hold annoyances like the noises construction to be a substantial enough interference with the use of the premises. One potential argument for Peter that may have more weight however is the dust getting into the windows of the pizza shop because of the construction. Peter could argue that since people are evidently eating the pizzas typically right after buying them, the risk of having that dust inhaled by a customer violates several health violations. However, for Peter's argument to prevail he would probably have to give more information - the amount of dust, if its temporary or not, if its actually near the pizza or not. LL may counter argue this and say that as a tenant in the food industry, he has the duty to also ensure he is meeting health code. This may mean relocating the making and storing of pizza to another part of the pizza shop where dust is not present. While the modern legal system is protective of tenants, landlords should also be protected by their reasonable efforts to prevent substantial interference from happening. However because of modern society and tenants expectations, Peter could potentially argue that to this point, LL should have gathered more information from the construction company about how long they were going to take to finish repairs. Nonetheless, LL could still argue that since the Old Caveat Lessee does not make sense anymore, and landlords should make repairs because they are in a better financial position, wouldn't a tenant prefer a landlord to hire a company to make a thorough repair job and take more time than hire a mediocre company to do the job? Evidently, the tenants expectations are in conflict here but given modern society, it seem that LL is not breaching her duty to prevent a substantial interference from happening. Nonetheless, given such modern principle, the breach of CQE may be broadened and Peter could potentially file for compensatory damages and/or punitive damages. Similar to the Echo consulting case where the construction noises interferred with the business of the tenant, Peter could argue that inability to access the rear door, having to navigate through the maze of scaffolding and other annoyances interfere with the pizza shops business. Since such annoyances are effecting the usual sales of the pizza shop, Peter like the Echo consulting tenant, could file for damages, at the very least. While, it seems that LL may be putting her best efforts in, punitive damages may be appropriate to deter a negligent tenant who is not considerate of possible financial and health risks construction can impose on the pizza shop. One other possible argument Peter could make is to claim a breach of CQE resulting in partial eviction, spot. Since Peter's lease included the designated given the minor encroachment on his deignated parking parking spot he has the right to enjoy whats included in his lease in its entirety - not just a part of it. Similar to the Smith v. McEnany case where the landlord was bound in breach of CQE because he build LL may be putting her best efforts in, punitive damages may be appropriate to deter a negligent tenant who is not considerate of possible financial and health risks construction can impose on the pizza shop. One other possible argument Peter could make is to claim a breach of CQE resulting in partial eviction, given the minor encroachment on his deignated parking spot. Since Peter's lease included the designated parking spot he has the right to enjoy whats included in his lease in its entirety - not just a part of it. Similar to the Smith v. McEnany case where the landlord was bound in breach of CQE because he build a wall that encroached on the tenant's property by 9 inches, Peter could argue that the construction equipment goes over his parking space and is being partially evicted from his premises. If this prevails, the majority rule is for total abatement. This means that Peter could withhold rent in its entirety because he has entered the lease for all of which is included in the provisions, not just a part. LL could possibly counter argue and say that while it was a minor encroachment, he is still able to park. LL could also argue that since the construction equipment is of the company's and not hers, she is not required to evict another wrongdoer. That is under the minority (American) rule, Peter would be required to remove the trespasser, that is the construction equipment, or file a claim for eviction. Under the majority (English) rule however, Peter could argue that a landlord is better to evict because she is familiar with the building, who has access to what, and is in communication with the construction company. Peter could argue that under modern policy rationales to prevent disputes between a tenant and a wrongdoer that could result to violence, she is required to ""evict"" the construction equipment from the spot. In addition, Peter could potentially argue that he has a right to exclude the construction equipment from his designated parking spot. Like the Jacque v. Steenberg case where the homeowners were allowed to refuse a mobile home company from going through their land to deliver a mobile home, Peter could argue that he is entitled to refuse the construction company from using his parking spot as a rest area. This however may be a better argument for LL to make to the construction company since she owns the commercial building. LL could argue that the legal system protects the exclusive enjoyment of property owners and as a result, should have excluded the construction company from the spot. Like both the policy rationales in the Jacques case and the Berg v. Wiley case, property owners should be able to rely on the judicial process to evict or exlude someone from their property in order to avoid violence or negative tensions. As a result, LL could have went through the judicial process to remove the construction equipment, even if this may have been a stretch. Since she never did, Peter can claim this another breach by LL. Given above, it seems that Peters best argument to leave the premises and not pay rent, is to claim for partial eviction. Nonetheless, the landlord has a duty to mitigate damages if a tenant abandons the premises and stops paying rent. As a result, whether or not Peter would claim for any sort of breach, LL would have to at able to rely on the judicial process to evict or exlude someone from their property in order to avoid violence or negative tensions. As a result, LL could have went through the judicial process to remove the construction equipment, even if this may have been a stretch. Since she never did, Peter can claim this another breach by LL. Given above, it seems that Peters best argument to leave the premises and not pay rent, is to claim for partial eviction. Nonetheless, the landlord has a duty to mitigate damages if a tenant abandons the premises and stops paying rent. As a result, whether or not Peter would claim for any sort of breach, LL would have to at least try to re-let the premises. Unlike the Sommer v. Kridel case, where the tenant attempted to surrended the premises before even starting the lease because the tenant's marriage broke and could not afford it, Peter would be leaving half way during his lease and merely just because of the annoyances. This could be an argument for LL to poke a hole into, in that Peter could still financially afford it and is not financially at a disadvantage. Nonetheless, under common law rules, LL would still be liable to try to find another tenant to take over the 5 year lease.

68202246-13a0-4c1f-a238-2590685176fa," The main issue is whether the language in the conveyance creates a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD) accompanied by a Possibility of Reverter (POR), or a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS) accompanied by a Right of Entry/Power of Termination (ROE/POT), or a Fee Simple Absolute (FSA) which carries no future interest, thus allowing Eve to sell the property. A FSD is created by using durational language to attach a condition to the possession of the property, such as ""so long as X does not occur."" Similarly, a FSSCS is created using conditional language that also attaches a condition to the possession of the property, such as ""provided that."" A FSA is possession of the property outright with all property rights and no restrictions or conditions. The conveyance by Dana to Eve was ambiguous, meaning we look to the rules of construction to determine the interests while also looking for language to signal the intent of the grantor. The conveyance creates either an FSD, FSCSS, or FSA depending on these rules, with a reversion being held by the grantor, which became Fiona when Dana passed away. There is very little accompanying language to determine the intent of Dana, so we use the rules of construction. The rules of construction favor a FSSCS over a FSD. Unlike Mahrenholz, where the court held that the ambiguous language, accompanied by the language of the future interest, created an FSD, here the language is slightly less ambiguous, since there are only two competing phrases with no reference as to the future interest attached. However there is a small notion of intent in the way Dana wants to ""keep Blackacre in her family."" This would support an argument from Fiona that there was a condition attached with an expected reversion in the future, and as such she has the right to enter the property and terminate the interest of Eve, who may have violated the condition when she attempted to sell the house. In response, Eve would point to another rule of construction which favors the free alienability of property, and that rule has been infringed upon here. Eve would argue that courts have previously been reluctant to enforce restraints that prevent the sale of the property, and as such she must own the property in FSA and therefore has the right to sell the property if she chooses to do so. In determining exactly what kind of interest was conveyed, courts would need to balance the interests of fairness against the interests of both the parties. Fiona has an interest in seeing a FSSCS or FSD because that would give her the power to reclaim the land she was so sentimental about, Eve has an interest in an FSA which would allow her to sell the land. If the court finds an FSD or FSSCS, then Fiona's rights must be considered when rule has been infringed upon here. Eve would argue that courts have previously been reluctant to enforce restraints that prevent the sale of the property, and as such she must own the property in FSA and therefore has the right to sell the property if she chooses to do so. In determining exactly what kind of interest was conveyed, courts would need to balance the interests of fairness against the interests of both the parties. Fiona has an interest in seeing a FSSCS or FSD because that would give her the power to reclaim the land she was so sentimental about, Eve has an interest in an FSA which would allow her to sell the land. If the court finds an FSD or FSSCS, then Fiona's rights must be considered when looking to sell the property. An FSA finding would destroy any future interest held by Fiona and could lead to her childhood home being sold by a third party. The court will likely find for a FSA, voiding the alienability restraint, and allow Eve to solicit offers from potential buyers. The next issue is whether Eve has a strong argument for the sale of the property. Eve would argue that it would be economically wasteful to NOT sell the property, as it is in a state of disrepair - which would require significant investment - and the market value of the property has exceeded expectations. However as seen in the Ark Land case, economic factors are not the only factor that should be considered, and as such it would need to be determined whether Fiona's sentimental and emotional ties to the land should be considered, despite Fiona technically having no future interest if the court rules Eve owns the property in FSA. Eve would argue that Fiona has made no contribution to the property in many years and by her own admittance had ""no interest in returning to New Suffolk"", whilst Eve tended to the property for the time that she lived there and continued to pay the taxes on the real property, and it would be unjust to take the property away from her after she invested so heavily in Blackacre. Eve would also argue, as a matter of policy, that Fiona had not lived on the land for 16 years during which time Eve had lived there for a significant amount of time, and as such it would be unfair for Fiona to appear suddenly and make demands about the property she had previously shown no interest in. The next issue is whether Fiona has a basis for reclaiming the property. Fiona would likely argue that during Eve's possession of the property, she engaged in permissive waste that could negatively impact the value of the property, despite the actual value having increased. Permissive waste occurs when the possessor of the property neglects and ignores the condition of the property and allows it to become damaged, worn, or unsafe as is the case here with the missing shingles and cracked glass. Eve, as tenant, as a duty to avoid engaging in waste wherever possible according to traditional common law. However, she may be able to make the creative argument that the waste occurred out of necessity because it was impossible for her to maintain the emotional strength required to live in the house of her late cousin. Fiona would again argue that the conveyance should be considered a FSD or FSSCS in order to allow her to reclaim the property and prevent further waste, and deny the fact that Eve's grief is a sufficient justification. As seen in the unused farm case, it is important to consider not only the damaged, worn, or unsafe as is the case here with the missing shingles and cracked glass. Eve, as tenant, as a duty to avoid engaging in waste wherever possible according to traditional common law. However, she may be able to make the creative argument that the waste occurred out of necessity because it was impossible for her to maintain the emotional strength required to live in the house of her late cousin. Fiona would again argue that the conveyance should be considered a FSD or FSSCS in order to allow her to reclaim the property and prevent further waste, and deny the fact that Eve's grief is a sufficient justification. As seen in the unused farm case, it is important to consider not only the interests of the present interest holder but also the future interest holders as well, since they will be heavily impacted by any major changes made to, or sale of, the property. Eve selling the property would be a huge financial, sentimental, and emotional loss for Fiona. If the court did find a FSD or FSSCS, Fiona would be able to make a strong argument that Eve has neglected the property and allowed it to fall in a state of disrepair, and since the is currently in possession of the property, it would be just to require her to pay for the repairs to the problems she allowed to occur. Another small issue is whether Eve even violated the condition at all. The language of the conveyance reads ""my house is not to be sold."" This language suggests that any FSSCS or FSD is only violated when she actually sells the property, not merely solicits offers from potential buyers. If that were the case, then Eve would still retain rights to the property since she has not violated the condition, yet. Fiona would argue that merely engaging in negotiations with potential buyers is an attempt at selling the property and therefore violates the condition. If Eve did violate the condition, then the property became Fiona's when she returned to New Suffolk and terminated Eve's interest by her intent to move in and reclaim the property. At which point Eve would cease to have an interest in the property and Fiona would own it outright in FSA. Whether Eve can sell the property or not ultimately hinges on the courts decision to award Eve the property in FSA, or find a FSD or FSSCS that would give Fiona future interest rights. It would seem to be unfair that Eve can sell Fiona's childhood home and Fiona receive nothing for it. However it would also be unfair that, while Eve spent a lot of time at the property, Fiona was away for a significant time and had only wanted to be involved when it was a possibilty that it would be sold. Ultimately, the outcome of the situation relies on whether the courts find for a defeasible interest, or for a fee simple absolute. The former would allow Fiona to at least retain some interest in the property and have her rights considered in all events regarding the property in the future, and at most would allow her to retake the property as the grantor of the estate. The latter would completely destroy any interest Fiona had and give Eve the supreme right to do whatever she likes with the property, including selling the house. "," The main issue is whether the covenant of quiet enjoyment has been breached by Linda. This doctrine implies that the premises will be fit for use at the time of first use, and the landlord will keep those premises in that shape for the duration of the lease. The covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) can be breached by an actual or partial eviction, constructive eviction, or conduct not rising to the level of eviction but requiring compensatory damages to avoid injustice. Actual or partial eviction occurs when the landlord evicts the tenant from the property, or encroaches on the property outlined in the deed. Constructive eviction occurs when there is an interference in the use of the tenants property, the interference is significant, the tenant notifies the landlord and gives reasonable time to fix the issues, finally the tenant must vacate the premises in a reasonable time if the issues are not fixed. Peter has a tenancy for years, and would argue that Linda has breached the CQE by the continuously delayed construction that is negatively impacting, and therefore constructively evicting, his business. He would argue that the scaffolding, noise, and dust is an interference with his business. He would argue that the interference is substantial not only for the inconveniences that occur by not being able to use the back door properly and the other issues mentioned above, but also the length of time of the interference is beginning to decrease his revenue and therefore his ability to keep the business open. He would also argue partial eviction because of the equipment encroaching on his designated parking spot outlined in the lease. Peter would argue constructive eviction in that the scaffolding and construction has become a permanent interference so substantial that he can no longer use the property as he has in the past. Linda would respond by saying that she is not at fault for the delays caused by the contractor, and that it is the contractor who is at fault, if anyone, however Peter could argue that since she hired the contractor she is also liable for the contractors actions. Linda would deny that the interference is permanent since the construction will no doubt eventually be complete and any interference removed. Peter would argue that and thus violates his common right of access his access to the building is impeded by the scaffolding thereto the commercial space and also the common lot. Linda would counter, citing Echo v. N Conway, where a business that having to use a different door than usual did not breach the CQE since their would respond by saying that she is not at fault for the delays caused by the contractor, and that it is the contractor who is at fault, if anyone, however Peter could argue that since she hired the contractor she is also liable for the contractors actions. Linda would deny that the interference is permanent since the construction will no doubt eventually be complete and any interference removed. Peter would argue that his access to the building is impeded by the scaffolding and thus violates his common right of access thereto the commercial space and also the common lot. Linda would counter, citing Echo v. N Conway, where a business that having to use a different door than usual did not breach the CQE since their access was merely changed, not removed. She would argue that Peter still has access to the space through the front door of the space and the separate entrance for his shop, as well as the fact that his customers and employees have access to the common lot still, and that his lease does not mention any common right of access to the back door of the building. Peter would claim that the interference has not been fixed within a reasonable time of his notifying of the landlord, and therefore should be considered a breach. Linda would again counter that the length of the delays are through no fault of her own and that Peter would be better off pursuing a cause of action against the contractor for damages resulting from the delays, since they are a third party wrongdoer and Linda has made best efforts to rectify the problem. In order to complete a claim of constructive eviction, the tenant must vacate the premises in a reasonable amount of time, which Peter has not yet done. Further, she would argue that an inconvenience and loss had by Peter was compensated for by decreasing his monthly rent in consideration for the interference, and as such Peter has no claim. Peter would likely argue that $100, or 5%, of rent is nominal compared to the losses sustained by late deliveries and fewer customers. Since Peter has not left, and has a fairly weak claim against his landlord, it would be in his best interest to remain on the property and seeking higher compensatory damages in exchange for the interference caused. Or perhaps he should also pursue an action against the contractor for being the proximate cause of his misery. Peter may also be able to argue partial eviction for the encroachment on his parking space. Partial eviction occurs when the land outlined in the deed is encroached upon by the landlord or another party. Peter would cite the wagon case from decades ago that found in favor of the tenant withholding rent because the landlord built a wall that encroached on the tenant's property. Traditional common law would favor Peter withholding rent, he is entitled to full use of the space in exchange for the full amount of rent, and allow him to withhold all rent because he does not have full access to the space. Linda would counter by showing that the modern approach is to find an equitable solution. In finding a solution she may agree to compensate Peter for the encorachment by further decreasing his monthly rent in consideration of the inconvenience. With the lease having just begun again, it would be in the interest of both parties to find an equitable solution as opposed to the alternative of both parties needing because the landlord built a wall that encroached on the tenant's property. Traditional common law would favor Peter withholding rent, he is entitled to full use of the space in exchange for the full amount rent, and allow him to withhold all rent because he does not have full access to the space. Linda would counter by showing that the modern approach is to find an equitable solution. In finding a solution she may agree to compensate Peter for the encorachment by further decreasing his monthly rent in consideration of the inconvenience. With the lease having just begun again, it would be in the interest of both parties to find an equitable solution as opposed to the alternative of both parties needing find new tenants or premises. If Peter does leave the premises, citing constructive eviction, and the court finds that the Linda did not breach the CQE, Peter is liable for the rent remaining on the lease. However he would cite Sommer v. Kridel, where a landlord whose tenant terminated the lease early on had a duty to mitigate damages caused by the tenant's missed rent by making a good faith effort to lease the property to a new tenant if one was so available. Peter would argue that even if he was liable for the rent, Linda has a duty to try and find a new tenant to mitigate the damage caused by Peter's termination of the lease. Linda must show effort in trying to find a new tenant, either by showing the property or creating ads in newspapers and online. Peter would be able to dispute her good faith effort if no evidence supports that she made one. Linda is not required to find a new tenant, merely make a good faith effort at attempting to find a new one. The best course of action for Peter would be to remain on the premises and avoid placing himself in a position where he is paying rent for a space he is not using. Instead of seeking termination of the lease under a CQE breach through constructive eviction, he should gather evidence of his projected revenue and profit margins and seek compensatory damages against Linda and maybe the contractor for the difference between the projections and the actual revenue and profit amounts. Society would prefer that commercial real estate is used to its fullest extent, and is not wasted through vacancies caused by problems between landlord and tenant that could have had an equitable solution that did not require vacating the premises and incurring significant costs for both landlord and tenant.

a9738fe5-2df1-4661-b147-de435b7eeeb6," The conveyance uses contradictory language. Eve is granted Blackacre, the ""provided that"" language is conditional and indicates Eve owns Blackare in fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS), however the ""so long as"" clause is durational that empasies indicates a fee simple determinable(FSD). The rules of construction of ambiguous convayances prefer a FSSCS over a FSD. The second sentence of the conveyance adds that the house is not to be sold, emphasising that this is in fact a condition of the conveyance and where the rules of conveyance require reading as a whole, further supports a FSSCS. Though the rules of construction also encourage the free alienability, it is clear the grantor's interst was to keep the house in the family and the house not be sold. Thus, Eve owns Blackare in fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Dana has the power of termination/ right of reentry. Fiona has nothing. When Dana unfortunately passes, she inherets Dana's power of termination/right of entry to Blackacre as she inhereted all of Dana's personal property which includes the future interest in Blackacre, and Dana still owns the property in fee simple subject to condition subsequent. After Dana's death, Eve leaves Blackacre and provides no maintenance of the property. She turns the tax payments on auto-pay and leaves for Florida. As the present interst holder, she has the right to the property. When Fiona and Eve return, under the conveyance Fiona holds the power of termination/right of entry but cannot yet exercise it becuase Eve has not violated the condition subsequent which prevents Dana from selling the house. However, where Fiona is the potential future interest holder, she may make an argument that Eve is creating permissive waste. Eve is creating permissive waste becuase she is neglecting the property in Florida, evidenced by the tattered roof, glass cracked and other problems. A present interst holder has the obligation to prevent waste. Under the rules of waste in the Barn case, where the future interst holder wanted to stop the present interst holder from raising a barn, Fiona may make a claim as a future interst holder. Fiona has a stronger arguement that the Barn case becuase permissive waste is destructive to her future intersts, the raising of the barn was ammeliorative and raised the value of the property so the future interst holder was granted some damages for the current value of the old barn, but were not estopped from raising a new one. Fiona will argue that by not putting Blackacre to its any use, it is creating waste and becuase she has a future interst in the land, claim damages to repair the property. However, she would only be able to move onto Blackacre with Barn case, where the future interst holder wanted to stop the present interst holder from raising a barn, Fiona may make a claim as a future interst holder. Fiona has a stronger arguement that the Barn case becuase permissive waste is destructive to her future intersts, the raising of the barn was ammeliorative and raised the value of the property so the future interst holder was granted some damages for the current value of the old barn, but were not estopped from raising a new one. Fiona will argue that by not putting Blackacre to its any use, it is creating waste and becuase she has a future interst in the land, claim damages to repair the property. However, she would only be able to move onto Blackacre with the premission of Eve who has the right still at this point,. At the same time, Eve has recieved a phonecall to sell Blackacre. Where Eve is restricted from selling the house under the conveyance, she has an arugement that it is in the best interst to sell the property, including the house. Where at common law, the courts have looked into the economic interst of the present and future interst holders, it is clear that the price of sale is the best interst of to both Eve and Fiona: Eve is not using the home and for Fiona to use of the home requires an investment money. Where there is a clear benefit, Fiona has an argument to sell the property. However, in the Delapetated House case, the life tenant who had no future interst made the arguement that the land must be sold for her economic intersts so she should support herself and pay the taxes, however it was evidenced that she was able to care for the home and afford the taxes, similarly indicated by Eve turning on the autopayment of taxes and not visiting the lot for five years, showing she is not inconvienced nor does she require Blackacre for her home. Thus the court will not ignore a potential future interst holder as they did in the House case, because the unfair benefit to one party. Fiona would argue that if Eve was allowed to sell the home, it would unfairly benefit Eve economically and harm Fiona both economically and emotionally, the land may increase in value and she has a significant emotional attachment. Additionally, the Arkland case, though considering whether the petition in kind or in sale rather than uphold a future interst holders interst, the courts looked beyond economic intersts of the parties, and considered the emotional attachment to the house and whether it has been in the family for generations. Where the Arkland lot had been in the family for years and the family used it on weekends as a retreat, here Blackacre has been in the family for at least 29 years, likely more as it is unclear when Dana's parents bought the home, and Fiona has made it clear she feels sentimental toward Blackacre. The best and most equitable solution is to allow the property to be sold, but keeping the house and reasonable plot of land and some of the profit from the sale to pay for the taxes for Fiona, which also if reading the conveyance with specificity, does not violate the condition. "," Peter has a term of years lease with Linda that runs until December 31, 2023. Unfortunately, the construction on the building has resulted in a significant imposition on Peter's business and he would like to break his lease. Thankfully for Peter,the covenant of quiet enjoyment provides Peter with options. Becuase this is a commercial lease Peter is excluded from claiming the broader remedies which would have been provided to him under the implied warranty of habitability becuase IWH is only available to residential tenants. Nonetheless, Peter has options. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in all leases, commerical and residential. The premise is to ensure a tenant is able to use their premies within the reasonable expectations of the lease. The construction on the building, which the landlord owns in entirety, has breached Peter's covenant of quiet enjoyment in multiple ways. Linda has breach Peters's CQE in an actual partial eviction. The scafolding has infringed on Peter's designated parking spot that is specifically desingated to him in the lease. The encroachement into Peter's parking space is like the Brick Wall case, where the wall was on the property by only a few inches, however becuase a lease entitels you to all of the land described in it, the tenant in that case was considered to have been acutally evicted. Additionally, though the parking lot in the Brick Wall case remained usable for other purposes, it was no longer useable for the rented purpose, as it does here where Peter can no longer easily park his car in his designated spot which ensures that he has a place to park and does not take a parking spot from the invaluable customers who are convienced by the provided parking lot availiablity. If Peter chooses to leave, he will have a good claim for a constructive eviction under the covenant of quiet enjoyment. In order ot have a successful constructive eviction claim, the issue must be caused by a landlord breach, the tenant must notify the landlord of the issues, the tenant must allow the landlord reasonable time to remedy the issues, and then the tenant must leave within a reasonable amount of time. If Peter does chose to leave now, he will have met all the necessary steps in a claim for constructice eviction. The construction is causing many problems for Peter: it is blocking one of the very important entrances for customer ease and for deliveries which is likely causing a downturn in revenue because If Peter chooses to leave, he will have a good claim for a constructive eviction under the covenant of quiet enjoyment. In order ot have a successful constructive eviction claim, the issue must be caused by a landlord breach, the tenant must notify the landlord of the issues, the tenant must allow the landlord reasonable time to remedy the issues, and then the tenant must leave within a reasonable amount of time. If Peter does chose to leave now, he will have met all the necessary steps in a claim for constructice eviction. The construction is causing many problems for Peter: it is blocking one of the very important entrances for customer ease and for deliveries which is likely causing a downturn in revenue because customers who would park in the lot are inconvienced as are the delviery expectations are compromised. In the Bank case, loss of an entrenace or the convience that is not the only entrance is not considered a constructive eviction becuase no single entry was promised. However, here, Peter can make an arguement that the entrance is more significant to his business and why he rented the space in the first place - it encourages customers to come becuase they are convienced, and when customers are not coming to him it allows him to easily function a business. In the Bank case, the entrance did not have an effect on the business itself, only the convience of the tenant, however the purpose of the rental here is for the business ease and this is a higher level of infringment. Futher, Peter is unable to open the windows in the pizza shop becuase it is loud and dusty, and Peter even closed the shop for a week closed the shop for a week to avoid the construction but what was supposed to last a week has gone on for months. The landlord continuously promises that the construction will end, in the Flooding case, water flooded the rented space everytime it rained and caused issues in the office was not permenant becuase it would eventually dry up; similarly here where the scafolind is not permenant, but the Flooding case held that perminancy of the condition does not require it to be everlasting, but significant and sure to the effect on the tenant. Peter has continuously notified the landlord of the issues, calling every week that the consturction goes beyond his expectation, which is clear notice. As weeks turn into months of construction, Peter has given the landlord a reaonabkle amount of time and now must leave within a reasonable time. However, reasonableness is assessed with sympathy to the tenant to understand that often a tenant has less abilities to leave the property. In the Bank Case the crowning blow is the five inches of flooding when there is intended to be a large meeting with attendees from far away; Peter's crowning blow may be the continued drop in revenue and the court will be sympathetic even though he has indurred other months of declining revenue. If Peter truly does not want to leave Main Street, he may bring a claim for damages under the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Similar to the Bank Case, where one of the entrances were closed off, though no specific entrance is promised in the lease as one specific entrance is promised, the construction here does not close off the entrance but has a similar effect. However, the court found that becuase the lease did not explicitly promise the use of a specific entrance, it did not amount to consturctive eviction. even though he has indurred other months of declining revenue. If Peter truly does not want to leave Main Street, he may bring a claim for damages under the covenant quiet enjoyment. Similar to the Bank Case, where one of the entrances were closed off, though no specific entrance is promised in the lease as one specific entrance is promised, the construction here does not close off the entrance but has a similar effect. However, the court found that becuase the lease did not explicitly promise the use of a specific entrance, it did not amount to consturctive eviction. However, the Bank was able to collect damages where the construction and noise was disruptive to the tenants, and the tenant had not left the premises indicating that the disruptions were not so significant to rise to cosntrucgive eviction. Should Peter chose to stay, he would be able to make a claim for damages. Linda may make an arguemnt that the condition is not so signifcant and that this is a reaonble expectation of the tenant, that the buidling have construction on it. The lease does not provide any specific right to use the parking lot for customers, only the right to his parking spot, and if Peter does leave on the claim of the issue regarding the lot and the back entrance, that he is responsible for the rent until Linda can fill the space which will be difficult while the budling is under construction because it did not actually rise to constructive eviction. IN this case, Linda does have the responsibility to mitigate the damages and relet the apartment should Peter wish to leave, and can do so by putting up for rent signs, placing adds, or contacting a leasing agent. Until Linda is successful in releasing, Peter may be liable for the rent if he abandonds the property. Additonally, Linda has given Peter a partial abatement for rent of $100. Linda may argue that where Peter has accepted the abatement and the contions have not worsend, that a partial abatement is appropriate and was accepted and he has not been evicted other than the $100 worth, potentialy representing the actul eviction of his parking spot. Finally, Linda may argue that is not a breach becuase she is preventing waste on the apartment becuase without the construction Peter may have to be actually evicted if the building were to have structural issues. This is not supported by the facts, but we do not know why the construction is in place. In sum, Peter has options: his best option being a claim for damages at the moment becuase there is no promise of use of a specific door, and he has not left, and this may allow him to include the damages of the drop in his revenue. If he choses to leave, he may raise the defense of constructive eviction should Linda come after him for the remaining rent, however Peter will have to wait for Linda to file suit and moving is expensive for a business and he may want to ensure recovery. promise of use of a specific door, and he has not left, and this may allow him to include the damages of the drop in his revenue. If he choses to leave, he may raise the defense of constructive eviction should and Linda come after him for the remaining rent, however Peter will have to wait for Linda to file suit moving is expensive for a business and he may want to ensure recovery.

d3d89043-c41a-4cf9-aba0-17b47f4750c9," Issue 1: Conveyance The conveyance from Dana to Eve would appear to have the intent of creating a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS). However, following the rules of construction which heavily favor the fee simple absolute (FSA) and the free alienation of property it is more likely that the courts will see the conveyance as a FSA. Rule 1: The rules of construction are set up to help courts interpret documents where they pertain to an unclear conveyance of real property. The notable rules in this instance are that documents should be interpreted to favor conveyance in FSA and to interpret documents to favor the free alienation of property. In addition, the doctrine of waste comes into play in this instance as Blackacre has been subjected to five years of passive waste (it was left to rot without proper upkeep by the owner, Eve). Application (Eve): This situation is similar to the White v. Brown case where a woman had left specific instructions in her will that her house was not to be sold as a ""condition"" of her conveyance of the property to her relative. The court held that despite the intent of the grantor to keep the property in the family, both the doctrine of waste and the rules of construction favored the free alienation of property and the ownership of the house in FSA. Distinct from that case, however, is the fact that Dana conveyed Blackacre to eve whilst she was still alive. This inter vivos transfer of property should clearly establish that Eve owns Blackacre in FSA. Based on this analysis Eve would be able to entertain offers to sell Blackacre, and indeed to sell Blackacre without violating the will. The FSA, as the champion of all estates, gives Eve the right to use, or not use, the property as she sees fit, and to convey such property according to her wishes. In additon, there is nothing in the facts to state that Eve ever attempted to sell Blackacre, only that she recieved an offer and is curious if she could get other bids which further weakens any arguments that she could have breached any terms that a court might interpret into the conveyance. Application (Fiona): Distinct from the White v. Brown case is the fact that the house in that case was inhabited, the land or not use, the property as she sees fit, and to convey such property according to her wishes. In additon, there is nothing in the facts to state that Eve ever attempted to sell Blackacre, only that she recieved an offer and is curious if she could get other bids which further weakens any arguments that she could have breached any terms that a court might interpret into the conveyance. Application (Fiona): Distinct from the White v. Brown case is the fact that the house in that case was inhabited, the land was being used by the individual, and the passive waste was due to inability rather than active neglect. Eve has been neglecting Blackacre for five years, and although the value of the land has increased, the value of the house itself has not. Presuming that the court holds that the language in the conveyance does form a FSSCS, then the issue of Dana, Fiona, would retain a right of entry/ power of termination provided that Eve ever attempts to sell the house. Conclusion 1: In light of both the rules of construction, the doctrine of waste, and the language of the conveyance itself, the court will hold that Eve has ownership of Blackacre in FSA, and so may alienate the property at will. Fiona has no future or present interest in the property. Furthermore, should the court hold that Eve merely holds Blackacre in FSSCS, her recieving an offer and contemplating if she could get other bids would not constitute ""attempting"" to sell the property as stated in the conveyance, and so Eve still would not have breached any terms that could trigger a right of entry on the part of Fiona. Issue 2: Repairs of Blackacre Given that Blackacre has fallen into severe disrepair it seems just that either repairs be made, or the land be sold. The main question is as to whether or not Eve has a responsibility to pay for repairs to Blackacre. Rule 2: The doctrine of waste is most applicable when determining responsibility for repair costs. Courts loathe to let useful property sit and rot due to the neglect of the owner as much as it is frowned upon to actively destroy or devalue the property. In cases of waste the courts will consider the potential value of the property, the current use of the property, and whether the alleged waste has hurt the value of said property. Application (Eve): The doctrine of waste is most applicable when determining responsibility for repair costs. Courts loathe to let useful property sit and rot due to the neglect of the owner as much as it is frowned upon to actively destroy or devalue the property. In cases of waste the courts will consider the potential value of the property, the current use of the property, and whether the alleged waste has hurt the value of said property. Application (Eve): It can't be contested that Eve has let Blackacre fall into disrepair. However, working under the assumption that Eve owns the property in FSA for reasons discussed above, it is Eve's right to use or neglect the property, and to part with it as she sees fit. Eve could very well sell the land for the house to be demolished, or demolish the house herself and build a new one should she so choose. A court in this instance would look favorably upon Eve alienating the property in order to rectify the waste situation, but it is unlikely to order her to pay to repair the house first. Application (Fiona): Working under the assumption that Eve owns the property in FSA for the reasons stated above, Fiona has no claim to compel Eve to repair the house short of purchasing the property back from Eve with a condition of the sale being that Eve repairs the house first. However, if the courts had held that Eve only has a FSSCS and that Fiona has a right of entry on to the property it is possible that the courts would compel Eve to make restitution for the passive waste that resulted from her neglect of the property. Conclusion 2: The courts would likely hold that due to Eve holding the property in FSA and her desire to alienate the property, she is not responsible to Fiona or anyone for the repairs needed on the house. It is possible that those costs could be included in any sale negotiations, but that is not a situation outlined in the facts, nor would a court speculate on that. Issue 3: Sale of Blackacre The instrument of conveyance of Blackacre specifically stated that the house was not to be sold. Given that language, the issue becomes how, if at all, can Eve solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre aside from the one unsolicited offer that she recieved? Rule 3: This problem returns to the rules of construction as discussed above, particularly the free alienation of The instrument of conveyance of Blackacre specifically stated that the house was not to be sold. Given that language, the issue becomes how, if at all, can Eve solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre aside from the one unsolicited offer that she recieved? Rule 3: This problem returns to the rules of construction as discussed above, particularly the free alienation of property. Courts will interpret instruments of conveyance to favor the free alienation of property wherever possible. In addition, courts will interpret instruments to favor the FSA, which inherently grants the holder of the property in FSA the right to alienate the property as they see fit. However, courts are also meant to interpret instruments so as to best align with the will of the grantor, and instruments are to be read as a whole so as to not invalidate other sections of the instrument. Application (Eve): Although the instrument of conveyance specifically requested that the house not be sold, by following the rules of construction it becomes clear that that language is unenforceable as Eve was granted the property in FSA, which necessarily includes the free alienation of property. It wouldn't do to interpret the instrument to allow Fiona, who has not been on the property in sixteen years to retain a right of entry and prevent Eve from alienating the property when Fiona has had no connection to the land in nearly two decades. That removal, and her lack of efforts to check on, visit, or otherwise interact with the land that she would now try to lay claim to further undermines Fiona's claims that Eve shouldn't be allowed to sell the property. Application (Fiona): The instrument of conveyance was very particular in its language, and in the intent of the grantor, Dana. Dana intended for the property to be used by someone she saw as family, Eve, and then when Eve was done with the property it was to remain in the family. Her language clearly states that Eve has the property ""so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house"". Following the rules of construction, the courts should look to the intent of Dana, and they should also hold that reading the first part of the conveyance as a transfer of property in FSA would invalidate the later request that her house not be sold. In addition, in Dana's will, it is stated that Fiona inherits all of Dana's personal property. This establishes that Dana and Fiona had a good relationship, and it provides further evidence that Dana intended for Blackacre to remain with the family (Fiona) once Eve had finished her use for it. Conclusion 3: the courts should look to the intent of Dana, and they should also hold that reading the first part of the conveyance as a transfer of property in FSA would invalidate the later request that her house not be sold. In addition, in Dana's will, it is stated that Fiona inherits all of Dana's personal property. This establishes that Dana and Fiona had a good relationship, and it provides further evidence that Dana intended for Blackacre to remain with the family (Fiona) once Eve had finished her use for it. Conclusion 3: Although the intent of the grantor is important, the courts will rule in favor of creating FSA wherever possible, as well as trying to favor the free alienation of property. Although Dana and Fiona might have had a good relationship as evidenced by Fiona's inheritance in the will, it is not sufficient evidence that Dana had intended for Blackacre to return to Dana when Eve was not using it. The instrument of conveyance predates the will, and very specifically names Eve, and no others, as owning Blackacre, and therefore Eve owns Blackacre in FSA and can seek out offers to buy the land from her as she pleases. "," Issue 1: Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (CQE) and Constructive Eviction The construction on the building where Peter keeps his pizza shop has caused a significant disruption to his business and profits. The issue arises from his term of years lease, and whether the continued construction is a breach by the landlord, Linda, of Peter's CQE. Rule 1: The CQE can be seen to be breached by a constructive eviction, that is to say that the landlord's actions have inhibited the tenant from using part or all of the space that they are renting. When a constructive eviction or other breach of the CQE occurrs the tenant may withhold rent or terminate the lease with proper notice. The facts at hand relate to the bank door case, in which a bank was arguing that building construction which blocked off one of several entrances to their branch, as well as dust from the construction entering their branch constituted a constructive eviction, and so they were entitled to not pay rent. The court in that case held that the minor inconvenience of the dust, as well as the fact that there are multiple doors to the branch negated the claim of a breach of the CQE by constructive eviction. Application (Peter): Peter has been term of years tenant under Linda for a number of years. He has recently renewed his lease until 2023, but is rapidly losing revenue from his business due to the construction project on the to not pay rent. The court in that case held that the minor inconvenience of the dust, as well as the fact that there are multiple doors to the branch negated the claim of a breach of the CQE by constructive eviction. Application (Peter): Peter has been term of years tenant under Linda for a number of years. He has recently renewed his lease until 2023, but is rapidly losing revenue from his business due to the construction project on the building blocking easy access to the door nearest the parking lot. That being said, there are still two more entrances, one to the rest of the units in the building, and one to the main street. Peter would argue that because the door nearest the parking lot is where a majority of the customers enter from, as well as where a majority of his deliveries depart from, it is a major source of revenue and so the lack of access to that door is significantly harming his business. In addition, there is also minor encroachment on Peter's designated parking spot. Under the doctrine of constructive eviction a tenant may withold rent equivalent to the portion of the land that they are constructively evicted from. Similarly to that case, the area being taken is negligible and the area is still functional, but it is still prohibiting Peter from using a portion of the land that he is renting. Furthermore, Peter has voiced his concerns to Linda on numerous occasions over the months that the construction project has taken, and he has given her more than enough time to rectify the issue. Therefore a court should hold that Peter is justified in being released from the remainder of his lease without further need to pay rent as he has been construcitvely evicted from a portion of the land, as well as the significant economic impacts of the project has breached his CQE. Application (Linda): In the Spring of 2019, Linda contracted with a company to complete repairs on the exterior of the building. She was informed that the repairs would only take ""a week or so"" and passed that information along to all her tenants, including Peter. The repairs run significantly longer than a week, and runs over into several months with no sign of ending in sight. Every week Peter calls her and informs her of the problems that the construction is creating for his business and she explains that repairs are going longer than expected, but that she is working on it. A typical constructive eviction case relies on the landlord excluding a tenant from some portion of the land that they rent, this is no such case. The only land that Peter is excluded from is a small section of his designated parking spot, which is still functional as a parking spot throughout the duration. In the context of the bank door case, even having the back door entirely closed off did not constitute constructive eviction, so there is no conceivable way that merely adding some scaffolding in front of the door could count as constructive eviction. In addition, when a tenant has been constructively evicted they are only permitted to withhold rent that is proportional to the than expected, but that she is working on it.

In addition, when a tenant has been constructively evicted they are only permitted to withhold rent that is proportional to the area that they are being constructively evicted from. In this instance Linda has already reduced Peter's mothly rent by $100 to compensate him for the area he is constructively evicted from in his parking space. Peter also has other recourse for his delivery drivers which doesn't involve them navigating the scaffolding in order to get to their vehicles. Peter's shop still has an unobstructed door that leads directly to the main street of New Suffolk. He could easily mitigate the economic damages by having his drivers park on the street, or drive up to the front and have pizzas loaded into their cars directly whilst construction lasts. Furthermore, any constructive eviction requires that the tenant give the landlord notice and adequate time to address the issue. It is not Linda's fault that the contractors have run well over schedule, she may be taking every step to ensure that the project is completed as quickly as possible, however, she may be barred either financially or contractually from hiring other contractors to finish the job. The fact pattern is unclear as to precisely what the situation between Linda and the contractors is, or why the construction has gone on for such a long time. It may be the case that the contractors are in fact justified in taking such a long time, and that the time that has elapsed is perfectly reasonable for repairs of the required nature to be completed. Regardless, without further facts it is impossible to conclude that Linda has not compensated Peter for the minute section of land he is constructively evicted from, Peter has done nothing to mitigate his own damages, and there are no facts stating that the time that the contractors are taking is unreasonable. Based on those assumptions and interpretation of fact, Linda can not have breached her CQE with Peter, and so Peter would still be responsible for the rent for the entirety of his term of years lease. Conclusion 1: Based on the information provided, along with reasonable assumptions regarding the nature of the repairs, the court will hold that Linda has not breached her CQE with Peter, and although he is constructively evicted from a small portion of his parking spot, Linda has adequately compensated him for it. Based on those findings, if Peter were to abandon his term of years lease he would still be responsible for the entirety of the rent he would owe until the expiration of the lease in 2023.

Seeing as Peter has called me for advice, I would advise him to stay on given the circumstances and to explore with Linda alternative options for his rent, to possibly include further reductions until construction is completed.

529faf72-9186-4652-8fcc-58ba8b46a5cb," Question 1: Conveyance: The first issue is in regards to Dana's conveyance of Blackacre. The conveyance uses both conditional and durational language, which imply two different types of conveyances. The term ""provided"" suggests that the grantor, which was Dana, and is now Fiona after her death, is conditionally granting Blackacre to Eve via a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS), and if the condition of her trying to sell the house is broken, then Dana holds a right of entry in Fee Simple Absolute (FSA) in which she could come back to the property and reassert her claim over it successfully. However, it also uses the term so long as, which is durational, implying a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD). This would give Fiona a possibility of reverter (POR), which would give her the property back automatically upon Eve trying to sell it. Following the rules of construction, this conveyance would be seen as a FSSCS, because the rules call to favor a FSSCS over a FSD if there is ambiguity in a conveyance. However, if we were to follow the result of the Marenholtz case, we would see this as a FSD. This ruling was in opposition to the rules of construction, though, and is unlikely to be found here, especially because that case revolved around the lack of transferability of future interests, but in New Suffolk, future interests are transferable. However, you could say that this was in accordance with the rules of construction, as they call to look for the intent of the grantor. Dana clearly wanted the property to stay in the family, which is why she gave it to Eve after Fiona said she did not want to return to New Suffolk. In an FSD, the property would automatically revert back to Dana, or Fiona after Dana dies, once Eve attempts to sell the house. This would effectively keep Blackacre in the family. This conveyance is also similar to White v. Brown, because the grantor specifically stated that they did not want the home to be sold. Following the dissent in this case, we know that the conveyance could not be an FSA, because there is a specific call to restrain alienability of the property, and there can be no restrictions on FSA's. If we were to follow the majority opinion of White, we would look to the rules of construction, which promote the alienability of property. Therefore, we would rule the conveyance as a FSA, and ignore the restraint on alienability. Further, nothing in the conveyance specifies a reversionary interest in the grantor. Because Dana did not state that she holds a right to re enter or a possibility of reverter, and because the rules of construction favor a FSA, Eve may hold the property in FSA. However, due to the Conditional language, and the rules of construction, it is likely could not be an FSA, because there is a specific call to restrain alienability of the property, and there can be no restrictions on FSA's. If we were to follow the majority opinion of White, we would look to the rules of construction, which promote the alienability of property. Therefore, we would rule the conveyance as a FSA, and ignore the restraint on alienability. Further, nothing in the conveyance specifies a reversionary interest in the grantor. Because Dana did not state that she holds a right to re enter or a possibility of reverter, and because the rules of construction favor a FSA, Eve may hold the property in FSA. However, due to the Conditional language, and the rules of construction, it is likely that the property will be seen to have been granted to Eve in FSSCS, with Fiona holding a Right of Entry. Eve: Eve's best arguments for her ability to sell the property are related to the conveyance. If the case followed the holding in White v. Brown, she should be entitled to sell the property because she would hold the property in FSA, and there would be no restraints on it. If the ruling was a FSSCS, then Eve would rightfully still be on the property, because Fiona, who inherited Dana's interests, has not reasserted her claim over Blackacre, and thus has not yet regained possession of it. Therefore, Eve would be entitled to sell it until Fiona reasserted her claim. Lastly, Eve could claim that if the home is not sold, it would be a case of economic waste. The property is worth a ""staggering amount"", and Eve could make an argument that its best economic value would be if it was sold to a real estate developer. This is similar to the Baker v Weedon case, in which a property was being used as a farm, but would be valued more if sold to the state so they could build a highway through it. Because the property is in better hands economically with a developer than with Eve, who presumably does not have a great knowledge of real estate or property development, the house could be sold if the future interest holders, in this case Fiona, agreed to do so. Fiona: Fiona's best claim to recover Blackacre is if the conveyance followed the Marenholtz case, and was interpreted as a FSD for Eve. In this scenario, Fiona, as the holder of what would have previously been Dana's POR, would automatically regain the property once Eve began inquiring about selling the property. If the court determined that Eve's curiosity about bids constituted an attempted sale, Fiona would be the owner of Blackacre in FSA. Fiona has a claim against Eve for repairs on the basis of permissive waste. Permissive waste is present when a property owner neglects the property, and in turn it becomes run down and loses value. Eve left the property in 2014, and does not return until 2019. When Fiona first sees the house in 2019, it has all sorts of issues, including cracked glass and missing roof shingles. This is clear evidence of permissive waste, as these issues would not be present if the owner of the property was properly taking care of the land. Instead, Eve's negligence of the property has caused it to fall into bad shape. Fiona can further prevent Eve from selling the property by attacking Eve's economic waste claim. In Baker, the court said that future interest holders' interests must be taken permissive waste. Permissive waste is present when a property owner neglects the property, and in turn it becomes run down and loses value. Eve left the property in 2014, and does not return until 2019. When Fiona first sees the house in 2019, it has all sorts of issues, including cracked glass and missing roof shingles. This is clear evidence of permissive waste, as these issues would not be present if the owner of the property was properly taking care of the land. Instead, Eve's negligence of the property has caused it to fall into bad shape. Fiona can further prevent Eve from selling the property by attacking Eve's economic waste claim. In Baker, the court said that future interest holders' interests must be taken into account when a property is being sold. Further, in the Ark Land coal mining case, the court determined that economic factors are not the only interests to look at when determining a partition, but emotional and sentimental ties as well. While this sale would not be a partition, if a court followed this line of thought about placing value in sentiment and emotional investment, they would likely look at the future interest of Fiona and prevent the sale. Fiona grew up on Blackacre, and has an intention to move back, if Eve pays to fix it. This could lead to the court preventing a sale of the property. Even just looking at the Baker case alone, a court could prevent Eve from selling the property, as her future interest must be taken into account. Further, if Fiona moves back, and Eve still has possession of the property, Fiona could recover from Eve based on the Implied Warranty of Habitability. If Fiona were to rent the house from Eve, Eve would be a landlord, and would have a duty to make the house livable. The state of disrepair she left it in is her fault, and not the tenants (Fiona), which would make her liable to pay to fix the property to make it livable. "," Peter's claims against Linda would be in regards to a breach of his Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (CQE), which comes with his term of years lease. The covenant can be breached in 3 ways: actual/partial eviction, constructive eviction, or damages. Peter's first claim can be for partial actual eviction. Like in Smith v. Mcenany, where a landlord built a wall that encroached a few inches onto a tenants property, the space allocated to Peter in the lease is being encroached. This is evident through his parking space, as the construction company's equipment goes into it. The parking space is property that Peter was given in his lease, and he has a right for it to not be interfered with by his landlord. Following the Smith decision, Peter could withhold all of his rent, and would likely be successful. The theory behind this is that although it is only a minor encroachment onto his property, an encroachment into any portion of a tenants allocated space is an eviction from it in its entirety. Because the tenant is paying for the full space, any encroachment of it by someone with paramount title is a breach of the contract alltogether. He can further aruge that the scaffolding is interfereing with his common right to access, as the back door, which is a common right of entry, is almost unusable. By withholding rent, that Peter was given in his lease, and he has a right for it to not be interfered with by his landlord. Following the Smith decision, Peter could withhold all of his rent, and would likely be successful.

He can further aruge that the scaffolding is interfereing with his common right to access, as the back door, which is a common right of entry, is almost unusable. By withholding rent, Peter can claim partial actual eviction. However, Linda can argue against this, with a more modern apporach to partial actual eviction, in which rent is reduced proportionally to the space that is being encroached upon. Linda has offered to take 100$ off of Peter's rent each month because of this issue, which may effectively combat the actual eviction issue. Further, Linda can use the judgement from the Echo Consulting case, which said that a common right to access includes a door, but if the lease does not specify a specific door, which Linda and Peter's lease does not, there is no eviction if that specific door is blocked while there is still a common right to access elsewhere. Peter may be able to claim constructive eviction. For constructive eviction, a tenant must be substantially interfered with, give the landlord reasonable notice and time to fix the issue, and then must vacate. Peter may be able to argue that the interference from the construction is substantial enough for constructive eviction. Like the flooding in the Reste Realty case, Peter could argue that the construction is severely hindering his ability to do business. He is losing money and customers due to a variety of issues caused by the construction. The scaffolding has created a maze that is very difficult for customers and employees to go through to get in and out of the store. In addition, the scaffolding has partially blocked the back door, which has severely effected pizza delivery times. Lastly, the dust and noise from the construction are annoyances to customers, and there is a lack of parking, as the construction is taking up the common lot, where staff and customers commonly park. Further, the interference for constructive eviction must be created by the landlord, and not the tenant. Peter was unaware of the issue when he signed the lease, as construction began after he signed it. Linda hired the construction companies, thus making the interference her doing. Peter can argue that this is substantially interfereing with his right to quietly enjoy the property to a point where it creates a constructive eviction. He has satisfied the notice element as well. Linda informed Peter it would only take a week or so, but the construction has been going on for months. Peter has been calling Linda weekly to complain about the issues, to which she just explains why the construction is taking longer than expected. This notice is far longer than that given in Reste Realty, where constructive eviction was found. Therefore, it is likely that Peter's notice will be reasonable enough time for constructive eviction. From this, I would advise Peter to leave and withhold rent, as if Linda sues him for the remaining rent, he can use constructive interfereing with his right to quietly enjoy the property to a point where it creates a constructive eviction. He has satisfied the notice element as well. Linda informed Peter it would only take a week or so, but the construction has been going on for months. Peter has been calling Linda weekly to complain about the issues, to which she just explains why the construction is taking longer than expected. This notice is far longer than that given in Reste Realty, where constructive eviction was found. Therefore, it is likely that Peter's notice will be reasonable enough time for constructive eviction. From this, I would advise Peter to leave and withhold rent, as if Linda sues him for the remaining rent, he can use constructive eviction as a successful defense. The construction has created substantial interference that has negatively effected his business, and he has given the landlord reasonable notice to fix the issue, to which she has not acted. He can thus complete constructive eviction by leaving the property and withholding rent. Linda does have counterarguments against constructive eviction, though. If Peter does not evict, he has no claim to constructive eviction. This is because it would negate the substantial element. If an interference was not substantial enough to make a tenant vacate the premises, then it is not substantial enough for constructive eviction. Further, she could argue that there was no ""crowning blow"", like in Reste. In Reste, the tenants vacated after there was a flooding during a meeting they held in an office, determining that that was the ""last straw"", and they could no longer operate at the location. Peter has not had a crowning blow. While there is interference, it seems to be constant, and there is not one overt act that has risen the interference to a point in which he felt that he must vacate. Lastly, Peter could get damages from Linda for her breach of the CQE. Like in Echo, where the court ruled construction was enough to breach the CQE, but not enough to amount to constructive eviction, Peter could make a claim that the construction could amount to damages. The issue with the common right of access is similar in both Peter's case and the Echo case. In each, there was a door that was more convenient that the businesses commonly used. However, it did not expressly state in the lease in either case that the door was included in the lease. Therefore, there is no actual eviction. Further, there is no constructive eviction because, although the easier door to use is being interfered with, there is still a right to access, as Peter has use of other doors in the building to enter. Further, in Echo, the noise from the construction was argued to be constructive eviction. However, the court determined that it was not substantial enough for constructive eviction, but still warranted a breach of the CQE, resulting in damages. Because the construction has been taking much longer than expected, and it has negatively impacted his business, Peter will, at the very least, likely be able to get damages from Linda. ",1403,1340
8a2c52d8-2f79-4f23-bbca-9dacca67bf27," Dana Prior to the conveyance, Dana held Blackacre in fee simple absolute. After conveying Blackacre to her cousin, Eve, in fee simple determinable, Dana had a possiblity of reverter in Blackacre. Upon her death, this future interest transferred to her heir, Fiona. The fee simple determinable was created by the durational language of the conveyance, and its accompanying possibility of reverter will automatically spring to return the property to the grantor (or heir) if the condition is met. Fiona Fiona presently has a possibility of reverter in Blackacre that would divest Eve in the event Eve attempts to sell the house, as Fiona inheirited Dana's possibility of reverter upon Dana's death. As Eve has allowed to suffer permissive waste from exposure to the elements, Fiona can file a claim for either damages or an injunction from the court to protect her future interest in the property. Given that Eve has not attempted the sell the house, Fiona does not have a present possessory interest in the property, but the possibility of reverter will automatically spring if Eve follows through with her intention to solicit bids for the property. Fiona's claim for damages is strong, as the harm to the property cam directly from Eve's negligence in maintaining it for a five year period. Additionally, it is likely that Fiona could request that the court partition the property by sale and purchase it ouright for herself, as Eve has demonstrated that she does not wish to reside in the home. Eve Eve presently, following Dana's conveyance, possesses Blackacre in fee simple determinable, subject to divestment if she ever attempts to sell the home. Eve could argue that she is soliciting bids on Blackacre not for the purposes of selling the property, but to assess its current value when paying damages to Fiona for the permissive waste Eve allowed the property to suffer. Eve Eve presently, following Dana's conveyance, possesses Blackacre in fee simple determinable, subject to divestment if she ever attempts to sell the home. Eve could argue that she is soliciting bids on Blackacre not for the purposes of selling the property, but to assess its current value when paying damages to Fiona for the permissive waste Eve allowed the property to suffer. "," Peter, the pizza shop owner, has become unhappy with the conditions of the commerical space he has leased due to ongoing construction at the property, and is now considering moving to a new location. Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment The ongoing repairs to the commercial building in which Peter leases space have cause the pizza shop to lose business and have limited Peter's ability to enjoy the property without interferance. The covenant of quiet enjoyment, which is implied in leases to which it is not explicitly addressed, requires that tenants be able to enjoy their leased property without interferance from the landlord. Similar to the Echo v. North Conway Bank case, Peter's pizza shop is suffering from construction occuring to the structure they lease space inside, limiting full use of the property and the ability to host customers. The noise, dust, scaffolding, and equipment around the building are preventing Peter from using the property as he normally would, and has, in the past. If a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in found to have occured, the tenant can recieve damages or have the lease terminated without need to pay. The significant interference that Peter is experiencing in using his space as intended due to the construction supports that a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoment has occurred. Constructive Eviction Peter's pizza shop has suffered ongoing harm from the construction taking place outside. Constructive evictions occurs when the circumstances of a situation become so egregious that it as if the tenant has been evicted from their property. Constructive eviction requires that the tenant abandon the property reasonably soon after the harm occurs, but after the landlord is given notice and reasonable time to correct the issue. The Reste Realty (rain in the basement) case provided an example of how an ongoing issue, caused or simply permitted to occur unabatted 5 the landlord, that precludes the tentant to using by the property for its intended purpose will meet the constructive eviction standard. The basement level commercial space rented by the tenant in the Reste case would repeatedly, and foreseeably, become evictions occurs when the circumstances of a situation become so egregious that it as if the tenant has been evicted from their property. Constructive eviction requires that the tenant abandon the property reasonably soon after the harm occurs, but after the landlord is given notice and reasonable time to correct the issue. The Reste Realty (rain in the basement) case provided an example of how an ongoing issue, caused or simply permitted to occur unabatted by the landlord, that precludes the tentant to using the property for its intended purpose will meet the constructive eviction standard. The basement level commercial space rented by the tenant in the Reste case would repeatedly, and foreseeably, become flooded following every major rainstorm and render the space unusable for the the tentants purposes. Peter could argue that the construction is impeding his ability to run a restaurant, as the noise, dust, and scaffolding deter customers from entering, as well as preventing his delivery drivers from preforming quickly. As he still has access to the space, and as it is all still usuable, this has more connection to the Echo v. North Conway Bank case than it does with Reste Realty, and it is unlikely that a claim for constructive eviction would be successful. Additionally, Peter would be required to abandon the premises within a reasonable time of the harm occuring, for which it would seem he is several months overdue. If he abandons the property, and if he fails on a claim for constructive eviction, he could be liable for rent to Linda until the space is relet to another tenant, or Linda could hold the space open and sue for the rent owed as it comes due. If he were to win, however, he could terminate the lease without owing Linda rent for the unoccupied period of the lease. As Peter's shop remains in the leased space, this is at its best a weak claim. Additionally, the temporary nature of the construction, which the landlord seems to be addressing in good faith, does not support that this is a constructive eviction. Partial Actual Eviction Construction equipment encroaches upon Peter's designated parking space. The rule of the McEnany (wall) case provides that if the landlord disposesses the tenant of some of the space accounted for in their lease, it is a partial actual eviction that can result in the tenant no longer owing rent for the remainder of the lease. While the minor portion of the parking space occupied by the construction equipment is certainly unusable by the tenant, the parking space itself remains viable for its intended purpose and in use. Additionally, the presence of the equipment, despite the prolonged nature of the repairs, is temporary and the space will presumably be returned to the tenant upon the completion of repairs. This is a very weak claim. Damages If Peter is able to successfully argue one of the above concerns, he would be able to file suit for equipment is certainly unusable by the tenant, the parking space itself remains viable for its intended purpose and in use. Additionally, the presence of the equipment, despite the prolonged nature of the repairs, is temporary and the space will presumably be returned to the tenant upon the completion of repairs. This is a very weak claim. Damages If Peter is able to successfully argue one of the above concerns, he would be able to file suit for damages against Linda. As Linda is already discounting his rent for the inconvenience, this amount would be taken in to consideration for any award given to Peter. Assignment and Sublease If permitted by the terms of the lease, Peter could either assign or sublease his interest in the property to a third party to allievate the cost of rent without breaking the lease. If Peter were to assign the lease to someone else, he would have no future interest in the property and the new tenant would pay rent directly to the landlord. If he were to sublease the space to a new tenant, it could be for part or all of the remaining time on his lease, but the new tenant would pay Peter rent, and Peter would then pay rent to Linda. Implied Warranty of Habitability The implied warranty of habitability does not apply in Peter's circumstances. ",373,1073
95ddc6af-6cfc-4932-a968-f35ef34edc6d," Interests Created by Dana's Conveyance In analyzing Eve and Fiona's interest in Blackacre, one must first look at the conveyance written by Dana. Before Dana's passing, she was sitting on Blackacre in Fee Simple Absolute (FSA). This means that she held the only interest in Blackacre, and she was free to do whatever she wanted with Blackacre. This right was given to her upon owning Blackacre in FSA. Because Dana is free to do as she pleases with Blackacre, she decided to write a conveyance which would give Blackacre to her cousin, Eve, once Dana passed away. Though Dana was proper in writing a conveyance, it was not written very clearly. When a court looks at an amibguous conveyance, they will look towards the rules of contruction to determine which sort of conveyance the grantor intended to create. Looking at the intent of the grantor is extremely important when determining the type of conveyance created. This is the first rule of construction. This is demonstrated in the case we discussed, where in a deed, the grantor included the language ""not to be sold."" After grappling with this language, the courts determined that the grantor intended to create a life estate by using that specific language, as a life estate connot be sold. Although this language is present in Dana's case, her intent nor the actual language of her conveyance demonstrate a wanting to create a life estate. She does not convey Blackacre to Eve ""for life,"" but rather based on a condition. Most of the time, conveying a life estate will have to be done using the language ""for life."" Dana's conveyance does includes the language, ""provided that and only so long as."" This creates an issue because that phrase contains both durational language as well as conditional language. When looking at the ""provided that"" verbage, this would traditionally create a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. A fee simple subject to condition subsequent means that the grantee may walk onto the property, however if the condition subsequent is violted, the grantor has the power of termination or right of entry. This means that once the condition subsequent is violated, the grantor has the opportunity to go and take back the property, though they do not have to. Dana's conveyance also contains the language, ""so 8 as."" As opposed to the previously discussed long fee simple subject to condition subsequent, this durational language creates a Fee Simple determinable. A fee simple determinable is much like a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in that a subsequent. A fee simple subject to condition subsequent means that the grantee may walk onto the property, however if the condition subsequent is violted, the grantor has the power of termination or right of entry. This means that once the condition subsequent is violated, the grantor has the opportunity to go and take back the property, though they do not have to. Dana's conveyance also contains the language, ""so long as."" As opposed to the previously discussed fee simple subject to condition subsequent, this durational language creates a Fee Simple determinable. A fee simple determinable is much like a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in that a conveyance will allow the grantee to walk onto Blackacre. However, the interest in the original grantor will change. In a fee simple determinable, the grantor has the possibility of reverter. This means that as soon as the condition subsequent is violated, the property automatically reverts to the original owner. This is unlike a fee simple subject to condition subsequent where the original grantor MAY take back the property if they choose to do so. Furthermore, Dana's conveyance does not name a thrid party Blackacre will go to when the condition is violated. This eliminates the possibility that she intended to create a fee simple subject to executory limitation. This leaves the court to decide whether Dana created a Fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. The rules of construction favor a fee simple subject to condition subsequent as opposed to a fee simple determinable. Therefore, because language that indicates both conveyances is present in Dana's will, it is likely that a court would conclude that she intended to create a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Therefore, categorizing Dana's conveyance as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent gives the following interests to the parties: Dana: Right of Entry/Power of Termination Eve: Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent Eves Arguments for Soliciting Offers: The right to sell property is included in the bundle of rights we are bestowed upon when we own property (in FSA). However, Eve does not own Blackacre in Fee Simple Absolute. Eve holds Blackacre in Fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS). The condition is that Eve does not attempt to sell the house. Once this condition is violated, because Eve owns Blackacre in FSSCS, Dana would have the right to retake the property. However, Dana has passed away, and all of her personal property goes to her daughter, Fiona. Along with this, Dana's 8 right of entry also would go to Fiona. This means that Fiona would have to actually reclaim the property. property (in FSA). However, Eve does not own Blackacre in Fee Simple Absolute. Eve holds Blackacre in Fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS). The condition is that Eve does not attempt to sell the house. Once this condition is violated, because Eve owns Blackacre in FSSCS, Dana would have the right to retake the property. However, Dana has passed away, and all of her personal property goes to her daughter, Fiona. Along with this, Dana's right of entry also would go to Fiona. This means that Fiona would have to actually reclaim the property. In order for Eve to make the best argument to sell the property, she would have to convince Fiona not to exercise that right of entry. As long as Fiona does not exercise her right of entry, even though Eve has attempted to sell the property, she would still hold the present interest in the property. Furthermore, the facts presented state that all of Dana's personal property go to Fiona. It does not mention that her future interest in Blackacre is transferred as well. Eve also did not attempt to sell the property, but she recieved an offer, therefore, as of now she did not violate the condition subsequent. Furthermore, Eve can argue that because of the rising value in the property, it would be economic waste to allow the property to sit in the state that it is in. This means that the property is worth a substantial some of money and it is not benfitting any of the parties involved. Furthermore, the house is depreciating and it is not being used for its purpose anymore. Also, Eve can argue that Fiona does not have a strong connection to the land anymore (dissent in Ark land case), and therefore would be justified in selling. It would be best for Fiona to argue that she now has the right of entry and is exercising that right to reclaim the property once she noticed that Eve was attempting to sell Blackacre. If Fiona did not want to sell Blackacre, Blackacre would go to her once she exercised that right of entry and Fiona would no longer hold an interest. Fiona's Claims for Reclaiming Ownership/Repairs As discusssed above it is likely that a court would conclude that Eve has a FSSCS. Because of this, Fiona now has a right of entry onto Blackacre. Once Fiona discovers that Eve attempted to sell Blackacre, she has the right to reclaim the property. This is true if Dana's future interest in Blackacre transferred to her daughter upon death. In regards to the repairs of Blackacre, Fiona would not be entitled to payment for the repairs unless she had already exercised her right of entry because until then, she only has a future interest in Blackacre. Once that right of entry is exercised, she can claim that Eve slept on her interests in Blackacre and that because of that, waste resulted. The court allows for a8 landowner to collect on different forms of waste. Here, Eve's actions of not maintaining the property resulted in a depreciation of the state of the property. This is classified as permissive waste where the incaction of a tenant results in the transferred to her daughter upon death. In regards to the repairs of Blackacre, Fiona would not be entitled to payment for the repairs unless she had already exercised her right of entry because until then, she only has a future interest in Blackacre.

The court allows for a landowner to collect on different forms of waste. Here, Eve's actions of not maintaining the property resulted in a depreciation of the state of the property. This is classified as permissive waste where the incaction of a tenant results in the depreciation of the property. If a court finds that because Eve was not presnt at Blackacre, and this resulted in the damages to the house, Fiona may be able to recover under permissive waste. "," What Type of Lease Does Peter Have? CQE/IWH First, in adressing Peter's issue, it is important to note that he is invovled in a term of years lease in what is described as a commercial building. Under every lease, commerical or residential, there is an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. This covenant, though not expressly stated, is implied and read into every lease. Over the years, the courts have saught to expand on this covenant to allow for more equitable relations between tenants and landlords. Courts have moved more towards this covenant of quiet enjoyment and away from the notion of caveat emptor. This meant that the tenant was to take the premises as they were. The courts have swayed away from this long stading notion, mainly because, not everyone who is leasing now is able to make repairs or has as much knowledge of the building of the landlord. (differnet from times where tenants could perfom work on their own). The courts have also went further in reading in an implied warranty of habitability with residential lease. This is an even narrower reading of the covenant of quiet enjoyment aimed at making sure that spaces where people are living are up to health standards. This warranty is only implied in residential leases. Remedies Because Peter is leasing in a commercial space, he will be entitled to claim a breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment by his landlord, Linda. The court affords the tenant with three resolutions when claiming a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The first is8that they can claim that they were actually/partially evicted from there premise by some sort of physical obstabcle. Here the breach by the landlord must be physical. Peter could attempt to claim that because he was entitled to a designated Remedies Because Peter is leasing in a commercial space, he will be entitled to claim a breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment by his landlord, Linda. The court affords the tenant with three resolutions when claiming a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The first is that they can claim that they were actually/partially evicted from there premise by some sort of physical obstabcle. Here the breach by the landlord must be physical. Peter could attempt to claim that because he was entitled to a designated parking spot, and the contruction equipment was encoroaching on his spot, this was a partial actual eviction. This is true because for a successful partial actual eviction claim, it does not matter how much of the property you are being evicted from, there can still be a claim. This is much like the brick wall case where the brick wall was encroaching a few feet onto the plaintiffs property, but the court found that was enough. Similarly, Peter can claim that the equipment was encroaching on his parking spot, and in turn he was partially evicted from an aspect of the designated in the lease. To recover, much like the court did in the brick wall case, a court would likely award Peter the difference between his rent with a parking spot and his rent without one. Linda, can argue however, that although the equipment was encroaching on Peter's spot, he was still able to pull into his parking spot, and is therefore, still getting use out of the parking spot, so there would be no partial atctual eviction claim. The second resolution is constructive eviction. Here the tenant must abandon the premises after giving the landlord reasobable notice of damages or needed repairs. These repairs must substantially deprive the tenant of the value of the space enough that it is as though they are being actually evicted. Furthermore, the tenant must allow the landlord a reasoable time to remedy the damages. If this is not done within a reasonable time, the tenant may abandon the premise and be off the hook for rent. This is the majority view, however, the minority view as this holds that the covenant of quiet enjoyment is mutually independednt of the tenants obligation to pay rent. In order for Peter to claim constructive eviction, he would have to leave the premises and begin establishing his pizza shop somehwere else. He does not have to worry about being on the hook for rent, because the majority view finds that once this covenant is violated, there is no longer a duty for the tenant to pay rent. The Echo consulting case tells us that in order to place a successful Constructive Eviction Claim, the interferance by the landlord must be SO substantial that it is as if the tenant is actually being ejected. Peter would argue that first, he was informed the repairs were only being made over the course of a week. He closed his shop, so that the repairs would not interfere with his business substantially. However, after a week, repairs went on and Peter's business suffered. First, ongoing noise is enough to claim contructive eviction if it is continuous and does not stop. Peter has constantly been rent, because the majority view finds that once this covenant is violated, there is no longer a duty for the tenant to pay rent. The Echo consulting case tells us that in order to place a successful Constructive Eviction Claim, the interferance by the landlord must be SO substantial that it is as if the tenant is actually being ejected. Peter would argue that first, he was informed the repairs were only being made over the course of a week. He closed his shop, so that the repairs would not interfere with his business substantially. However, after a week, repairs went on and Peter's business suffered. First, ongoing noise is enough to claim contructive eviction if it is continuous and does not stop. Peter has constantly been asking about the duration of these repairs, and is always given the same answer. Therefore, Peter does not know when this will end, so it is likely that a court would find the noise continuous. Furthermore, the scallfolding that blocks the rear door makes it very hard for customers to venture through the maze of construction. Additionally, this scallfolding makes it hard for Peter to pull a car up to the door in order to make deliveries. Peter must also keep his windows closed because of all the dust that is flying in from the constuction. Cooking in a pizza kitchen is extremely hot, so one can assume this has becme quite burdensome to Peter and very uncomfortable. Looking at the echo consulting case can give us a pretty clear picture of what is enough to rise to the level of constructive eviction. Similarly, in that case, repairs were being done on the outside of the building. The construction noise and equipment blocking the tenants from one of the entrances created a huge burden, however, the premises described in the lease were still usable and business went on. Linda will want to look to this case in order to defend against a claim of constructive eviction. Much like in that case, Peter still has access to the door, it is just burdensome to get to. Furthermore, the noise of construction that went on in that case was not enough for the court to allow for constructive eviction. However, in our case, the Tenant took a substantial hit on his busines. Therefore, a court may conclude that because Peter's business suffered extreme losses, the disturbance was so substantial that it was as if he was evicted. As an attorney, I would advise Peter to give Linda notice that he intends to leave the premises unless something is done about the repairs. He has asked Linda several times about when the repairs would end, and he was not given accurate info. Giving Linda a reasonable notice that he planned to leave would ensure that he is covered and would also allow Linda time to mitigate the damages she has caused. Although Linda deducted from Pete's rent, it is unlikely that this is proportional to the losses he suffered due to the repairs. Giving Linda a reasonable notice to leave would allow him to be off the hook for the rest of the rent period, as well as giving Linda enough time to mitigate would allow for constructive eviction. The damages Peter suffered7were so substanital in that it is as if he was evicted. Therefore, constructive eviction should be allowed. Addtionally, if a court does not find that the interferance from the repairs rose to the level of constructive eviction, Peter can still make a claim for would ensure that he is covered and would also allow Linda time to mitigate the damages she has caused. Although Linda deducted from Pete's rent, it is unlikely that this is proportional to the losses he suffered due to the repairs. Giving Linda a reasonable notice to leave would allow him to be off the hook for the rest of the rent period, as well as giving Linda enough time to mitigate would allow for constructive eviction. The damages Peter suffered were so substanital in that it is as if he was evicted. Therefore, constructive eviction should be allowed. Addtionally, if a court does not find that the interferance from the repairs rose to the level of constructive eviction, Peter can still make a claim for damages. This does not require that he leave, and he may be compensated for his burdens. ",1549,1573
0cfe0259-bcff-490d-afaf-c55c1ea87e0d," The interests in Blackacre when Dana was alive and conveyed the property to Eve were, Dana had a possibility of reversion in FSA because if the home is attempted to be sold while she is still alive, based on the conveyance, Eve would kicked out and Dana would be retuned possession of the home. Eve had a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because the conveyance listed a conditon (that she not attempt to sell the home and the language of this type of conveyance (""provided that""). After Dana died, the interests shifted since in her will, Fiona inherited all of her personal property. Dana now had nothing because she is dead, Eve may still have a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because the condition that she not attempt to sell the home is still in effect. Fiona can now be seen as a (shifting) executory interest in FSA because she had the right to enter onto the property if the condition is broken and can be seen as the new ""o"" because she has now inherited the interest of the land. If the occurence of Eve trying to sell the home, breaking the condition in the conveyance, she would then have nothing and Fiona would own Blackacre in FSA. With Eve's curiosity and interest in getting other bids for Blackacre, she can make the argument that by her being permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of the home, she is avoiding economic waste. Economic waste occurs when the person with possession of the land does not put the home to its full use. It was clear that when Dana was conveyed the home that Fiona was not interested in moving back to New Suffolk into Blackacre and seems to be planning to move back only by assumption that Eve will pay for the damages which may not be the case in which she argue that Fiona's move back New Suffolk is not definite. She can continue her argument by saying that if Fiona's decision is not definite and she decides not to move back into Blackacre if Eve is not responsibe for fixing the damage to the home, then no one will be in the home which will only continue to deterioate with the cold winters until it is totally worthless in value. This would be committing economic waste and therefore to sell the home because of Fiona's indefiniteness, would be the best option for the property and parties. However, if Fiona says that she will defeintely be moving bakc to New Suffolk whether Eve fixes the damages or not then this argument would be completely thrown out. Eve can also argue that not selling the land would be ameraliotive waste which is the increasing value of a property by the additttion of the current interest holder. Although she did not add to the land and it is then no one will be in the home which will only continue to deterioate with the cold winters until it is totally worthless in value. This would be committing economic waste and therefore to sell the home because of Fiona's indefiniteness, would be the best option for the property and parties. However, if Fiona says that she will defeintely be moving bakc to New Suffolk whether Eve fixes the damages or not then this argument would be completely thrown out. Eve can also argue that not selling the land would be ameraliotive waste which is the increasing value of a property by the additttion of the current interest holder. Although she did not add to the land and it is good waste. For the land to just sit there and keep increasing in value would still be waste if it is not being used nor sold but this may be seen as a weak argument. With Fiona's interest in now keeping Blackacre, she can argue that she can reclaim, first, based on the language of the deed, ""attempt to"". Eve receiving a call about an offer will most likely not be seen as her attempting to sell the home however, Eve has now ventured into a curiosity of other offers and wanting to solicit other offers which could be seen by courts as an ""attempt"" to sell the home. If this is true, then the courts can say that the condition provided in the conveyance has been broken and Eve no longer has any interest in the home and therefore, Fiona can do as she pleases with the home. As far as the damages to the home, Fiona can argue that Eve should be responsible for repairs because she committed affirmative and permissive waste. Affirmative waster occurs when a current interest holder voluntarily causes a devalue to the property. It can be argued that Eve voluntarily left the home, knowing the low temperatures of New Suffolk, and although she did make sure the taxes on the home were continuously paid, she did not make sure that the home was physically taken care of and should have known that no maintenacne to a home, especially in freezing temperatures, could cause significant damage. Although this argument may pass in court, it is likely that it will be found under Permissive waste occurs when a current interest holder allows for a property to be devalued based on their own negligence. It can be further argued that because of the arguments above, that Eve was negligent in letting the home fall apart while moving away and should have made sure the property was upkept. If it is found that Eve is not responsible for the damages and Fiona does not want to move back into Blackacre on the occurence that she will have to come out of pocket in order to do so, the courts may see Fiona and Eve as tenants in common adn find that it makes more sense for them to partition the home in sale and split the earnings however because the courts discourage this they may also want to look at Fiona if she has any sentimental interest in keeping the premises for future family members to come and not want to sell her mothers home and look at a partition in kind. The rationals looked at by the courts in favor of Eve would be that the courts do not want to promote economic waste because of a conveyance espcially if both parties will not be living in the home and Blackacre on the occurence that she will have to come out of pocket in order to do so, the courts may see Fiona and Eve as tenants in common adn find that it makes more sense for them to partition the home in sale and split the earnings however because the courts discourage this they may also want to look at Fiona if she has any sentimental interest in keeping the premises for future family members to come and not want to sell her mothers home and look at a partition in kind. The rationals looked at by the courts in favor of Eve would be that the courts do not want to promote economic waste because of a conveyance espcially if both parties will not be living in the home and letting it rot. The rationals looked at by courts in favor of Fiona would be that courts do not want to encourage home owners that they can pick up and leave their home without maitaining it in some way while they are gone. "," The advice that I would give to Peter would be that if he wants to break his 5 year lease or receive compensation for his troubles, he will have claim that the landlord, Linda, either breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment or that she breached the implied warranty of habitibility. The arguement that Linda can first make is that Peter has a term of years lease with her and can not just leave and stop paying rent whenever he feels like it. Then Peter can counter argue with, If the covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached, it can lead to actual/partial eviction which is if the landlord encroaches onto the property in any way. Peter can argue that because his parking spot which is included in his lease was encroached by the construction company that the landlord hired to do work, then he can argue for partial eviction of the premises. Although it is just by ""a little"" and the fact that he can still use the parking spot may not make a difference and may be seen similar to the tenant in the brick wall case, who was found to be partially evicted from their leased premises when the landlord built a brick wall encroaching onto their premises by just a few feet. Although the tenant could still use the premises and it wasnt encroaching substantially, when a tenant pays for the whole premises they are entilted to the whole premises. Peter can also argue that because that they are no longer able to enter through the rear door without going through a maze and having to go through a construction site which deters his customers and also effects his on time deliveries because the delivery people can no longer use the back door to drive up to and speed up the process. He can argue that all of these inconvenience are similarly messing with actual/partial possession of the leased premises. substantially, when a tenant pays for the whole premises they are entilted to the whole premises. Peter can also argue that because that they are no longer able to enter through the rear door without going through a maze and having to go through a construction site which deters his customers and also effects his on time deliveries because the delivery people can no longer use the back door to drive up to and speed up the process. He can argue that all of these inconvenience are similarly messing with actual/partial possession of the leased premises. An argument that Linda may have for this is the fact that the courts usually look for solutions to this which one would be to lower the tenants rent in which she already offered to do by $100 and therefore, she has made up for the difference in his encroached property. An argument for Linda would that although his company may be being inconvienced by the construction around the back door, this is not the only entrance to his pizza shop while him, his delivery driver and customers still have acces to use the front door anytime they would like. Just as in the bank case (Echo v. North), the courts found that the tenant not being able to use one of the doors as the bank locked it outside of their business hours was not considered to be an eviction at all of their premises as there are other entrances they could use to enter into their rental space. Similarly here, there is another entrance free of construction that gives access to the pizza shop. If the covenant of quiet enjoyment is also breached, this may lead to Peter being able to argue for constructive eviction which entitles the tenant to the promise that their peace and enjoyment of the premises will not be breached. Here, Peter can argue that just as in the Reste Realty case where the tenants were experiencing flooding in their basement unit everytime that it rained and which constantly interrupted their business and purpose of renting the space. Peter can argue that the constant noise and dust is interrupting not only his enjoyment of the premises but also the enjoyment of his customers as he says that sales have been down since the beginning of the construction. In order for Peter to make this argument, he would have to notify the landlord and give her a reasonable amount of time to remedy these issues in which he has done with numerous phone calls to her complainign of these inconveniences in which she gives him an excuse as to why the repairs are taking longer than usual. If it is found that these disturbances are so substantial to his business as they were in the fllooding case, then it would be acknowledged that Peter notified his landlord of these issues in which she failed to remedy in a reasonable amount of time. Linda can argue that similar to the bank case, where the court found that construction to the premises that made noise and created dust was not substantial enough of an interference with the premises and its benefit of it because the tenants were still able to operate their business. Here, Peter is still able to make is found that these disturbances are so substantial to his business as they were in the fllooding case, then it would be acknowledged that Peter notified his landlord of these issues in which she failed to remedy in a reasonable amount of time. Linda can argue that similar to the bank case, where the court found that construction to the premises that made noise and created dust was not substantial enough of an interference with the premises and its benefit of it because the tenants were still able to operate their business. Here, Peter is still able to make pizzas and sell pizzas and the main purpose of his business can still be operated. It was also found in this case that they could not claim constructive eviction because the construction was a temporary interference and not permanent throughout his lease. Here, the construction is alos not permanent and only temporary however, Peter can argue that it has been going on for months when he was orginally told only a week or so. Also, in order for Peter to make this argument, he would have to move out of the premises within a reasonable amount of time. Following this, Linda would have to make a good faith effort to mitigate the expenses she would like to sue him for from the time he moved out until the time his lease would have ended. She would do this by making an effort to find another tenant to come in and pay the rent so she could only sue him for the time that he left the premises until the time she finds a new tenant. She dould do this showing the apartment, putting up ads for the vacancy, and any good faith effort to recruit a new tenant in order to lessen these charges for Peter. In this time, I would advise Peter to put the rent money that he would be not paying to Linda in an escrow as it is always a possibility that he may not win the case and therefore would be responsible for paying Linda for the remainder of the lease. The rational the courts may look at in favor of peter is that they want to promote fairness and do not want tenants to be forced into paying rent for a premises they are not satisfied with. They will also not want to promote landlords being able to do as they please and because Linda told him such a short time of the construction taking place, they may see it as her sticking to what she told him in the first place as ruling for Linda may encourage ladnlords to just tell their tenants any amount of time for a remedy when they know it may take longer and just allow landlords to blame it on other occurences. The rational the courts may look at in favor of Linda is that becuase she has construction going on, to find a breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, it may be really difficult for her to find another tenant at tenant remain and it is not her fault that the moment and it is only fair to her to make the current construction to the premises was needed and is taking longer than expected and longer than she was told. ruling for Linda may encourage ladnlords to just tell their tenants any amount of time for a remedy when they know it may take longer and just allow landlords to blame it on other occurences. The rational the courts may look at in favor of Linda is that becuase she has construction going on, to find a breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, it may be really difficult for her to find another tenant at the moment and it is only fair to her to make the current tenant remain and it is not her fault that construction to the premises was needed and is taking longer than expected and longer than she was told. They may also not want to promote tenants being able to think they can move of their apartment at the slightest inconvenience to them. Although a tenant can also claim a breach of implied warranty of habitability, this argument will be very weak for Peter as it is usually brought into play during residential leases and not commercial leases. However, this warranty requires that a landlord provide a property that is safe, clean and fit for human occupancy. Because Peter does not reside at his pizza shop, he can only argue that the dust that would come in through the windows if he opened them would not follow along with the health and safety codes in place for human occupancy as they could breathe in that dust or it could get on the pizza that he is selling and his customers could fall sick. He can also argue that a construction site is dangeous for his customers coming through the back door can have a peice of material fall on them or trip over something but Linda can again just amke the argument that they can all use the front door clear on a construction site to access the pizza shop safely. This construction does not mess with any of his equipment used to make his pizza nor any essential facilities like the sink or toilet and therefore will likely not follow along with this warranty. If Peter really wants to claim that this warranty was breached, he could stay on the premises and operate his business and withhold rent during the time that the construction continues or he can remain of the premises and pay rent and then sue for damages of rent paid and for the uncomfortableness of the premise which was seen to be done in Hilder v. Peter. Another option for this breach of warranty is to remedy the premises yourself and then withhold rent but it is unlikely that he will hire his own construction crew to finish the work quickly as it is a chance he could lose this argument and be out of more money. In the meantime of all of this, if he decided to stay and go along with the breach of the warranty and does not pay rent that is assigned to his lease, he does not have to worry about LInda coming to lock him out of his pizza shop, evicting him because in order to do this, she would need to go through the judicial system in order to do so and he would be properly notified as the courts do not allow self help remedy the premises yourself and then withhold rent but it is unlikely that he will hire his own construction crew to finish the work quickly as it is a chance he could lose this argument and be out of more money. In the meantime of all of this, if he decided to stay and go along with the breach of the warranty and does not pay rent that is assigned to his lease, he does not have to worry about LInda coming to lock him out of his pizza shop, evicting him because in order to do this, she would need to go through the judicial system in order to do so and he would be properly notified as the courts do not allow self help evictions as they can lead to a non-peaceable eviction and create violence and agression between landlord and tenants. From this information, I would advise Peter to stick it out as I strongly feel he will be seen the same as the tenants in the Echo case and will be better off waiting for the constuction of his five year lease to end.

d14fe6dc-ad38-4146-815b-82d3e66692cf," Question 1 The first issue is what interest's were created by Dana's conveyance. Based on the language, it appears that Dana conveyed Blackacre to Eve and Eve has a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS), therefore making Dana's interest a power of termination/ right of entry. However, the langauge Dana uses is ambiguous and thus the rules of conveyance ought to be applied in order to make these conclusions. The rules include looking at the intent of teh grantor, favoring fee simple abosulte, favoring vested over contingent remainders, free alienability on property, favoring FSSCS over fee simple determinable (FSD), avoiding partial intestacy, and looking at the entire document to garner an understanding. In looking at the langauge of the conveyance some of these rules apply in order to make a conclusion. Dana uses both ""provided that"", which implies FSSCS, and ""so long as"", which implies FSD. In Mahrenholz the court had a similar ambiguous conveyance and concluded an FSD by looking at the intent of the grantor, even though FSSCS is typically preferred to FSD. This is because courts would rather have an indivdual seek out and assert their future interest rather than it automatically reverting back to the grantor. Just as the court ruled and the rules of conveyance explain, grantor's itnent is impotant and Dana did not want the house to be sold. This seems to be more conditional langauge than temporal langauge, which was not the case in Mahrenholz, where it was found to be more temporal language. Using an FSSCS is not only preferred, but it also seems to be more consistent with Dana's intent. Thus, Dana would have power of temination/right of entry. When Dana died however, and she left her property to Fiona, Fiona took over the power of termination interest. The next issue is whether Eve has a stong argument that she sould be permitted to solicit offers for Blackacre. In order to asses this, the rules of conveyance must be used again. Eve could argue that the conveyance did not create a FSSCS, but rather an FSA and the condition should be voided. This is because restraints on alienability are typically not allowed in a FSA, and the only condition that was created was for Eve not to sell the house. Thus without the condition, it woul have read just ""to Eve"", thus Dana would have given away her interest entirely and created an FSA. Favoring an FSA is a rule of conveyance and thus a court may be more willing 2toofview 6 it as an FSA, creating an issue with the restraint on alienability. This is similar to White v. Brown where the ambiguous conveyance created an issue in which the grantor did not want the property sold. They concluded that restraints on alienability conveyance did not create a FSSCS, but rather an FSA and the condition should be voided. This is because restraints on alienability are typically not allowed in a FSA, and the only condition that was created was for Eve not to sell the house. Thus without the condition, it woul have read just ""to Eve"", thus Dana would have given away her interest entirely and created an FSA. Favoring an FSA is a rule of conveyance and thus a court may be more willing to view it as an FSA, creating an issue with the restraint on alienability. This is similar to White v. Brown where the ambiguous conveyance created an issue in which the grantor did not want the property sold. They concluded that restraints on alienability are not favorable and not permitted in an FSA, and the intent was an FSA, to give away her interest. Eve could argue similar facts ot the case, that Dana wanted to give away her interest, and that her intent was more of an FSA and the retraint on alienability should be void, allowing her to seek out solicitations for the property. While Eve may have an argument to support her claim, it is also clear that Dana's intent is for the house not to be sold, and to create a condition, and thus a court may rely on the intent of the grantor and allow the retraint on alienability of the property. Eve could argue, though, that is is economic waste not to sell the property, since the property's value has increased significantly because of the prime location. However, if Dana or Fiona do have a future interest, its also important to protect their interest and selling may not be the way to do so. The last issue is whether Fiona has a basis for reclaiming Blackacre or for holding Eve accountable for the repairs. First Fiona may have a claim to reclaim Blackacre, however, only if the conveyance is read as a FSSCS and not an FSA. If the restraint is read as an enforceable condition, then a FSSCS is created and Dana has a right of entry. When Dana died and she passed her property to Fiona, she could argue that she transferred her interest to Fiona and thus Fiona has the right of entry. This means that when Eve tries to sell the property, Fiona can assert her interest and take the property. However, the weakness, here, is that Eve has not yet attempted to sell the property, since someone else approached her and made the offer and se did not accept. Therefore Fiona will not be able to step in to reclaim the property. if the conveyance is read as an FSA and removes the restraint, Fiona will have no claim and cannot enter it. If Fiona is successful at reclaiming the property it is likely that she will want to hold Eve accountable for the repairs that were created by the neglect of the house for five years. Fiona's strongest argument is permissive waste, in which Eve has duty to mitigate large issues and is responsible for taking care of the property and avoiding large damages. Eve's neglect led to the reparids being needed and thus Fiona can make Eve repsonsible for repairs. However, this is only possible if Fiona has a future interest- the right of entry- and this is only permitted if its an FSSCS and Dana's interest was transferrable to Fiona.

"," Peter has a few claims that he can make in order to attempt to get out of his lease and be able to move without be responsible for the rent. Peter can claim the Linda as breached the covenant of queit enjoyment (CQE), and therefore he can be able to assert either acutal eviction, constructive eviction, or damages. The covenant of CQE explains that tenants have the right to enjoy and use the property without interference from the landlord. His strongest argument is to argue that overall the CQE has been breached due to the construction. He is no longer able to use the space as he needs to for his pizza shop. Due to the dust and scaffolding and lack of access to their back door Peter is having a difficult time with his business, interupting his pizza making and making it difficult to do deliveries. Peter was also told in his lease that he would be given common access door and the door to the back, which is a common access door, is no longer a viable option. As in Reste Realty, the flooding continued to occur and prevented them for carrying out their use of the space as they were entitled to and protected by the CQE. The court rule in Reste Realty that the CQE had been breached and constructive eviction was permitted and they could stop payign rent, since they gave notice, gave reasonable time to fix the issue, and left the premises. Peter can argue that he continued to tell Linda that this was an issue and gave her time to remedy the situation, but since she did not, he could move out, stop paying rent and assert constructive eviction. However, Linda can argue that since it is construction, Peter did not give reasonable time as it is temporay and in time it will be resolved. She can also strongly argue that this is less like the Reste Realty case and more like the Echo case, in which there was also construction and it was temporary. It is not like the flooding, which was so constant that it was deemed permanenet by the court. Also, Echo has lost access to a door, but had access to another door, just as Peter still had access to a common door, which was at the front of the building, and thus did not violate the lease. The court ruled that for these reasons it was not a breach of CQE and constructive eviction did not apply and would still be liable for the rent. However, the court did award damages for the issues construction caused, and therfore, Peter may be able to still get damages to help with his lost profits, which may be one of his strongest ways to case and more like the Echo case, in which there was also construction and it was temporary. It is not like the flooding, which was so constant that it was deemed permanenet by the court. Also, Echo has lost access to a door, but had access to another door, just as Peter still had access to a common door, which was at the front of the building, and thus did not violate the lease. The court ruled that for these reasons it was not a breach of CQE and constructive eviction did not apply and would still be liable for the rent. However, the court did award damages for the issues construction caused, and therfore, Peter may be able to still get damages to help with his lost profits, which may be one of his strongest ways to remedy the situation. Though, Linda could also argue that lowering the rent by 100 is sufficient to warrant damages unneccessary. While, Peter may have some issue with asserting constructive eviction as Linda as some strong arguments to assert, he may also suggest that it is an actual eviction like the brick wall case. Since the lease in that case gave a certain amount of property to be used and the brick wall encroached on that property, and thus they were not using the entire leased property it was an acutal eviction. The contractor's equipment is encroaching on Peter's space that the lease says he is entitled too, and thus, he could say that this is analagous to the brick wall case and amounts to a breach of CQE and he should be allowed to stop rent and termiante the lease. This may be a bit difficult and a bit of an extreme remedy though. Linda could argue that this is a very minor encroachment and that it is better remedied by removing the equipment or renegotiating the amount of rent to adjust for the small encroacment on his space, which a court may find more reasonable than terminating the lease. Lastly, Peter may be able to argue that he should be let out of his lease and let Linda find new tenants since it is her responsibility to mitigate damages. In Sommer v. Kridel, the court ruled that the tenant should not be held accountable for the rent since he had no money and gave notice he would not be able to move in any more and therfore it was the landlord's responsibility to mitigate te damges and re- let the apartment, since they are in the better position to do so. Linda may argue that this is not like this case because the tenant had not moved in yet and had not money, whereas Peter has been there for some time and had already renewed the lease. Peter can also argue that he is losing revenue do to the construction and if his business fails then he will not be able to pay the rent and therefore put the burden on Linda to mitigate the damages she would incur if that happened and find a new tenant. They could also agree on a surrender, in which the lease gets teminated once Linda is able to find a new tenant and thus allowing Peter out of his responsibility to pay the rent. construction and if his business fails then he will not be able to pay the rent and therefore put the burden on Linda to mitigate the damages she would incur if that happened and find a new tenant.

eb5f1d26-20e7-438c-9d76-fbc5d9a54c8b," Essays: Question 1: Fiona's likely position for present and future interests, likelihood for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre and holding Eve accountable for the repairs need on Blackacre Fiona would say that Eve has a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD) because the estate was conveyed to her using durational language such as ""provided that"" and ""so long as."" This means that Eve holds present possessory interest in Blackacre provided that she does not sell the house. Fiona would also say that Fiona herself has a Possibility of Reverter in FSA because she inherited Dana's estate becoming the grantor and the future interest is a reversionary interest in an FSD which is automatically reverts possession to Fiona in the event that Eve sells/attempts to sell the house. Fiona's case is like the dissent in Mahrenholz where the dissent said the conveyance was clear so the rules of construction (ROCs) wasn't necessary. Also, even if the conveyance was viewed ambiguous, the grantor's intent was clear that the house was not to be sold saying ""the house is not to be sold."" Further, the ROCs states that a FSA is preferable when possible which is what would result (through the possibility of reverter in FSA that Fiona has) if Eve were to attempt to sell the house. Since the Rules of Construction are a multi-factor test, different rules can conflict with each other, but need to balance between all to come to conclusion. Both in the Mahrenholz dissent and Fiona's case here, the FSD with an automatic possibility of reverter. While the ROCs do favor a FSSCS over a FSD because it would result in a future interest for Fiona in a right of entry which does not happen automatically, when weighing all the factors, it seems more likely that the lack of ambiguity would mean that the FSD for Eve and possibility of reverter in FSA would hold. Further, future interests need to be taken into consideration when a present possessory interest wants to sell the property. Like in Baker v. Weedon, where the future interest in an estate were contingent remainders with a strong likelihood of possessing the property since the life estate holder was 73, the of the property even though they did not have future interest holders were able to prevent the full2 sale the present possessory interest. While part of the property was leased by the present possessory interest to live off of in Baker, the future interest holders retained a right to of consideration for any in FSA would hold. Further, future interests need to be taken into consideration when a present possessory interest wants to sell the property. Like in Baker v. Weedon, where the future interest in an estate were contingent remainders with a strong likelihood of possessing the property since the life estate holder was 73, the future interest holders were able to prevent the full sale of the property even though they did not have the present possessory interest. While part of the property was leased by the present possessory interest to live off of in Baker, the future interest holders retained a right to of consideration for any conveyance of the property. All parties present and future need to be considered in alienation of a property. Fiona would likely be able to prevent the sale through the language of the conveyance and automatic possibility of reverter if Eve tried to sell the property, and would also be able to have her future interests recognized in court if the property were to be used to be leased. Since courts are courts of equity, her interests, not just economic interests, but sentimental and long lasting connection with the property would also be weighed. This is similar to the conversation that occured about different interest holder's rights in a property (while in tenancy in common in this case, still applies to present and future interest holders) in Ark land, where not just economic interests, but also sentimental and familial interests should be weighed before a sale of property. Lastly, if there were some kind of waste that changes the property from how it was conveyed to Eve, Eve would be potententially liable for damages to Fiona. Fiona not knowing that Eve was thinking about selling the property and thinking about living there if the property was repaied, could use her future interest rights as a way to fix the house which is in ruin with roof shingles missing, glass cracked and other serious problems. Fiona could argue that she has the right, if receiving possession through the possibility of reverter, to receive the property as it was conveyed. She could say that Eve created affirmative and permissive waste by intentionally leaving the house uncared for and allowing it to fall into disrepair. Also, that there was economic waste with the house losing value due to its broken windows, missing shingles and other problems. This shows her delinquent duties as property owner of maintaining the property in the same condition as it was when conveyed and sleeping on her duty to make use of the property. Similar to Wood v Woodrick in some regards, where a barn on the property had gone into disrepair and was knocked down instead of repaired, the future interest holder received damages, not because of economic waste (the property value actually increased), but because the permissive and affirmative waste of injurious ruin of the barn destroyed the personal possessions of a future interest holder. Fiona could get similar damages at the very least for the ruin of her childhood home that Eve allowed permissive and affirmative waste to occur3 under her stewardship. Eve's likely position for present and future interests and arguments that she should be disrepair and was knocked down instead of repaired, the future interest holder received damages, not because of economic waste (the property value actually increased), but because the permissive and affirmative waste of injurious ruin of the barn destroyed the personal possessions of a future interest holder. Fiona could get similar damages at the very least for the ruin of her childhood home that Eve allowed permissive and affirmative waste to occur under her stewardship. Eve's likely position for present and future interests and arguments that she should be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre Eve would likely try point to the Rules of Construction saying that the conveyance was ambiguous and that the restraint on alienation should be struck giving her a FSA. She would have a weak argument to say that because there likely isn't an ambiguity within the conveyance, but the language of ""provided that and ONLY so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house."" The addition of ""only"" inbetween the durational language of ""provided"" and ""so long as"" could be pointed to as an ambiguity. Restraints on alienability are generally not favored in the ROCs, so Eve would argue that the restraints should be struck and the favoring of a FSA over defeasible estates could give her an FSA taking out Fiona's future interest. Like stated above, Fiona would likely argue (like the dissent in Mahrenholz) that there is no ambiguity, but if ruled there is, she would point to the intent of the grantor in not selling the house. Eve receiving an FSA is unlikely, so her next best option, like in the Mahrenholz case where the court ruled that a conveyance was ambiguous and therefore, using the rules of construction, favored a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) over the fee simple determinable because it allowed the grantor to decide whether they wanted to enter the property through a right of entry compared to the possibility of reverter which happens automatically in a FSD. Eve would then need to hope that Fiona did not want to re enter the property since the right of entry does not happen automatically. She then could sell the property if Fiona does not exercise her right of entry upon the selling. Since Fiona is interested in residing the property once again, this is unlikely, but at the very least, if she gets the lease construed as a FSSCS, Eve has the opossibility of Fiona not exercising her right of entry in FSA. Then, if the statute of limatiations passes the ten year mark from when the new owner takes over, Fiona then would not have a right to exercise her paramount of title and right of entry and the sale is final giving the new owner quiet title, Eve the prime sale. Fiona, however would likely exercise her right of entry preventing this. Eve could also use a similar argument that the defense used in Woodrick v Wood for knocking down the barn to maximize the value of the property. Eve could point to increased value of the property in the area and say that it would go against the principal of utility and getting the most out of the property to would not have a right to exercise her paramount of title and right of entry and the sale is final giving the new owner quiet title, Eve the prime sale. Fiona, however would likely exercise her right of entry preventing this. Eve could also use a similar argument that the defense used in Woodrick v Wood for knocking down the barn to maximize the value of the property. Eve could point to increased value of the property in the area and say that it would go against the principal of utility and getting the most out of the property to not sell the property while the value was so high, it could drop at any time and with the disrepair of the house, it would cost even more money to fix and hang onto the property. Fiona would push back saying that the property would be worth even more if the house was repaired instead of sold. Eve would push back on the claims of waste that Fiona could bring. She would likely point to the ameliorative waste (positive changes in the property) which isn't often recognized in common law in the United States, but could say that despite the affirmative and permissive waste that is obvious from the disrepair of the house, the property value has never been higher. In the end, if Eve tries to sell the property, Fiona would likely automatically receive possession of the property due to Eve's condition that she not sell the property and Fiona's reversionary interest in a possibility of reverter. She further would likely be able to receive damages like in Baker v Weedon due to the affirmative and permissive waste of disrepair of the home where a future interest holder received compensation for destruction of property in the barn. "," I would advise Peter that he potentially has several options, some of which are stronger than others. Since he leases from Lisa in a commercial setting, the Implied Warranty of Habitability would not be available to him because that is reserved for only residential leases. His best option would be to argue a Breach of the Covenant for Quiet Enjoyment (CQE). This covenant provides a means for a tennant, commercial or residential, to claim that their beneficial use of the property they have a right to in their lease is being prohibited in some form. There are multiple outcomes that could occur with a claim of CQE, the most extreme and more difficult to argue in the case, is a claim for constructive eviction through the breach of the CQE. A constructive eviction is the inability to use the who property as it was intented, allegedly preventing the use of the property. Like in the Smith case where a landlord purposely took away the use of multiple feet of the backyard of the tenant through a brickwall, Peter could argue that Lisa took away physically part of his parking 5space (went over the white line). Since he could not use the whole property as intended, he would ahve the right to withhold all of his rent according to the traditional common law. Lisa would likely say that he could still use the parking space, so he was not CQE, the most extreme and more difficult to argue in the case, is a claim for constructive eviction through the breach of the CQE. A constructive eviction is the inability to use the who property as it was intented, allegedly preventing the use of the property. Like in the Smith case where a landlord purposely took away the use of multiple feet of the backyard of the tenant through a brickwall, Peter could argue that Lisa took away physically part of his parking space (went over the white line). Since he could not use the whole property as intended, he would ahve the right to withhold all of his rent according to the traditional common law. Lisa would likely say that he could still use the parking space, so he was not restricted to the enjoyment of his property. And at best, he would not have to pay rent for the small portion of the property he was restricted from, not the entire rent. This is the modern law and would be the most likely outcome for this argument. Further, to follow through with a claim of constructive eviction, Peter would need to show like in the Reste Realty case, where a commercial tenant moved out after repeated flooding, that (1) multiple complaints about the issues had been used (he has throughout the months), (2) that the landlord had a reasonable amount of time to fix the issues (she has had several months), (3) a crowning blow (after months of construction, he has been losing money and can't run his business the way he wants to) and(4) that he moves out without paying the remainder of rent (which he deciding if he wants to do). After moving out and surrendering the property, Lisa would likely sue for damages and a breach of contract of the lease. Peter could not only use the Reste Realty case arguing constructive eviction because of constant flooding that was not fixed despite notice and reasonable time and a crowning blow, but could also sue for damages to his business. He could get compensatory damages for his lost profits due to the repairs deterring customers due to the lack of easy access and parking spaces. Lisa would likely win in an argument against saying that that is old property law that has now given way to contract law. Now, in modern law, she would say that at best, Peter would be due a remedy of a portion of his rent equal to the portion taken away and that the construction did not prevent his use of the property as written in the lease. If Peter could not show constructive eviction, he would still have a strong case for a breach of the CQE that would given him a right to damages. He could stay in the property retaining possession and could sue for damages. Since the construction went on much longer than the week, lasting months instead days, the lasting damages to his business adds up over time. He had to keep his windows closed because of the dust, customers and his delivery men were restricted by the scaffolding leading to the back door causing late deliveries and also his parking space is encroached upon. This is similar to the Echo case where construction prevented a business use of their main door and use of the common parking spaces, so the enjoyment of the property as written the lease was not possible. Peter could that would given him a right to damages. He could stay in the property retaining possession and could sue for damages. Since the construction went on much longer than the week, lasting months instead days, the lasting damages to his business adds up over time. He had to keep his windows closed because of the dust, customers and his delivery men were restricted by the scaffolding leading to the back door causing late deliveries and also his parking space is encroached upon. This is similar to the Echo case where construction prevented a business use of their main door and use of the common parking spaces, so the enjoyment of the property as written the lease was not possible. Peter could argue that while he was not effectively evicted through constructive eviction, that the scaffolding maze, closed windows, untimely deliveries and noise from the construction prevented his business' beneficial use of the property. This option is his strongest option becuase it would allow him to not deal with the hassle of moving, but also help make up for the loses in business and annoyance of the repairs. Lisa could argue that he still had use to all the property and while the construction had lasted a couple months, that it was only temporary and she compensated Peter $100 for the prolonged nature mitigating some of the damages. Peter would likely receive damages receiving rent for the period that the CQE breach was in progress. Lastly, if Peter were to claim constructive eviction and move out, but a court ruled that he was still liable for rent for the remainder of the lease, Lisa would have a duty to mitigate the damages despite Peter's breach of contract. Like in Sommer v. Kridel where the landlord was required to take reasonable efforts to fill an abandoned apartment, Lisa would need to either place an ad or show the space to other possible tenants. She wouldn't be required to fill the space if she can't find a new tenant, just make the effort to show. Peter would have the ability to contest that Lisa took reasonable efforts to fill if she is unable to. In the end, Peter most likely will stay in the tenancy and receive compensation for rent during the period of construction and could get compensatory damages for the profits lost compared to profits he would have recieved if the construction was not occuring. He would likely not received constructive eviction, so should not move out abandoning his property. ",1792,1235
d7a73dfa-aa8a-449f-a351-21feff261111," Dana left an ambiguous conveyence making interpretation of the conveyence challenging. Dana's conveyence to Eve includes the words, ""provided that,"" which are indicative of fee simple subject condition subsequent (FSSCS) language. However, Dana's conveyence also includes the words, ""so long as"" which are indicative of fee simple determinable (FSD) language. A FSSCS conveyence includes a future interest in the grantor called ""right of re-entry (ROE)/power of termination."" A FSD conveyence includes a future interest in the grantor called ""possibility of reverter (POR)."" The Mahrenholz case also included an ambiguos conveyence with language similar to Dana's conveyence. The Mahrenholzs tried to bring claim for the property they thought they were conveyed, however the court determined that the initial conveyence was ambiguous and therefore the Mahrenholz were not actually entitled to the property. The Mahrenholz court surprisingly decided to interpret the ambiguous conveyence to favor an FSD over an FSSCS, which is in contrast to what the rules of construction suggest. The rules of construction favor an FSSCS over an FSD when a conveyence is ambigious because the law disfavors forfeiture of property and with a FSD conveyence there is a greater risk of forfeiture of property since the POR right does not need to be affirmatively exercised once the termination event of the conveyence occurs. The holder of POR can be sleeping on his/her rights which could allow for an adverse possessor to take claim of the property, or the POR may never know or exercise this right and the property could be subject to forfeiture. In contrast, with an FSSCS conveyence the ROE/power of termination must be affirmatively exercised by the holder creating less risk for the property to be lost. In this case, the future interest for FSD or FSSCS is in the grantor (Dana), however when Dana passes away she leaves a will that states Fiona (her daughter) inherits all her property. Another rule of construction suggests that conveyences should be interpreted to best match the intent of the grantor. In this case, Dana clearly stipulated she does not want the house to be sold. If Dana were still alive and Eve attempted to sell the house, Dana's future interest (whether POR or ROE/power of termination) could be exercised to retake possession. However, since Dana has passed away and Fiona has inherited all her property, then Fiona can likely exercise the future interest right of the original conveyence by acting on behalf of Dana and her estate. The rules of construction also through the trouble of leaving a will, then it is disfavor partial intestacy meaning that if a grantor 2went reasonable to presume that the grantor intended for his/her property to be inherited/given away and this intention should be honored. Dana were still alive and Eve attempted to sell the house, Dana's future interest (whether POR or ROE/power of termination) could be exercised to retake possession. However, since Dana has passed away and Fiona has inherited all her property, then Fiona can likely exercise the future interest right of the original conveyence by acting on behalf of Dana and her estate. The rules of construction also disfavor partial intestacy meaning that if a grantor went through the trouble of leaving a will, then it is reasonable to presume that the grantor intended for his/her property to be inherited/given away and this intention should be honored. Eve can make a claim that the conveyence Dana left should not be interpretted to have given her a life estate in FSD or FSSCS, but rather that the conveyence should be interpretted to have given Eve Blackacre in fee simple absolute (FSA), which is the champion of all estates and permits her to do whatever she wants with the land. In the White v. Brown case, the grantor left her home to White, without stipulating whether it was in FSA or a life estate, however the grantor did note that her home was not to be sold, and if it was ever sold then it should go to the Browns. White eventually did want to sell the property, but the Browns challenged this claim citing the intent of the grantor/conveyence and claiming that White only was left a life estate. Conversely, White claimed that she was left the estate in FSA since the conveyence failed to indicate that it was only for the duration of her life. The court in this case held that White was left a FSA. The court reasoned that in following the rules of construction and trying to match the original grantor's intent, then the original grantor was capable of indicating that the estate was to be left to White specifically as a life estate, but she did not specifically indicate so and therefore is can be presumed that White was left a FSA. Such an interpretation again matches the rule of construction suggesting that an ambiguous conveyence should be interpretted to favor a FSA, with the rationale being that the law disfavors restraint on alienability and FSA has the most freedom as the champion of all estates. In this case, Eve can make a similar claim to White, by arguing that if Dana had intended for the conveyence to Eve to be only a life estate, then Dana could have been more specific in her conveyence, but she was not and therfore in accordance with precedent from the White v. Brown case and the rules of construction, this ambiguous conveyence should be interpretted to favor a FSA for Eve. If successful in her claim for FSA, then subsequently Eve should be successful in her claim that she should be permitted tot solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre because as holder of Blackacre in FSA, she would have the right to proceed however she wanted to. Fiona can also try to assert a claim for ownership of Blackacre through use of the will left by Dana. As stated above, the rules of constrution suggest honoring a grantor's will, and if ambigous to interpret it as close to the grantor's intent as possible. In this case, Dana's will clearly leaves all her property to Fiona. Therefore, Fiona can claim that she is the owner of Blackacre and in regards to the conveyence that she should be permitted tot solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre because as holder of Blackacre in FSA, she would have the right to proceed however she wanted to. Fiona can also try to assert a claim for ownership of Blackacre through use of the will left by Dana. As stated above, the rules of constrution suggest honoring a grantor's will, and if ambigous to interpret it as close to the grantor's intent as possible. In this case, Dana's will clearly leaves all her property to Fiona. Therefore, Fiona can claim that she is the owner of Blackacre and in regards to the conveyence Dana left Eve, Fiona should claim that she now has the right to act as an agent on behalf of the grantor in that original conveyence. Fiona will likely have the best argument in asserting that the original conveyence is a FSSCS, (as favored by the rules of construction) and that Eve violated the condition when she began soliciting offers for Blackacre and therefore Fiona has the right to re-entry and reclaim possession of Blackacre in FSA. Fiona could also make a similar argument if the ambiguous conveyence was interpretted to be an FSD, like in the Mahrenholz case. If interpretted as an FSD, then Fiona should immediately assert her right of POR in FSA as soon as she discovers Eve is attempting to sell Blackacre. To further strengthen her claim, Fiona can draw from the rule of construction indicating that an ambiguous conveyence should be interpreted to match the intent of the grantor as closely as possible and as such it is very clear that Dana absolutely intended that Blackacre is not to be sold and that intention being so clear in the conveyence should be honored. Fiona also may be successful in bringing claim against Eve for the repairs needed on Blackacre. Fiona can claim that as a tenant of Blackacre, Eve had a duty to not commit waste. There are four forms of waste, affirmative waste which is the actual and willful exploitation or destruction of the property, permissive waste which is neglecting the property through lack of maintanence or failure to pay taxes subjecting the property to deterioration, ameliorative waste which is a change to the property that actually does not decrease its value and may even increase its value, and economic waste which is the property sold for a substantially less than its value. In this case, Fiona may have a claim against Eve for permissive waste. Fiona arrived to Blackacre and found it locked up and deserted, with missing roof shingles, cracked glass and other serious problems. Fiona can argue that the tenant on Blackacre, Eve had a duty to maintain the well being of the house and if such damages occured due to lack of maintence then Eve should also be held responsible for fixing them, paying for them to be fixed, or compensating Fiona for the damage. That said, Fiona's claim for permissive waste against Eve may be weakened if Fiona makes a counter argument that she did not committ permissive waste as she put the real estate taxes on auto-pay so they would be paid annually which shows that she was not negligent in her duties. "," Peter's situation is certainly challenging as he is only at the beginning of his term of years lease with Linda for a duration of 5 years. A term of years lease has a concrete start and end date and automatically terminates at the end date, without requiring advance notice. Unless there is a serious breach by the landlord, a tenant is likely to still be liable for rent payment for the duration of the lease period. In Peter's case, he can try to make a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) by the landlord. There are three different categories under breach of CQE. The first is partial actual eviction, where the tenant is physically deprived of all or part of the premises he rents. The second is constructive eviciton where there is no physical impediment, but actions of the landlord are so tantamount that they deprive the tenant of beneficial use and enjoyment of the property he is paying for to the point where the tennant must vacate the premises. The third is a claim for damages for breach of CQE where the landlord is responsible for incoveniences the tennant has suffered which have deprived him of full beneficial use of the property, but where the inconveniences are not significant enough to rise to the level of constructive eviction. In the Echo consulting case, a tennant Bank was inconvenienced by construction sanctioned by the landlord, part of which deprived the tennant of accessing one of the two entrances used regulalry. The tenannt sued for partial actual eviction claiming (among other things) that loss of access to one of the primary entrances was partial actual eviction of the premises being rented. However, the court ruled that the lease provisions stated that the tennant is to have access to at least one entrance at all times, there was no specification as to which one, and since the tennant did have access to another entrance, then the claim for partial actual eviction was invalid. In Peter's case, he is suffering from not being able to use the back entrance of the building as easily as before because of the construction scaffolding across the rear of the building. However, Peter still has access to the primary entrance for his shop. Similar to the Echo lease, Peter's lease does not specify which doors he must have access to at all times, just that he is entitled to a common right of access, therefore the lease provision is likely not violated by the back door becoming harder to access and a claim of partial actual eviction on this premises would likely be weak. That said, Peter is suffering from inconveniences brought about by the construction sanctioned by Linda. In the Reste Realty case, a tennant suffered from recurring flooding which she informed her construction scaffolding across the rear of the building. However, Peter still has access to the primary entrance for his shop. Similar to the Echo lease, Peter's lease does not specify which doors he must have access to at all times, just that he is entitled to a common right of access, therefore the lease provision is likely not violated by the back door becoming harder to access and a claim of partial actual eviction on this premises would likely be weak. That said, Peter is suffering from inconveniences brought about by the construction sanctioned by Linda. In the Reste Realty case, a tennant suffered from recurring flooding which she informed her landlord about, but which the landlord did not fix. Finally, after the flooding became so serious that the tennant had to cancel and move an important business meeting to another location, she sent her landlord a notice that she would be evicting the premises due to the flooding issues. When the landlord brought claim against the tennat for the rest of the rent payment, the court ruled in favor of the tennant's constructive eviction claim. The court reasoned that the tennant was significantly deprived of the beneficial use and enjoyment of the property she was paying for due to a structural defect the land lord was responsible for fixing but refused to do so. As such, by way of giving notice to the landlord and then vacating the premise, the tennat was able to bring forth a constructive eviction claim, and subsequently was successful in her claim. In this case, Peter can claim his business was suffering due to the lengthy construction, the excessive noise and dust, the trouble of the staff being able to efficiently make deliveries, the scaffolding along the building where most customers entered and the construction equipment encroaching on Peter's designated parking spot which he was entitled to as a provision of his lease. As the tennant in Reste Realty did, Peter also notfied Linda of the issues. In contrast to the landlord in Reste Realty, Linda was sympathetic to Peter's plight and tried to remedy the situation by deducting from his rent. However, the 1-2 week construction project turned into months and Peter's revenues are suffering. If Peter feels strongly that the inconveniences suffered are so tantamount that he is not able to conduct business in this location anymore, then he can bring a claim for constructive eviction, however he must give Linda notice he is moving out and then he must actually vacate the premises in order to be able to bring the constructive eviction claim. Peter can withhold rent payment, however he should be advised to put the money in an escrow account, because if he does not win in court for his claim of constructive eviction then he will still be responsible for the rest of the rent payment. Alternative to the constructive eviction claim, Peter could remain on the premises and do the best he can to run his business, but bring a claim for damages against Linda for breach of CQE. Peter could claim that all the aforementioned issues he has been inconvenienced with have deprived him of the beneficial use and enjoyment of the property he is6paying for, but are not so tantamount that he must vacate the premises, but he should still be compensated for the problems he's suffered. Bringing a claim for damages due to breach of CQE would not relieve Peter of his rent obligations for the remainder of court for his claim of constructive eviction then he will still be responsible for the rest of the rent payment. Alternative to the constructive eviction claim, Peter could remain on the premises and do the best he can to run his business, but bring a claim for damages against Linda for breach of CQE. Peter could claim that all the aforementioned issues he has been inconvenienced with have deprived him of the beneficial use and enjoyment of the property he is paying for, but are not so tantamount that he must vacate the premises, but he should still be compensated for the problems he's suffered. Bringing a claim for damages due to breach of CQE would not relieve Peter of his rent obligations for the remainder of the lease. Peter does not have a claim against Linda for breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability (IWH) like in the Hilder v. St. Peter case as the IWH applies only to residential properties. The old common law held the position of ""caveat emptor"" meaning tennat/buyer beware which suggested that a tennant was to enter into a lease agreement under his own discretion and any inconveniences or interferences he suffered during his lease term he must handle with his own discretion, the responsibillity did not fall on landlord. Today's modern law has shifted towards a policy that puts more responsibility on the landlord. The landlord has a duty to upohold the covenant of quiet enjoyment, meaning the land lord should not do or sanction anything that would interfere with the tennat's right to the beneficial use and enjoyment of the enitre premises he is paying for. Even if only a small part of the tennat's premises was encroached upon, like the Smith v. McCany brick wall case, the small onbstruction can constitute a partial eviction because the policy is that the tennat has a right to the entire premises he is paying for a eviction of any part can qualify as eviction from the entire premises. The old common law (American Rule) said the tennant was responsible for dealing with any issues faced during his lease. However, in the modern rule (English Rule), a landlord is responsible for handing over the premises to the tennant and getting rid of any holdover tennants (lease has expired but they haven't left yet) and for dealing with any interferences during the lease term by those with paramount title (i.e. mortgage lenders). The landlord is not responsible for dealing with interferences during the lease term which the landlord has not caused or sanctitoned, but if the landlord has caused or sanctioned such interferences (i.e. construction workers) then the landlord could be held liable. In Peter's case, Linda did sanction the construction on the building, which interferred with Peter's right to CQE and therefore she could be held liable for any breaches of CQE. If Peter does decide that he must vacate the premises, he may still be held responsible for rent payment unless a court rules otherwise. Regardless of whether a court rules in favor of relieving Peter of his rent duty or not, if he vacates the premises then Linda has a duty to mitigate damages. The old common law did not impose this duty and instead stated a tennant was free to remain in his rental premises or not, but regardless he was still responsible for his rent for the duration of the lease and the therefore she could be held liable for any breaches of CQE. If Peter does decide that he must vacate the premises, he may still be held responsible for rent payment unless a court rules otherwise. Regardless of whether a court rules in favor of relieving Peter of his rent duty or not, if he vacates the premises then Linda has a duty to mitigate damages. The old common law did not impose this duty and instead stated a tennant was free to remain in his rental premises or not, but regardless he was still responsible for his rent for the duration of the lease and the landlord did not have to try to mitigate such damages. However, as seen in the Sommer v. Kridel case, the modern law has shifted to favor a policy where a landlord does have the duty to mitigate damages if a tennant vacates the premises before the end of the lease. In Sommer v. Kridel, the tennant informed the landlord that due to personal circumstances he was no longer able to move into the rental property or pay the rest of the rent. The landlord brought suit against the tenant 15 months later for the remainder of the rent, however the court held the tennant was not liable for this rent payment because the landlord did not fulfil his duty to mitigate damages. The landlord had a duty to make reasonable efforts to relet the premises to try and compensate for the rent lost, but he did not make any effort to do so, and even turned down interested renters. As such the court reasoned because the landlord breached his duty to mitigate damages, then the tennant did not have to pay the rest of the rent even though he vacated the property before the end of the lease. All of this is to say that if Peter decides to vacate early, and down the line Linda brings a claim againt him for the remaining rent, there is a chance a court could rule Peter is not liable for the rest of the rent, if Linda cannot prove she made a good faith effort to mitigate damages by attempting to relet the property. That said, Peter should not rely on this situation happenning and relieving him of the rent payment because Linda could certainly attempt to relet the property, or a court may even reason that the duty to mitigate damages pertains more strongly to residential properties than to commericial properties. As such Peter is not advised to rely heavily on this duty to mitigate damagaes. Given the totality of circumstances in Peter and Linda's situation, it is likely in his best interest to either remain in the property and potentially bring a claim for damages of CQE, which may or may not be successful, or he and Linda might be able to find common ground to agree to terminate the lease early. However, if Linda does not agree to accept Peter's early termination and vacating of the premises, or if a court does not rule Peter is relieved of his duty to pay rent, then there is no guarentee that Peter will not have to pay rent for the five year lease.

0cd9b843-be11-4595-847f-4b89f6644253," Essay 1: Interest in land at conveyance: When Dana wrote the conveyance she used the conditional language of ""provided that"" but also the durational language of ""so long as"", this creates a ambiguous conveyance. The conditional language would create a fee simple subject to condiditon subsequent (FSSCS), while the durational language would alone create a fee simple determinable (FSD). The rules of construction aim to look at the intent of the grantor. Given the language that Dana added to the conveyance ""the house should not be sold"" and her clear action of giving the property to her close cousin instead of selling when she moved to Switzerland, Dana's intention was to keep Blackacre in the family. She added a total restraint on alienation of Blackacre. When Dana died her future interest in Blackacre would have tranferred to Fiona, because her deed left all personal property to Fiona. As stated in the instructions all future interests are devisable through the death of the present interest holder. So, Fiona either has a Right of Entry (ROE) if the conveyance is a FSSCS or she has a Possibility of Reverter (POR) if the conveyance is a FSD. Following the intent of Dana at the time of the conveyance, if she did not want the land to be sold, it would make more sense for there to be a POR because this is an automatic transfer of the interest in the land. This transfer, here from Eve to Fiona, would prevent the sale of the land if and when Eve attempted to sale. If the conveyance is a FSSCS then Fiona would need to be made aware that Eve was attempting to sell the land and Fiona would need to exercised her ROE to prevent the sale. To hold with the intent of the grantor in the original conveyance it would be most logical if the court were to find that Eve held Blackacre in FSD with a POR. The POR was originally with Dana, but when she died her interest was divised to her daughter Fiona. Eve was offered a substantial amount of money for Blackacre and is unsure if she is able to look for other offers because of the conveyance language. Merely looking at the conveyance language, she cannot. As of the first offer, which was uninvited by Eve, she has not yet broken the conveyance. She did not attempt to sell the land by receiving an offer. But if she were to begin to market the property and reach out to other, then she would be violating the conveyance from Dana. Eve does have a very weak arguement to sell the land in order to make a profit because some courts consider it waste to allow the originally with Dana, but when she died her interest was divised to her daughter Fiona. Eve was offered a substantial amount of money for Blackacre and is unsure if she is able to look for other offers because of the conveyance language. Merely looking at the conveyance language, she cannot. As of the first offer, which was uninvited by Eve, she has not yet broken the conveyance. She did not attempt to sell the land by receiving an offer. But if she were to begin to market the property and reach out to other, then she would be violating the conveyance from Dana. Eve does have a very weak arguement to sell the land in order to make a profit because some courts consider it waste to allow the property not to be used in the most economically benefitial way. But, the court in (the case involving the widowed wife and the husband's grandchildren) held that economic benefit to the present interest holder is not the only factor to consider when determining to sell the land. Further, here we have clear intention by the original grantor not to sell the land. Also, this arguement is outweighed by Fiona's sentimental interest. Fiona wants to take possession of the property because upon her most recent visit she became sentimental and recalled how much the property meant to her and her mother. If Eve starts to attempt to sell the property in breach of the conveyance, as discussed above, Fiona automatically gains present interest in Blackacre through the POR. But Fiona could argue that by entertaining the offer by the real estate developer, Eve is 'attempting to sell' the property, already violating the FSD laid out in the conveyance. Meaning that Fiona already has the interest in Blackacre. Fiona has the stronger arguement because once Eve starts to market and attempt to sell the property, she will have ownership rights. If Eve argues that selling the land is the best economic use for the property, it is likely that the court will find that Fiona's interests are greater. Regardless of the conveyance, the court could review what is the best use of the land to determine what to allow. The economic use of the land is always a profitable and benefitial use of the land, but Fiona's sentimental interest is not something that can be replaced by other parcels of land. In Ark Land the lower court held that the increase in economical use of the land was a good enough reason to allow the land to be partitioned by sale. The higher court held that although the economic beneift can be weighed, the court also has to look at the interst of all parties. Fiona was raised in this home living with her mother. The lose of her mother and her return to the property prompted new found sentimental feelings towards the property. Her mother obtained this property from her parents, so it has been in the family for generations. But, Eve does not share these sentimental feelings and could argue that Fiona did not want to live in the property when her mother offered it to her. Fiona was living in NYC and expressed her desire to not move back to New Suffolk. So, Eve could argue that there is not such a deep sentimental tie to the property as Fiona would claim. the court also has to look at the interst of all parties. Fiona was raised in this home living with her mother. The lose of her mother and her return to the property prompted new found sentimental feelings towards the property.

Fiona was living in NYC and expressed her desire to not move back to New Suffolk. So, Eve could argue that there is not such a deep sentimental tie to the property as Fiona would claim. As for the damages sustained to the property while it was under Eve's possession. If the property is to go to Fiona because of a breach of the conveyance by Eve, Eve may be held responsable for missing roof shingles, cracked glass, and other serious problems. The present interest on a premise is to deliver the property to the future interest in a condition simialr to which they receive it. Because Eve left the property during her possession, she allowed the property to become delapidated and deteriorated by the rough New Suffolk winters. This is considered permissive waste. If Fiona is granted possession of the property it is likely that the court would find that Eve is responsible for the repairs needed for the property because Eve did not take care of the property as required by the common law. "," Peter needs advice on what he can do to end his term of years lease with Linda, his landlord (LL). If there is a breach of the lease by the LL, then Peter would be able to leave the premise and not be responsible for the remaining months' rent. But, if Peter left and there was not a breach by the LL then he would be liable for the rent. In the latter situation, the LL would have to show the court that they attempted to mitigate their losses by attempting to relet the property to another tenant. The main issue becomes, did the LL breach the lease allowing Peter to leave without consequence? The most applicable rule is the convenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE). This is the tenant's ability to freely use the land and not be interrupted by the actions, or lack thereof, of the LL. The CQE has evolved from the modern law approach to treating property law as contract law. The modern approach makes the payment of the rent by the tenant reliant on the conditions set forth by the LL of the premise. The older approach would require that tenants on the law pay the rent, but also maintain the buidling and do any necessary repairs. Modern society expects that the4 tenant not be responsible for the upkeep of the propery as much because the LL is usually going to know more of the issues and be financially able to handled the costs of the repairs. Unlikey historically where the tenant was knowledgable to handle the the land and not be interrupted by the actions, or lack thereof, of the LL. The CQE has evolved from the modern law approach to treating property law as contract law.

Modern society expects that the tenant not be responsible for the upkeep of the propery as much because the LL is usually going to know more of the issues and be financially able to handled the costs of the repairs. Unlikey historically where the tenant was knowledgable to handle the repairs on the property. The breach of CQE is of three types. The first is actual evcition, either partial or total. This is where the LL dispossess the tenant from the land. In the brick wall case (Smith) partial actual eviction can be quiet small, only by a few inches. The brick wall that was put in, by the LL, prevented the tenant from using the land for the purposes that it was intended for. Here, the actual eviction is only applicable to the parking spot. The construction, which was sanctioned by the LL, encroaches on the parking spot which is designated for Peter's use in the lease agreement. Peter has a weak arguement for this because the encroachment is not so much as to render the spot useless. If he was not able to use the spot at all, then his arguement would be stronger. Peter provides that he is able to use the spot to park, the construction makes it tight and more difficult. Because this is the only example of actual eviciton, it is unlikely that a court would find the CQE was breached in this manner because the tenant usually has to leave the premise before claiming this. Peter was still able to run the business while the construction happened for a short while. There was not crowning blow causing him to up and leave. The Smith case also introduces the idea of the Restatement of Property which offers in these situations a renegotiation of the rent for the lesser amount of property. Since the parking spot is encroached upon, Linda deducted $100 from the rent. This renegotation is the type of equitable solution that the Restatement calls for. The second type of breach of CQE is constructive eviction. This is where the actions of the LL distrupt the use of the land so much it is ""as if"" the tenant has been evicted. Peter's situation is very similar to the situation in Echo. In that case, there was construction, dirt, and noise which interferred with the tenants use of the land. Futher, the construction obstucted use of one of the more convient entrances to the building for the tenant. Here, Peter's business is being disrupted by the construction. The customers are less likely to fight through the construction work to visit the pizza shop and deliveries are effected by the inability to use the back door. Although Peter's sales are negatively affected, it is unlikely that a court would find that he has been constructively evicted. The use of the back door was not included in the lease. The lease provides that there be a common right if access, which is the front door. The rest of the units use the front door off of Main Street, which would make that the common right of access. The use use of the land. Futher, the construction obstucted use of one of the more convient entrances to the building for the tenant. Here, Peter's business is being disrupted by the construction. The customers are less likely to fight through the construction work to visit the pizza shop and deliveries are effected by the inability to use the back door. Although Peter's sales are negatively affected, it is unlikely that a court would find that he has been constructively evicted. The use of the back door was not included in the lease. The lease provides that there be a common right if access, which is the front door. The rest of the units use the front door off of Main Street, which would make that the common right of access. The use of the back door, now inability to use back door, does not breach the CQE because it is not agreed upon in the lease. This is the same situation as Echo. Because the express use of that specific door is not included in the lease, it cannot be a breach of CQE by now obstructing that door. Even though that door is more convient. The other arguement for constructive eviction is the parking spot. This is specifically given in the lease. The constrution is making it very difficult to use, making it ""as if"" he was evicted from the spot. The counter arguement would be the same as above, the spot is still useable. The arguement for constructive eviction is stronger than the arguement for actual eviciton. In Echo the court found no constructive eviction because the problem was not continuous. Here, Peter has been dealing with this for month. There does not seem to be a reasonable end time any time soon. This could be an arguement for constructive eviction here and not in Echo. But, it is also possible, more likely, that the court will find that there is no constructive eviction here because of the strong similarities in the cases. To claim constructive eviction, the tenant needs to leave the premise as well. The strongest claim for breach of CQE is for damages. The tenant does not usually have to leave to claim this. This is when there is a breach, but it did not raise to the level on constructive or actual eviction. The construction is causing Peter lose of business. He could sue Linda for this to recoup some of the damages he suffered by this long term construction. The Echo case held that although there was no constructive eviction, there was a claim for damages. Similarly, Peter's case looks like Echo, so it is likely that the court would find the same. Linda's counter agruement would be that it is not her fault that his customers will not enter the building. She may have to do these repairs to keep the building up to code. She has already renegotiated the price and asked him to be patient. She was not aware that the repairs would take months, because she advised Peter only weeks. I would advise Peter that his strongest claim is the breach of CQE and he is entitled to damages, possibily equating to the amount he has lost in business. But, if he does want to leave the premise and stop paying rent, the LL has to show an attempt to mitigate losses. If there was no breach and Peter left, Linda would have to show the court that she tried6toofrelet 7 the property to another tenant. If she get another tenant, Peter would not be liable. If she was unable and did not put a good faith effort into reletting, then he also may be off the hook for the remaining months rent. But, if Linda shows a good repairs would take months, because she advised Peter only weeks. I would advise Peter that his strongest claim is the breach of CQE and he is entitled to damages, possibily equating to the amount he has lost in business. But, if he does want to leave the premise and stop paying rent, the LL has to show an attempt to mitigate losses. If there was no breach and Peter left, Linda would have to show the court that she tried to relet the property to another tenant. If she get another tenant, Peter would not be liable. If she was unable and did not put a good faith effort into reletting, then he also may be off the hook for the remaining months rent. But, if Linda shows a good faith effort and is still unable to relet, the Peter will be liable for the future month's rent. I would advise Peter to stay for now. Stop paying rent to put the burden on Linda to take him to court. Once he stopped paying, Linda would be able to evict him without going through the court system. In restaurant case, the court held that LL cannot use self help methods because they are inhernetly not peaceable. So, by witholding the rent, Peter would put the financial burden on Linda to file suit. At that time, he would be able to claim breach of CQE for damages for lost business. Without making Peter move, the damages are the strongest case he has for the interferance of his use of the property. ",1281,1751
43084736-44a9-470a-b489-78a88e9cf1fa," 1. Dana had Blackacre in fee simple absolute (FSA) when she conveyed the property to Eve. Dana's conveyance to Eve is ambiguous, so the courts would look to the rules of contruction to find what established category the conveyance falls into under the numerus clausus principle. Eve has an interest in selling the house, so she will argue for a FSA. Under the rules of construction, courts favor a FSA over other types of estate, so Eve has a head start in arguing for this type of interest. The courts also favor free alienablilty of property to promote economic and beneficial use of property. The conveyance to Eve has a total restraint on selling the house. Courts have traditionally disallowed total restraints on sale on both FSA and life estates (LE). While the language ""provided that"" and ""so long as"" seems to make the restraint a condtition, a court would still likely rule the no sale clause is void. This was seen in White v. Brown, where the court ruled that the no sale clause was void and read the ambiguous conveyance as a FSA, even though it mentioned the duration for White's life. The court did this to achieve property without restriction, and avoid a judicial sale that would not benefit all parties. Fiona would have to argue the conveyance set up a life estate in Eve if she would like to keep the property in the family. While the languge of the conveyance does not measure the duration in Eve's life, she may argue the intent of Dana was to keep the property in the family. A court would most satisfy Dana's intent of keeping the property in the family by establishing a life estate, where Eve would not be able to sell the future interest in the property. Fiona could cite the Marenholz's case, where the court disregarded the rules of construction and assigned a fee simple determinable (FSD) over a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS). This could be used to argue that favoring a FSA over a LE should be disregarded in this case to achieve the intent of Dana. She could further argue that Dana gave all of her personal property to Fiona, so she is aware of how to devise property in FSA, yet she choose to use a more restrictive conveyance. Fiona could cite the dissent in the White case to support her argument, where a similar conveyance of personal property was made and the conveyance was abmiguous. Fiona may also argue the alienability is set up as a condition to the conveyance, and not the traditional alienability restraints that courts have not allowed, but it is a weaker argument. A court would likely rule that the the coneyance 2was a FSA in Eve, with no restraint on alienability following the White case. The rules of construction favor this argument and the courts have traditionally favored property that is able to be transferred to be used in the best economic way. This is to use a more restrictive conveyance. Fiona could cite the dissent in the White case to support her argument, where a similar conveyance of personal property was made and the conveyance was abmiguous. Fiona may also argue the alienability is set up as a condition to the conveyance, and not the traditional alienability restraints that courts have not allowed, but it is a weaker argument. A court would likely rule that the the coneyance was a FSA in Eve, with no restraint on alienability following the White case. The rules of construction favor this argument and the courts have traditionally favored property that is able to be transferred to be used in the best economic way. This is also favored by the state of New Suffolk. Eve would be able to sell the property if she recieved a FSA. If Fiona could succeed in her claim that the conveyance set up a LE, she then has an argument for waste and for Eve to fix the property. If it was a life estate, Blackacre returns to the estate by reversion upon Eve's death. Fiona is the issue of Dana so she would get the interest in Blackacre. Eve locked the house up and left when Dana died. The house then had structural issues from the neglect. This negligance would likely be found to be permissive waste by a court. Eve had a responsibility to future interest, Fiona, to deliver the property in a substantially similar condition as they recieved it, which is not the case here. Still assuming a LE, Eve could claim that this waste was actually ameliorative waste. While it is true she let the house sit and decay, the property value increased over that time. She could cite Woodrick v. Wood, where the court held Ohio did not follow the common law of ameilorative waste and removing a barn was not improper so long as it improved the property value. Eve would first need to argue the courts should not follow the common law ban on ameilorative waste. She could argue courts should encourage the rise of property value. She must also then convince them that the waste was a volutary act. She could argue she voluntarily left the house to decay and increase in value. A court would likely rule that the waste came from negligance and was not voluntary. On top of that, Fiona would likely argue the property would likely be more valuable with a nice house on it. In other words, the permissive waste caused a dip in the property value that was hidden by a rise from outside factors. If Eve had a LE, and still wanted to sell, she has one argument to rest on. Courts have ruled in the Baker case that if a party's interests are served and the future interest is not prejudiced, a life tenant can sell a property under the theory of economic waste. Eve could argue the property value has never been higher, and could be put to better use by a real estate developer. She could also cite Ark land's dissent that argued the economic interest of the land is important, especially when no one is living in the home full time. Not developing the land would deprive builders of jobs and tenants of homes or work space. Therefore, the developer is more beneficial than an empty home. Fiona would likely rebutt this with the Baker case, whose plaintiff was a struggling old women. Her Baker case that if a party's interests are served and the future interest is not prejudiced, a life tenant can sell a property under the theory of economic waste. Eve could argue the property value has never been higher, and could be put to better use by a real estate developer. She could also cite Ark land's dissent that argued the economic interest of the land is important, especially when no one is living in the home full time. Not developing the land would deprive builders of jobs and tenants of homes or work space. Therefore, the developer is more beneficial than an empty home. Fiona would likely rebutt this with the Baker case, whose plaintiff was a struggling old women. Her interests would surely be benefitted by a sale, and the court still ruled against it. Eve wants to sell to pad her own pockets and not out of a dire need. Furthermore, the property value may continue to rise, which means a sale now that went into a trust for Fiona would hurt her in the future, if the values continued to rise. She may also use the courts reasoning in Ark land, which gave deference to the connection to a home. If this theory is applied to economic waste as well, Fiona's interest in her childhood home would have to be taken into account. A court would likely rule that Fiona would not be able to sell under the theory of economic waste, due to the sale not benefitting a party enough, and prejudice against Fiona. "," Peter has a term of years lease with Linda, which means if he vacates and the court finds against him he will be on the hook for all missed rent for the lease. Therefore, Peter must have cause to leave and he would likely look to the covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) to justify leaving. The CQE in commercial spaces proctects tenants from landlord's actions involving actual eviction, constructive eviction, and damages. Under the actual eviction, Peter could argue that the contruction equipment in his spot could consititute actual eviction. Citing the Smith case, all the rent comes from all land conveyed in the lease. The parking spot was conveyed in the lease to Peter so it should be covered. Under the Smith case, it any doesn't matter that the lot was still usuable because encroachment negated the whole rent. Linda could counter and say while one spot was taken by the equipment, there was a whole lot of spots that could be designated to Peter. He would still have a designated spot like the lease, but the lease doesn't eviction, and damages. Under the actual eviction, Peter could argue that the contruction equipment in his spot could consititute actual eviction. Citing the Smith case, all the rent comes from all land conveyed in the lease. The parking spot was conveyed in the lease to Peter so it should be covered. Under the Smith case, it doesn't matter that the lot was still usuable because any encroachment negated the whole rent. Linda could counter and say while one spot was taken by the equipment, there was a whole lot of spots that could be designated to Peter. He would still have a designated spot like the lease, but the lease doesn't specify which spot is designated. Peter would have to leave the premises to be able to claim actual eviction, and since he is not deprived used of the business or the spot, it is likely a court would rule that no actual eviction took place. Peter may also cite constructive eviciton (CE) under the CQE. If the interference was so substiantial that it interfered with the leased purpose of the space, a court may rule that the CQE was breached by CE. He may claim that the back door was blocked by scaffolding so severly that even though it was usuable, it may as well as deprived access. Peter may also argue that the dust and noise of the construction severly interrupt his buisness. Linda may cite the Echo case, which has facts similar to the door blockage and noise. A court ruled that the business in Echo had another entrance to the property, and contruction was not substantially enough interfering with the business to constitute CE. Peter may cite Reste, which held that an interference does not have to be continous to constitute CE. Peter could argue that while the noise, dirt, and blockage stop at certain points, Linda's promise to last a week which has dragged months could be continous enough to be CE. Peter would also have to notify Linda of the significant interference, and give reasonable time to fix. It seems here he has done that, but he would also need to leave in a timely manner. The months may not be a timely enough exit by Peter, and Linda could cite Reste saying there was no crowning blow. However, Peter may argue the lost revenue and latest lies from Linda was the crowning blow. A court would likely find that the case is similar to Echo, that the door was not the only right of entry or promised specifically in the lease and the noise and dirt are temporary. Therefore, they would likely rule this is not a CE. Peter's best chance at a solution would be recovering damages. The Echo case held that even if actual or constructive eviction were not met, a tenant could still recieve damages. The court did this to protect tenants and not allow issues to rise to evicition before they could be handled judicially. Peter could argue the intereference has substantially hurt revenue and reputatation, and Linda was in the best position as the landlord to give an accurate estimation of the timeline. Linda could counter that the $100 deduction in rent covered the inconvience. She may also argue caveat emptor, or that Peter assumed the defects when he signed and resigned the lease. Peter could cite Reste, arguing the courts have Peter's best chance at a solution would be recovering damages.

Linda could counter that the $100 deduction in rent covered the inconvience. She may also argue caveat emptor, or that Peter assumed the defects when he signed and resigned the lease. Peter could cite Reste, arguing the courts have moved away from caveat emptor to protect tenants because landlords have more power and are better able to fix issues. Like Reste the defects was outside the building and possibly beyond the lease's scope, meaning it would be the landlord's duty to know about it and not Peter. A court would likely find that Peter is entitled to damages because the modern approach moves away from Caveat emptor and $100 a month is not enough to cover lost revenues. If Peter does abandon the lease, and he is liable for it Linda may still have to mitigate damages. Under Sommer v. Kridel, the landlord left the leased space open by neglecting tenants that asked for it, then tried to collect the rent from the former tenant. The court ruled that this is predatory and leaves leaseable space open unneccesarliy. Landlords therefore have an obligation to reasonable diligence to fill abandoned spaces. If Linda does not put ads out or hire a real estate agent to fill the space, then Peter may not be liable to Linda for the rent. Linda has the burden to prove she gave reasonable diligence to filling the space, but this is a risky strategy because Peter remains on the hook if she tries and fails to fill it. ",1342,1076
b2a62af1-d571-48c7-bece-f369e4005ea1," At the time of Dana's conveyance, Eve had a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS), and Dana had the power of termination/right of entry in fee simple absolute (FSA). After Dana's death, Fiona inherited Dana's power of termination/right of entry in FSA, and Eve maintained her FSSCS. The conveyance will be interpreted as such due to the rules of statutory interpretation. The conveyance should be read to achieve the intent of the grantor, and in this case Dana was very clear that she did not want Blackacre to be sold. Conveyances should also be read to favor a FSSCS over a fee simple determinable (FSD), and in this case, the language in the conveyance could be read either under terms of duration or conditionally. Because of that ambiguous language, and to preserve that the conveyance should be read as a whole and to avoid partial intestacy, Eve has a FSSCS, and Dana has the power of termination/right of entry. This is very similar to the dissent in White v Brown, wherein the dissenting judge thought that the conveyance was clear enough that the intent of the grantor could be understood and achieved. Just as in that case, the grantor was explicit that they did not want their home to be sold, and this conveyance should be read to achieve that intent. When there is a defeasible fee, there must always be a corresponding future interest. Dana retained that interest in the original conveyance, and Fiona inherited it at her death, which is why Fiona's interest is a right of entry/power of termination, rather than a shifting executory interest. Eve can make a weak argument that conveyances should always be read to favor free alienability, and so she should be allowed to sell Blackacre. She can also point to New Suffolk's General Laws to make a claim that the restraint on her FSSCS is void because Dana's intent was not clear enough to have been expressly given or necessarily implied. A more substantial argument for Eve is that Fiona has not yet exercised her power of termination, and that Eve hasn't even violated the condition. The condition in the conveyance states that Eve cannot attempt to sell the house. Here, Eve has not attempted to sell the house, rather she was given an offer for Blackacre, and so there was no action by Eve to alienate Blackacre. This is like the Mahrenholz case, where the school board was still technically using the property for school-related activities, even though they were only using it for storage. Because the specific language of the conveyance has not been 2violated, Eve can hear offers for the sale of Blackacre, so long as she does not make an actual attempt to sell the house. At that point, Fiona would be able to step in with her right of entry/power of termination. conveyance states that Eve cannot attempt to sell the house. Here, Eve has not attempted to sell the house, rather she was given an offer for Blackacre, and so there was no action by Eve to alienate Blackacre. This is like the Mahrenholz case, where the school board was still technically using the property for school-related activities, even though they were only using it for storage. Because the specific language of the conveyance has not been violated, Eve can hear offers for the sale of Blackacre, so long as she does not make an actual attempt to sell the house. At that point, Fiona would be able to step in with her right of entry/power of termination. Eve can also make the argument that not selling Blackacre would be economic waste, because letting the house sit vacant is not the optimal use of the property. Perhaps Eve and Fiona could reach an agreement similar to the one found in Baker v Weedon, where the remaindermen agreed to sell off the farm in order to benefit both parties. If both Eve and Fiona can agree to a selling price, then there would be an equitable outcome. If however, Fiona does not wish to sell Blackacre because of emotional attachment or longstanding family ownership, her future interest cannot be divested by the present interest holder of a defeasible fee. Fiona can argue that Eve did violate the condition when she heard an offer for Blackacre, because it went against Dana's intent when she conveyed Blackacre to Eve. If the condition was violated, then Fiona is within her rights to use her right of entry and deprive Eve of her interest in Blackacre. If, however, Eve is not found to have violated the condition, then Fiona may still be able to hold Eve liable for repairs to the property, under the principle of waste. Present interest holders are supposed to maintain the property so that future interest holders acquire the property in the same state as the present interest holders did. In this case, the damage to the house is indicative of permissive waste. The cracked glass, missing roof shingles, and other serious problems are all issues that Eve has a responsibility to repair before Fiona acquires Blackacre. Since the specific condition is the conveyance has not yet been violated, if Eve allows Fiona to live at Blackacre, it would be a landlord-tenant situation, because Eve still has her present interest in Blackacre. However, even in a tenancy at will, Eve would have a responsibility to deliver Blackacre to Fiona in a state of habitability, and so if Fiona does move back to Blackacre, then Eve will have a responsibility to fix any issues that would affect Fiona's ability to live at the house. If Eve refuses to pay for the repairs, and Fiona decides not to move back to Blackacre as a result, then Eve will not be obligated to repair the home until Fiona is able to exercise her power of termination. "," The issue is whether Linda has violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) with Peter, and if Peter can abandon his term-of-years lease without paying the full term of rent. Peter should look through three levels of analysis to determine if Linda has breached the CQE: partial actual eviction, constructive eviction, and damages. A partial actual eviction has occurred if the landlord's actions leave part of leased premises unusable by the tenant. Under the old common law rule, if any part of the premises becomes unusable, then the tenant is entitled to a total abatement of all rent. The policy rationale for this is to prevent the landlord from slowly taking back bits and pieces of the land. The modern rule limits recovery, so that instead of total abatement of rent, the tenant is entitled to proportional relief, usually be lowering rent. In this case, Peter may argue that the construction company has encroached upon the parking space that the lease designated to him. The equipment does go over the white line, but Peter can still park in his spot. This is somewhat similar, but slightly different to the brick wall in the Smith v McEnany case. There, the brick wall made a portion of the back yard completely unusable. Here, the equipment makes it harder for Peter to park in his space, but it is still possible for him to do so. Since he can still use the parking space given to him in the lease, he has not been partially actually evicted. In addition, Peter can make a weaker argument that the scaffolding near the back entrance has lessened access from the rear parking lot. Since the door is still technically usable, although difficult to use, and the common lot technically still available, there has not been partial actual eviction here either. Constructive eviction occurs when due to landlord action or inaction, a problem becomes so bad that the tenant is forced to leave. In order to successfully allege constructive eviction, a tenant must notify the landlord of the issue, give the landlord a reasonable time to address the issue, and then the tenant must leave in a reasonable time. Here, Peter did notify Linda of the issues he has been having with the construction, such as the large amount of dust, and the difficulty his employees and customers have accessing the store. She did lower his rent, but told him to just be patient. The construction continued for a few more months, even though Linda told Peter at the outset that the construction would only take one week. This was more than a reasonable time to address the issue, but Peter is losing money as a result of the delays in construction. If the issue continues, and assuming Peter abandons the lease within the landlord of the issue, give the landlord a reasonable time to address the issue, and then the tenant must leave in a reasonable time. Here, Peter did notify Linda of the issues he has been having with the construction, such as the large amount of dust, and the difficulty his employees and customers have accessing the store. She did lower his rent, but told him to just be patient. The construction continued for a few more months, even though Linda told Peter at the outset that the construction would only take one week. This was more than a reasonable time to address the issue, but Peter is losing money as a result of the delays in construction. If the issue continues, and assuming Peter abandons the lease within a reasonable time, then he may be able to successfully allege constructive eviction, but only after he leaves. However, Peter may be able to collect damages from Linda even without taking the drastic step of abandoning his lease. The court in the Echo Consulting case gave an option for a tenant to remain and seek damages for the violation of CQE, instead of waiting for things to get so bad that the tenant has to leave. Just like in that case, where the construction made things more inconvenient for the employees to get to the building and the loud noises made it difficult for them to conduct business, the construction occurring on Main Street has cost Peter money, and affected the speediness of his shop's deliveries. Even without leaving, in this case, Peter should be able to seek damages from Linda, possibly in the form of a renegotiated lease, further lowering his rent, or by withholding rent and putting it in escrow until the construction is actually finished. If Peter does abandon his lease, and he is found to be liable to pay Linda for the full rent, Linda still has a duty to mitigate damages by making a good faith effort to re-let the premises, just as seen in Sommer v Kridel. The rationale for this is to prevent landlords from leaving property vacant so that they can collect more money from the tenants that abandoned the lease. In addition, Linda will bear the burden of proof to show her effort to fill the vacancy, because as the landlord she is better positioned to produce evidence to that effect. If Peter does end up abandoning his lease, then he may need to pay additional rent to Linda, but only until Linda can fill the vacancy he left behind. In another scenario, Peter and Linda could mutually agree to a surrender of the lease, in which case Peter would not be responsible for paying additional rent. A reason to come to this outcome would be to promote fairness, and try to find an equitable solution. ",977,940
972e8032-a55b-4c9a-a2ed-9913f124d716," Dana's Conveyance The first issue is what kinds of interests were created through Dana's conveyance of Blackacre. Based on the language of the conveyance, which is ambiguous, it seems that Eve has a fee simple subject to executory limitation in either fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) OR fee simple determinable (FSD). This is because both conditional (provided that) and durational (so long as) language was used in the conveyance in relation to the limitation (not to sell the house). This means that Dana either has a right of entry/power of termination if it is FSSCS or the possibility of reverter if it is FSD. Both reversions would be in FSA. Since this is ambiguous, courts will look to the rules of constructions, which favor a FSSCS over an FSD, but it could also be argued under Marenholz that caselaw has at times (when a conveyance is ambigous) decided in favor of an FSD over an FSSCS, particularly if it seems that the intent of the grantor was to convey an FSD. In general the conveyance should be read as a whole and avoid partial intestacy. In addition, after Dana passes away, she conveys her personal property to Fiona, her daughter. Based on the ""laws"" of New Suffolk, it seems that once Dana passes away, Fiona, as her daughter, would ""receive"" or inherit either the possibility of revertor or right of entry, if Eve were to sell the home. Eve's Intent to Solicit Offers/Sell the Property Another issue is whether Eve is able to solicit and potentially sell the property after Dana's death. It seems like a difficult argument to make for Eve, as the conveyance makes it clear that Dana did not want the property to be sold, similar to the conveyance made in the Baker v. Weedon case (conveyance stated that house was not to be sold, yet Anna tried to sell the house to use the profits to live off of). In both situations, the interest holders, Eve here and Anna Plaxico from the Baker v. Weedon case, did not own the property in FSA, which would have given them the ability to do what they wanted with the property (keep it, transfer it, sell it, etc.). As a result, Eve's best argument to sell the land seems to be based on economic waste. She could argue that according to the real estate tax office the property is at an all time high and that by not selling the property, 8 is engaging in economic waste (under the she common law). She could further suppor that claim, by arguing that while Fiona might have an interest in the property, she originally did not want the property when Dana was conveying it, and as a result, her both situations, the interest holders, Eve here and Anna Plaxico from the Baker v. Weedon case, did not own the property in FSA, which would have given them the ability to do what they wanted with the property (keep it, transfer it, sell it, etc.). As a result, Eve's best argument to sell the land seems to be based on economic waste. She could argue that according to the real estate tax office the property is at an all time high and that by not selling the property, she is engaging in economic waste (under the common law). She could further suppor that claim, by arguing that while Fiona might have an interest in the property, she originally did not want the property when Dana was conveying it, and as a result, her interests should not be factored into the equation in the same manner because her interest only resulted as a default due to Dana's death. Eve could also argue that selling the property would be beneficial because it would prevent continued permissive waste. For example, since she moved to Florida she has not taken care of the property. The roof has missing shingles, the glass is cracked, and there are some other serious issues with the property. This is similar to Anna's argument, in that she stated that the property was not being used to its full potential because as an owner she was not longer able to keep up with it. As a result, Eve could argue that in order for the property to be used efficiently/effectively, and to avoid continued permissive waste, it should be sold to someone who will use the property in the way it should be used. Eve could also use policy rationales to further support her argument. For example, by selling the land it will put the land in the hands of someone who would use it effectively because as of now, Eve was not using the property but rather was only paying the property taxes on the land. Fiona's's Counter Argument to the Sale of the Property It seems a strong argument that Fiona could make to counter Eve's sale of the property is that she, as the daughter of Dana, has either the possibility of reverter or power of termination, if Eve were to violate the limitation in the conveyance. That limitation being if Eve sells the property. If she violates it, Fiona will either automatically have possession of Blackacre, or she will have the right of termination (depending on whether the conveyance is in FSSCS or FSD). If she can re-take possession of the land, it would prevent the sale of the property. Furthermore, Fiona could try to counter Eve's argument by stating that the economic value test is not the exclusive test to consider when deciding whether a piece of property should be sold or not. For example, in the Baker v. Weedon case, the court used a ""best interest of the parties"" test where they looked at all the interest of the parties involved, not 8 the current/present possessor in order to just determine whether the property should be sold. Here, Fiona could argue that her interest should be considered as well because she was conveyed Dana's personal property and she is the daughter of the it would prevent the sale of the property. Furthermore, Fiona could try to counter Eve's argument by stating that the economic value test is not the exclusive test to consider when deciding whether a piece of property should be sold or not. For example, in the Baker v. Weedon case, the court used a ""best interest of the parties"" test where they looked at all the interest of the parties involved, not just the current/present possessor in order to determine whether the property should be sold. Here, Fiona could argue that her interest should be considered as well because she was conveyed Dana's personal property and she is the daughter of the grantor, which gives her an interest in Blackacre. In addition, Fiona could argue, similar to the grandchildren in their suit with Anna, that the property has not fallen into complete deterioration, but rather there has been sufficient funds to continue to pay the property taxes. Additionally, Fiona could use the rule/takeaway from Ark Land, where the court considered long-time ownership as well as sentimental/emotional connection to the land in conjunction with the economic value test. For example, in Ark Land the Caudill family's longstanding ownership and sentimental attachment to the property was weighed against Ark Land's economic interest in the land. Here, the court could weigh the fact that Fiona having grown up on the property (sentimental/emotional attachment) and her family having owned the farm since 1980, against the economic/monetary value of the property. A court could decide in favor of Fiona, like they decided in favor of the Caudills, if they find that her sentimental attachment and longstanding family ownership outweighs the monetary gain/value for Eve, who has the present interest in the property. Fiona Holding Eve Accountable for the Repairs If Fiona was able to either automatically re-take the property or terminate Eve's present interest in the property (via right of entry) she could claim that Eve is responsible for making the necessary repairs to the property, as she was previous present possessor of the property. Generally speaking under the common law, a future interest holder should be able to take the property (once it becomes possessory) in the same condition as the previous present possessor had it in (i.e. Fiona should be able to reclaim the land in the same condition as Eve claimed it from Dana). In this case, if Fiona were to receive the property, it would not be in the same state as when Eve received the property from Dana. Fiona could argue that due to the permissive waste (negligence on Eve's part--she let the property fall into disrepair when she moved to Florida), she is responsible for making the appropriate repairs/fixes in order to return the property to its original state. Fiona would need to use the rule/rationale under the common law to support this claim for repairs. "," Peter's Legal Rights/Potential Options The issue in the present case is whether Peter has any legal rights/authority to relieve himself from the remaining rent payments on the commerical property he leased based upon the interference of the landlord (LL). To begin with, Peter's current lease is a tenancy for years (specifically 5 years), therefore he is liable for the rent until the end date of that lease, which is 12/31/2023. A landlord, when leasing out a commercial space must transfer possession (for the specified length) and guarantee that the tenant can enjoy the property without interference from the LL (covenant of quiet enjoyment). There are a few options for Peter given the seemingly long-term interference from the landlord. The options are: (1) actual/partial eviction, as seen in the McEnany case, (2) constructive eviction, as in the Echo Consulting case, and (3) damages. Here, it does not seem that the interference from the LL rises to the level of actual/partial eviction, as was seen in the McEnany case (encroachment of the wall was seen as a partial eviction from the whole property because the basis of the rent is based on enjoyment of the entire property) given that Peter and his employees still had access to the building and parking lot to do their jobs/work, even if it was more difficult for them to get in and our and/or navigate. A strong argument that Peter can bring forth is that the LL breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE) which could lead to constructive eviction. The CQE applies to all leases, including commerical and residential, cannot be waived (either orally or in writing), and involves both latent and patent defects of a property (as seen in the Reste Realty case). The necessary elements to bring a successful claim are: (1) the LL's conduct interfered with the tenant's possession/use of the property, (2) the interference was susbtantial, (3) tenant notified the LL of the issue/conduct, (4) tenant vacates/abandons the property/premises. Here, Peter could argue that the interference was originally only supposed to last a week or so, there is substantial noise, and the blockage of the doors/parking lot are deterring customers and delaying his delivery process. This interference is not only substantial but could be seen as ""permanent"" at least at the present time, as there is no set end date for construction. This is similar to the Reste Realty v. Cooper case, where the flooding, while only occurring when it rained, was seen as permanent because it was bound to occur each time it rained and the flooding significantly interfered susbtantial, (3) tenant notified the LL of the issue/conduct, (4) tenant vacates/abandons the property/premises. Here, Peter could argue that the interference was originally only supposed to last a week or so, there is substantial noise, and the blockage of the doors/parking lot are deterring customers and delaying his delivery process. This interference is not only substantial but could be seen as ""permanent"" at least at the present time, as there is no set end date for construction. This is similar to the Reste Realty v. Cooper case, where the flooding, while only occurring when it rained, was seen as permanent because it was bound to occur each time it rained and the flooding significantly interfered with and often prevented Cooper form conducting her business on a regular basis. Furthermore, similar to Cooper, who continuously notified the the LL of the issue, here, Peter notifies and reached out to the LL on multiple occassions in order to find out when the construction will end. Each time he speaks with her, she tells him it is taking longer than expected and to be patient. The last element that would need to be satisfied if Peter were to move forward with a claim for breach of CQE is actually abandoning/vacating the property, which he has not done yet. The court's recognized this is a drastic measure, especially if the tenant is unsure whether he/she will be held liable for the additional rent payments. Since it seems Peter would like to remain in the building if possible, he could look to alternative means to try to mitigate/deal with the current issue. For example, if he does decide to move out, he could create a separate account where he keeps the rent for the remaining months so that he can prove he had the money to pay for it if it went to court. Additionally, he could try to renegotiate the terms of the agreeement, such as lower the rent per month until the construction is done. Or, similar to what the court discusses in Echo Consulting, he could try to sue for damages. In particular, he could argue that his business has suffered significantly and he has lost profits, and as a result is suing for damages for the period of time the construction took place on the property. Peter could use policy rationales to further support his claims for constructive eviction and/or damages. For example, Peter should be able to claim constructive eviction and/or damages because that is his only right in the unequal realtionship between a LL/tenant (he sits in an inferior bargaining position). In addition, he could assert that as a LL she had the responsibility/duty to provide a property without interference, which she has failed to do. Furthermore, out of fairness, the LL should either move to get the construction done quickly and/or remedy the situation via renegotitating/lowering the rent or paying damages, given the impact on Peter's livlihood. As a result, it seems that Peter has a strong case for constructive eviction and/or damages, depending on whether or not he decides to vacate the premises. If he were to bring forth a successful case, similar to Cooper in the Reste Realty case, he would not be held liable for the remaining rent payments through 12/31/2023. to get the construction done quickly and/or remedy the situation via renegotitating/lowering the rent or paying damages, given the impact on Peter's livlihood. As a result, it seems that Peter has a strong case for constructive eviction and/or damages, depending on whether or not he decides to vacate the premises. If he were to bring forth a successful case, similar to Cooper in the Reste Realty case, he would not be held liable for the remaining rent payments through 12/31/2023. [Note]--Since this is a commerical property, the Implied Warranty of Habitability does not seem relevant nor were there any siginficant health code/safety violations addressed in the current case. Linda's Arguments Linda has a few arguments that she could assert in order to ensure that Peter remains liable for the rent. First, she could argue based on the contract/lease that Peter is liable until the end of the 5-year period because it is a tenancy of years with a fixed end date. Secondly, she could argue that the construction did not rise to the level of constructive eviction, similar to the decision in the Echo Consulting case. In that case, the business tried to argue that there was constructive eviction because they could no longer use the main entrance the parking lot was difficult to access, but the court ultimately decided that it was not constructive eviction because while they could not use the ""main entrance"" they still had access to an entrance to the building as well as the parking lot. Here, Peter and his employees could still use both entrances and parking lots, even if they were more difficult navigate. Furthermore, Linda could also use the analysis in the Echo case to support her defense by stating that the lease should be read as a contract and in plain language. Per the language in the lease, they had a ""common right of access"" and a ""Common use of the parking lot"" which they still had a right to, even if that use/access was a little more difficult. Again, this is similar language to the lease agreement in the Echo case where the the lease outlined ""common access"" not a specific door/entrance. Lastly, Linda could try to argue that while the construction has taken longer than she had anticipated, she has taken reasonable steps to ensure that it is done as quickly as possible and has been sympathetic to the challenges it has posed for Peter. For example, she reduced his rent by $100 because she knew that the construction was a hassle for Peter. If Linda fears that Peter might abandoned the premises she could try to renegotiate a lower rent for the remainder of the time the construction is taking place, rather than ultimately having him move out and having to re-let the space to a new tenant (similar to mitigating damages, as in Sommer v. Kridel, but prior to the tenant actually vacating the premises).

In conclusion, Linda could dispute that there was constructive eviction because Peter and his employees still had access to the building, which meant they could continue to do their jobs/work in the pizza shop. She could support her defense by asserting that she has been sympathetic to Peter by reducing his rent payment, and could consider doing so until the construction is completed. ",1486,1652
59b166d8-5cbd-4c4e-a3aa-1ab36759dc42," When a conveyance is ambiguous the rules of construction come into play. looking to the intent of the grantor, favoring interests in Fee Simple Absolute, avoiding partial intestacy, favoring free alienability, FSSCS favored over FSD (with exceptions), vested over contingent remainders, and looking at the document as a whole, aiming for consistency. These guidlines provide the opportunity for clarity and allow parties to make cogent arguments based in policy as oposed to relying on how a conveyance is written. The phrase ""so long as"" in Dana's conveyance lends itself to a reading that Eve owns Blackacre in FSD, in that the language is durational in nature. However, the prior phrase ""provided that"" is much more conditional in nature and lends itself to a reading that Eve's interestes are in FSSCS, the preferred interest. If the courts were to ignore the fact that conveying land to someone with the condition that they don't sell it is poor polilcy, and therefore not allowing Eve to simply own Blackacre in FSA, given that Dana passed on her personal property to Fiona, it could be argued that Fiona has a right of re-entry, avoiding partial intestacy by making her the grantor. Fiona could argue that Eve's desire for other bids meets the ""attempts to sell the house"" condition, and could take back, or re-enter, Blackacre. In addition, looking to intent of the grantor, Dana wanted Blackacre to stay in the family, Fiona's re-entry and subsequent ownership in FSA would fulfill that wish. Regarding the state of the home, even if Eve had Blackacre in FSSCS or FSD she was undoubtedly repsonsible for it's upkeep, which she acknowledged in some way by paying the realestate taxes. Allowing the land to fall into disrepair could be considered a type of permissive waste, which policy not only discourages but could lend itself to a further interpretation that the land should belong to Fiona after all. On the otherhand, Eve could argue that given the oddly worded conveyance and the overally constricting nature of the condition therein, she should be rewarded the land in FSA, to do with as she pleases. If this were the case, Fiona would have no argument regarding whether or not the land was sold or how it was treated. Eve paid her taxes and if she would like to sell it she should have the right to do so. On the otherhand, Eve could argue that given the oddly worded conveyance and the overally constricting nature of the condition therein, she should be rewarded the land in FSA, to do with as she pleases. If this were the case, Fiona would have no argument regarding whether or not the land was sold or how it was treated. Eve paid her taxes and if she would like to sell it she should have the right to do so. "," The Covenant of quiet enjoyment ensures that a tenant has the right to use and access, as it's intended, all the land he's been given the rights to without interference from the landlord. Any significant breach of this covenant is tantamount to constructive eviction. This reasoning can be applied to businesses as well. If the landlord interferes in such a way as to signifcatly impede a tenants right to run their business there is undoubtedlty a breach occuring. An argument could be made that, given the drop in customers, profits, and ability to make on-time deliveries the ongoing construction is constructively evicting the pizza shop. Their deliveries are made through the now mostly blocked back door, deliveries which require someone to navigate a pizza box through a maze of scaffolding, which is adding to their delivery turn around time. The only parking lot the pizza shop has use of is the one in the back, and it is where customers park, making the scaffold laden rear-entrance the main means of access to the shop.The continuing construction month after month has not only made it nigh impossible for the employees to navigate the space, but the customers can hardly be expected to know to park their cars in the back, and either navigate around the construction, or walk around the building and use the entrance on the otherside. It is clear the ongoing construction is undoubtedly interfering with business. While and argument could be made that these hurdles are merely inconveniences, the wagon case tells us that even a partial actual eviction is still an eviction. The fact that the construction equipment is encroaching on a piece of property Peter has leased is wholly unacceptable, especially if Linda has been made aware of it every single week. Peter is not paying nearly $2,000 a month for a part of a parking space and a mostly blocked rear-entrance. He has given Linda ample time to address these issues, and, if he wants to, a strong argument could be made he could give notice and leave, arguing both his actual and constructive eviction negates any further monetary responsibility. On the otherhand, much like in the Echo bank case, there are other factors to consider. Linda could argue not only is there a whole other entrance to the building the shop has access to that is not encased made aware of it every single week. Peter is not paying nearly $2,000 a month for a part of a parking space and a mostly blocked rear-entrance. He has given Linda ample time to address these issues, and, if he wants to, a strong argument could be made he could give notice and leave, arguing both his actual and constructive eviction negates any further monetary responsibility. On the otherhand, much like in the Echo bank case, there are other factors to consider. Linda could argue not only is there a whole other entrance to the building the shop has access to that is not encased in scaffolding, but that all the areas mentioned in the lease are still accessible to the public and the shop's employees.The doors are not locked and the common parking spaces are not blocked. Peter may have to close the windows but his 2000 square feet of floor space is not being infringed upon in anyway. Nothing is stopping his employees from taking deliveries through the front door instead of the rear except convenience. As far as the parking space is concerned, a tight fit or otherwise, Peter has his own parking space. What minor encroachment may be occuring is undoubtedly taken care of by the deduction of $100 from Peter's monthly rent, much like the Staircase case where the adverse posessors simply paid for their minor encroachment.

165f436c-ce5e-4cf6-8005-5c96b0801ab8," QUESTION ONE The conveyance written by Dana is ambgious because it contains both durational and conditional lanuage. However, it will still be read to pass Blackacre to Eve in Fee Simple Absolute because the statutory language in New Suffolk maintains that when writing a grant, the grantor shall be determined to pass the entirety of their interest to the grantee rather than less than their full interest. This is consistent with both the Rules of Conveyance that favor ambigious conveyances to favor Fee Simple Absolute because it protects the free alienability of property and the White v. Brown court that determined an ambigious conveyance, even though itcontainted a situplation that the house must not be sold, to be passing the property in FSA because the grantor did not expressly stipulate otherwise. Because of the statutory language in New Suffolk and the rules of construction that favor FSA to protect the free alienability of property, and the White v. Brown ruling, the conveyance in Dana, though ambigious with a condtion, since she did not EXPRESSLY STATE OTHERWISE will be read to have conveyed the property to Eve in Fee Simple Absolute. Since Eve can argue that she has been conveyed the property in Fee Simple Absolute, she is free to solicit any offers she has for Blackacre since she owns the property in a state where she can freely transfer it. This is further supported by the fact that ""the property has clearly appreciated in value"" due to the houses's prime location and selling the property now would be maximizing its value which is something courts consider. Fiona could have a basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre if she argues that Eve has been conveyed the property in something less than Fee Simple Absolute. The conveyance does contain both durational and conditional lanugage, and Fiona can argue that this conveyed the property to Eve in either a Fee Simple Determinable or a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent, which would give the grantor either a right to reversion or re-entry. In this case, according to the rules of construction, a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent would be favored because due to the re-entry clause, it keeps the property in the hands of the people who want it most and will therefore use it in the most effective way. Fiona could argue that when Dana passed and left all of her property to Fiona, this included Blackacre and the Right to Re Entry that would be triggered by Eve attempting to or selling the durational and conditional lanugage, and Fiona can argue that this conveyed the property to Eve in either a Fee Simple Determinable or a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent, which would give the grantor either a right to reversion or re-entry. In this case, according to the rules of construction, a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent would be favored because due to the re-entry clause, it keeps the property in the hands of the people who want it most and will therefore use it in the most effective way. Fiona could argue that when Dana passed and left all of her property to Fiona, this included Blackacre and the Right to Re Entry that would be triggered by Eve attempting to or selling the property. However, Eve has only recieved one phone call from a real estate developer and has not attempted to or sold the propertry so the condition would not be broken that would allow Fiona to Re- Enter the property. Fiona could also have a basis for holding Eve accountable for repairs if she argues that Eve has been the conveyed a Life Estate by Dana. Though the conveyance is ambigious, it is similar to the White v. Brown conveyance where the old lady conveyed the property stipulating that her house is not to be sold. Even though the court held for a Fee Simple Absolute, the dissent argued that the language of the conveyance clearly conveyed the intent of the Grantor to make a ""gift"" rather than the full conveyance. The intent of the grantor is another rule of construction, since grants should be read to relfect what the Grantor wante dthe property to do. If Fiona argues that Eve has been conveyed a Life Estate, that means that Dana would have retained a reversion once Eve died. Fiona could argue that she now has this reversion once Dana passed, and that Life Tenants have a duty not to commit waste on the property because it damages the value and condition for future interest holders. Eve has committed permissive waste on Blackacre. Permissive waste is when a current holder of the estate acts negligently towrads this property and this negligence decreases the value of the property somehow. By moving to Florida and and letting the house sit int he cold New Suffolk weather, Blackacre is left with ""roof shingles missing, the glass cracked glass and other serious problems"". Eve, by moving to Florida and neglecting Blackacre for nearly 5 years has actively committed permissive waste and the court finds this punisible because it has actively decreased the value of the property for any future interest holder (i.e Fiona). Fiona, since Eve has created permissive waste on the property, can sue Eve for damages or force her repair Blackacre to its original state since she holds a future interest in a reversion in Fee Simple Absolute. CONCLUSION However, given the statutory lanugage in New Suffolk and the fact that the rules of construction and the White v. Brown court are adamiate about reading ambigious conveyances to have conveyed the property to the grantee in Fee Simple Absolute because it protects the free alienability of property, a court would most likely hold that the conveyance that Dana created conveyed Blackacre to Eve in a Fee Absolute. CONCLUSION However, given the statutory lanugage in New Suffolk and the fact that the rules of construction and the White v. Brown court are adamiate about reading ambigious conveyances to have conveyed the property to the grantee in Fee Simple Absolute because it protects the free alienability of property, a court would most likely hold that the conveyance that Dana created conveyed Blackacre to Eve in a Fee Simple Absolute because Dana did not EXPRESSLY STATE OTHERWISE IN THE CONVEYANCE. This would allow Eve to freely sell the property to anyone who may be interested in it. She would therefore not have any issues soliciting futher offers for the property. "," Peter has a term of years lease with Linda and is liable for paying rent until the end of the five years because of this. However, Peter can claim that Linda has breached his Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment. The Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment is a tenant's right to enjoy thier property, and if breached, can result in an actual, partial or constructive eviction in which the tenant would not be responsible for paying rent. Peter would not have been actually evicted becuase he was not physically barred from his whole premises. Peter could potentially argue that he has been partially evicted because the construction equipment encroaches a little on his designated parking spot and the Smith Court held that an eviction from part of your property constitutes an eviction from the whole of your property and this would allow Peter to withhold rent because the reason for going the debt of rent is to to be able to use every part of your property and you pay the whole rent on every part of your property and his property includes the parking space. However, it is a EXTREMLY miminal encorachment and he can still park in his spot, and Linda has already apportioned his rent to be $100 less monthly which is another solution the Smith court cites in terms of partial eviction. Although his access to the back door is slightly blocked, Peter's lease stipulates that he only has ""common access"" to the floor area. This is similar to the Echo case where the court held that since no where in the lease did it EXPRESSLY stipulate that the tenant had access to a specific door, and that the tenant was afforded only common access, that the tenant could not claim that thier rights were encroached on because construction barred them access to one of the doors. Although the Pizza shop liked to used the back door, Peter has no express property right to it. Peter would most likely not be able to withhold rent due to a partial eviction. court cites in terms of partial eviction. Although his access to the back door is slightly blocked, Peter's lease stipulates that he only has ""common access"" to the floor area. This is similar to the Echo case where the court held that since no where in the lease did it EXPRESSLY stipulate that the tenant had access to a specific door, and that the tenant was afforded only common access, that the tenant could not claim that thier rights were encroached on because construction barred them access to one of the doors. Although the Pizza shop liked to used the back door, Peter has no express property right to it. Peter would most likely not be able to withhold rent due to a partial eviction. Peter could get out of paying the rent for the rest of his five-year lease if he claims that he was constructively evicted, but this would be slightly risky. In order to be constructively evicted the issue that the tenant is having must be so substantial it is as if the tenat is being actually evicted and it must be continous, the tenant then must inform the landlord of the issue, give the landlord a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue, and if they have not fixed the issue in a reasonable amount of time, the tenant must LEAVE THE PREMISES in a reasonable amount of time. So, in order to not pay rent for the rest of his five year lease based on a constructive eviction, Peter must take the risk of leaving his apartment and leaving his fate in the hands of the court to decide if the issues that he are citing are substantial and continous nough to be ""as if"" he was partially evicted and if he gave Linda a reasonable amount of time to repair the issues and if he left in a reasonable amount of time. He has informed Linda of the Issues and it has been going on for months. However, although the construction is annoying since the delivery boys cannot use the back door and it is noisy, and he has to close his windows because of the dust and he has slightly lost customers and revenue, the conditions that Peter has to deal with because of the construction do not measure up to the conditions in the Reste Realty case that the court held were substantial enough to consitute a constructive eviction. The construction that Peter is dealing with has a natural end, and the court in Reste mainly held that the tenant was constructively evicted because her office space flooded EVERY TIME it rained. The construction is an annoyance, and has been going on for months, but it is not continous and substantial like the constant flooding that the Reste tenant experienced that gave rise to her being able to withhold rent due to a contsructive eviction. Peter would likely be taking a big risk by leaving his lease before its natural end and banking on not having to pay the rent for the rest of his lease on the basis of a court determining that the issues of the construction that he is subject to are so bad that it is as if he has been constructively evicted. Even though Peter would most likely not be able to leave before the end of his lease and not have to pay rent based on a breach of his Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment due to an actual, partial or constructive eviction, he would be able to recover damages from Linda. In Echo, the court broaded the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment to allow a tenant to recover damages if the issues they are subjected to are not enough to consitute an actual, partial or constructive eviction but still sigificant enough to be a breach of their rent for the rest of his lease on the basis of a court determining that the issues of the construction that he is subject to are so bad that it is as if he has been constructively evicted. Even though Peter would most likely not be able to leave before the end of his lease and not have to pay rent based on a breach of his Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment due to an actual, partial or constructive eviction, he would be able to recover damages from Linda. In Echo, the court broaded the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment to allow a tenant to recover damages if the issues they are subjected to are not enough to consitute an actual, partial or constructive eviction but still sigificant enough to be a breach of their CQE. The court reasoned that a tenant should not have to wait until their situation gets SO BAD that they are actually, partially or constructively evicted to hold their landlord liable for disruppting their right to quietly enjoy thier property. In this case, although the annoyance of the construction would likely not be enough to constitute an actual, partial or constructive eviction, the fact that he has been dealing with these issues for months and has lost revenue because of it and has had to deal with the inconvience of only using one of the two entrances would likely be grounds for Peter to recover damages from Linda based on a breach of his CQE. These conditions are similar to the conditions the tenant experienced in Echo with the resitricted access to one door and construction noise, and the court held that these conditions were enough for the tenant to recover damages. Since modern day landlord/tenant relationships are thought to be contractual in nature, when a party breaches, the other party is entitled to damages based on this breach. Peter, given the annoyance of the construction, the loss of revene, the restriction of access to only one door and the minor encroachment onto his parking space would likely be able to sue Linda for damages based on a breach of his CQE even though he was not actually, partially and constructively evicted. CONCLUSION Peter would most likely not be able to withhold rent and move out of his lease before its natural end because he was not actually or partially evicted. Peter would be taking a significant chance in leaving the propety before his lease ends and banking on a court deciding that he is not liable to pay rent to Linda because the conditions he was subjected to made it AS IF he was actually evicted. They simply are not substnatial enough to rise to this level, nor are they continous since, although it takes months, construction has a NATURAL end which distinguishes them from the Reste case with the constant rain. However, I would say, given the situation, that Peter has a good chance of recovering damages from Linda based on a breach of his CQE because although the conditions did not rise to an actual, partial or constructive eviction, they still substantially interferred with his ability to quietly enjoy his property. are not substnatial enough to rise to this level, nor are they continous since, although it takes months, construction has a NATURAL end which distinguishes them from the Reste case with the constant rain.

e72e27bd-ca07-4cf9-80d5-079b1a678d61," MY EXAM NUMBER IS . NOT SURE WHY BUT AT THE TOP OF MY EXAM IT STILL HAS MY FIRST EXAM NUMBER FROM MIDTERMS (3747640). Parties Interests in Blackacre The first issue is what the interests of the parties are as a result of Dana's conveyance that is ambiguous because there is both conditional and durational language surrounding Dana's condition that the house not be sold. The language, ""provided that"", suggests that Eve would have a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, while the ""only so long as"" language is durational and leans more towards it being a fee simple determinable. The practical implication of this distinction is whether Eve's possessory interest in the property would terminate automatically if the condition is broken, because it would be automatically if she has a FSD rather than a FSSCS. When there is an ambiguous conveyance at issue, the courts will often folllow the rules of construction regarding ambiguous conveyances. The rules of construction favor FSSCS over FSD because it does not result in the automatic transfer/forfeiture of property when the condition/limitation is broken, but rather requires that the grantor/future interest holder physically retake the property from the present possessory interest holder. Based on this rule of construction, this conveyance should be interpreted to convey a FSSCS to Eve, rather than a FSD. However, as we saw in the Mahrenholz case, this is not always the result, because the court there held there that an ambiguous conveyance was an FSD rather than a FSSCS. However, in that conveyance, there was more language suggesting that the interest was an FSD in regards to the limitation automatically triggering the future interest. Here, however, there is no further information in the conveyance about what happens when the condition/limitation is violated. Another rule of construction is to look at the grantor's intent in their conveyance. Here, Dana knew that Fiona had no interest in returning to the property. As such, it could be argued that her intent was to create an FSSCS rather than a FSD because the property would not automatically revert to Fiona if the condition was broken. Ultimately, the court will likely find that this conveyance gave Eve an FSSCS rather than an FSD. The Next issue is Fiona's interest in the property. Because the court will find that Eve had a FSSCS, the property will revert (not automatically, it must be physically retaken through the right of entry) to the grantor's estate in the event the condition is broken. As Dana's only daughter, the property would be returning to the property. As such, it could be argued that her intent was to create an FSSCS rather than a FSD because the property would not automatically revert to Fiona if the condition was broken. Ultimately, the court will likely find that this conveyance gave Eve an FSSCS rather than an FSD. The Next issue is Fiona's interest in the property. Because the court will find that Eve had a FSSCS, the property will revert (not automatically, it must be physically retaken through the right of entry) to the grantor's estate in the event the condition is broken. As Dana's only daughter, the property would be granted to Fiona as Dana's issue because Dana did not specify otherwise what would happen to the property if Eve broke the condition and attempted to sell the house. However, because it is a FSSCS and not a FSD, this future interest is not automatically triggered to become possessory, Fiona must actually re-take possession of the property in order to claim it. As a result, Fiona has a right of enty/power of termination future interest in Blackacre. Arguments for Eve to Solicit Offers The next issue is whether Eve will be permitted to solicit offers to sell the property. One argument Eve could make to support her being able to solicit offers is based on the concept of economic waste, because she could say that not selling the property would be failing to use the property to its full economic capacity since it has appreciated in value. Additionally, while the court may look to the grantor's intent not to have the house be sold, they will find that Dana's conveyance creates a restriction on the alienability of the property in saying that it is not to be sold. As we saw in White v. Brown and in the rules of construction, the courts do not favor restrictions on alienability such as the ability for an interest holder to transfer the property, and Eve could argue that she should be allowed to solicit offers so as not to limit her alienability. However, as we saw in Baker v. Weedon, the court will look to the best interest of all the parties involved when considering whether to allow the sale of property (present and future interest holders), not just the present interest holder. Here, while it could be argued that selling the property would benefit Eve because she will gain a profit from the sale, the sale could harm Fiona as a future interest holder who now has a sentimental attachment to the land as she grew up living there and wants to live there again. Additionally, Fiona could argue that Eve has been able to pay the taxes on the land, just like the plaintiff in Baker v Weedon who wanted to sell the land. The court may, as they did in Baker v Weedon, hold that the parties should work it out themselves such as selling part of the land for Eve to get the proceeds from while Fiona could keep the part of the land the home is on in order to serve her interests of living in the home she grew up in with her mother. Fiona The last set of issues revolve around Fiona's basis for reclaiming the property. The first issue is whether taxes on the land, just like the plaintiff in Baker v Weedon who wanted to sell the land. The court may, as they did in Baker v Weedon, hold that the parties should work it out themselves such as selling part the land for Eve to get the proceeds from while Fiona could keep the part of the land the home is on in order to serve her interests of living in the home she grew up in with her mother. Fiona The last set of issues revolve around Fiona's basis for reclaiming the property. The first issue is whether or not Eve has violated the condition in the conveyance that she is not to attempt to sell the house. If the condition has been violated, Fiona can take an action to reclaim the property as a future interest holder from the grantor's estate with a right of entry following Eve's FSSCS. The conveyance says that Eve cannot attempt to sell the house. Here, the court will not find the condition has been broken because the real estate developer called Eve to make an offer (rather than Eve making the call or inquiring about the sale of the house) and Eve has not acted in furtherance of selling the home, as the facts state that she is only curious about selling. However, she must be aware that if she does attempt to sell the home, a court may find that she has violated the condition and Fiona can act to reclaim the property. However, Fiona could argue she has a claim to retake the property and for holding Eve accountable for the repairs needed based on the doctrine of waste even if Eve has not violated the condition in the conveyance. Waste is a doctrine that acts to protect future interest holders of a property from the actions (or negligence) of the present interest holder of a property. The rationale for the doctrine of waste is that the future interest holders should not suffer at the hands of the present possessory interest holders by their actions or inactions that change the value of the land. Fiona could argue that Eve has engaged in permissive waste (not maintaining the property, being negligent) by moving away and allowing the property to fall into disrepair with the shingles missing, glass cracked, and other serious problems. As a result, if the court finds that Eve has engaged in permissive waste to a substantial extent, Fiona could sue for damages (to pay for the repairs needed) or even to have Eve be forced to forfeit the property to Fiona if it is serious enough. However, Eve could make a counterargument that she has not engaged in waste that would allow for such consequences because the property appreciated in value, not decreased, as stated in the facts. The concept of waste, as was seen in Woodrick v. Wood, is to only prevent the current interest holder from doing something when it causes the property to decrease in value, not increase. But again, as mentioned in Baker v. Weedon, the court will look to the best interest of all the parties involved and will consider the sentimental value (as did the court in Arkland) the property has to fiona, that fact that eve has let the 4property come into disrepair, but also Eve's interest in getting a profit from the sale of the land. not decreased, as stated in the facts.

"," The first issue to address in terms of Peter's options is whether the landlord (Linda) has breached the lease. Because this is a commercial lease, the only relevant implied covenant is the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in all leases that states that the landlord (or one with paramount title) cannot interfere with the tenant's use and enjoyment of the leased premises, otherwise the tenant may be able to terminate the lease or withhold rent.The policy rationale for the covenant of quiet enjoyment allowing relief for the tenant is that the landlord's obligations and the tenant's requirement to pay rent are dependent covenants, and that if the landlord breaches their obligations, the tenant is not required to perform theirs. There are three potential claims that Peter could try to make if he argues that Linda has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The first potential argument Peter could attempt to make is that Linda partially evicted him through the encroachment on his designated parking spot by the construction equipment. A partial actual eviction occurs when the landlord's actions result in a physical dispossession of a portion of the leased premises. Peter could argue that the construction equipment should be considered a partial actual eviction because Linda's action of hiring the contractor to make repairs results in the construction equipment encroaching on his parking spot. Peter could also attempt to argue that he was partially evicted because the scaffolding largely blocks access to the rear door from customer use and making the pizza deliveries. As we saw in the brick wall case, a partial actual eviction can result in an abatement of the entire rent for the period during which this dispossession happens, based on the rationale that the use and enjoyment of the entire property is the basis for the entire rent and that this cannot be apportioned. However, there are some weaknesses to this argument for partial actual eviction that Linda could make. First, Linda could argue that Peter is still able to use his parking spot despite the fact that the equipment encroaches a little onto his spot and thus this encroachment doesn't truly dispossess him of use of the property. Second, the facts never specifically state that Linda allowed this encroachment, compared to the landlord in the brick wall case who specifically allowed the person to build the brick wall onto the apportioned. However, there are some weaknesses to this argument for partial actual eviction that Linda could make. First, Linda could argue that Peter is still able to use his parking spot despite the fact that the equipment encroaches a little onto his spot and thus this encroachment doesn't truly dispossess him of use of the property. Second, the facts never specifically state that Linda allowed this encroachment, compared to the landlord in the brick wall case who specifically allowed the person to build the brick wall onto the tenant's property. It's not even clear that Linda is aware of the parking spot encroachment, as the facts only mention Peter expressing concerns about the repairs. However, even if the court were to find there was a partial actual eviction, Linda would argue that only a portion of the rent (equivalent to the proportion of the encroachment by the equipment of the entire property) should be abated based on a rationale of fairness and the minority view in the Restatement. In regards to the rear door, as we saw in the Echo case, having ""common right of access"" to the door means that Peter's business can use the door, but if it is blocked off it will not result in a partial actual eviction because there are still other ways to enter the premises and it is not exclusively theirs to use. The second claim that Peter could attempt to make based on a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is that he was constructively evicted because Linda's authorization of the construction that results in the noise, dust, and difficulty in using the rear door for customers and deliveries makes it ""as if"" he was evicted. There are four elements to constructive eviction: that the landlord interfered with the tenant's use/possession of the property, that the interference was substantial, that the landlord was notified of the interference, and that the tenant vacated within a reasonable time. Peter's strongest argument to make is that the construction Linda has authorized has substantially interfered with his pizza business. The facts state that it is difficult for customers to enter the rear door, it is difficult to use the rear door for deliveries and to get a delivery car up to it, and difficult to walk through the scaffolding with the pizzas. In fact, Peter notices that he has fewer customers, that the staff is having trouble making their deliveries on time, and that his revenues are down. Peter meets the element of notifying the landlord, as it states he has complained to Linda several times about his concerns with the construction. However, Peter does not currently meet the element of vacating the premises within a reasonable time because he has not left the premises. The policy rationale for allowing constructive eviction is that there is a knowledge and power imbalance between the landlord and tenant, even in a commercial setting as we saw in Reste Realty case. Linda could make arguments that highlight the weaknesses of Peter's constructive eviction claim. First and foremost, months have passed since the construction began and Linda could argue that Peter has not vacated the premises in a reasonable time, even if he were to leave now. If the interference was truly However, Peter does not currently meet the element of vacating the premises within a reasonable time because he has not left the premises. The policy rationale for allowing constructive eviction is that there is a knowledge and power imbalance between the landlord and tenant, even in a commercial setting as we saw in Reste Realty case. Linda could make arguments that highlight the weaknesses of Peter's constructive eviction claim. First and foremost, months have passed since the construction began and Linda could argue that Peter has not vacated the premises in a reasonable time, even if he were to leave now. If the interference was truly as substantial to be ""as if he were evicted"", then Linda will argue that he would have left already. This interference (the noise, dust, difficulty accessing the rear door of pizza shop) seems more analogous to that of the noise and construction in the Echo case in which the court held that it was not substantial enough to be a constructive eviction, rather than the recurring flooding in the Reste Realty case that the court held was substantial enough of an interference by the landlord in order to find that the tenant had been constructively evicted. Additionally, Linda could argue that the problems with Peter's pizza business were not a result of her actions in authorizing the construction, but rather were a result of Peter's own actions in deciding to close the pizza shop for a week. Arguably, the shop could have lost customers as a result of being closed for a week. Constructive eviction cannot be claimed for interferences that are not of the landlord's doing. In terms of the argument that Linda is taking an unreasonable amount of time to address Peter's concerns, she could argue that her taking $ f of the monthly rent and explanations of why there are delays demonstrates that she has recognized the issues (not ignoring them) and is working to resolve them. Finally, the third claim Peter could attempt to make is that even if the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is not substantial enough to constitute a constructive eviction, he should be awarded damages as we saw in the Echo case. The Echo case expanded the CQE to allow the tenant to receive damages even if there has not been a constructive eviction because of the rationale that tenants should not have to wait for things to be so bad that they are actually or constructively evicted in order to get relief for their issues caused by the landlord's actions or inactions that have resulted in an interference with their use and enjoyment in the property. Additionally, this option recognizes the difficulties associated with vacating a property, and allows for the tenant to receive compensation in situations where the either didn't or couldn't vacate. Peter may argue that his damages should equal to the decrease in revenues because he will argue that they were caused by the construction's blocking the rear door making it difficult for customers to enter and for deliveries to be made. Linda's argument against the damages claim will also 8 that the interference with Peter's pizza business be was caused by his own actions of closing the shop for a week rather than caused by her authorization of the construction. As a result, Linda will argue that there was no breach of the convenant of quiet associated with vacating a property, and allows for the tenant to receive compensation in situations where the either didn't or couldn't vacate. Peter may argue that his damages should equal to the decrease in revenues because he will argue that they were caused by the construction's blocking the rear door making it difficult for customers to enter and for deliveries to be made. Linda's argument against the damages claim will also be that the interference with Peter's pizza business was caused by his own actions of closing the shop for a week rather than caused by her authorization of the construction. As a result, Linda will argue that there was no breach of the convenant of quiet enjoyment at all because it only covers interferences by the landlord, not the tenant himself or third parties. If Peter is awarded damages, she will likely argue that it should not be as high as all the lost revenue as a result of that because he closed the shop and that he should receive less. If I were to give Peter advice, I would tell him that the only hope he has of a successful constructive eviction claim would be if he vacated the premises. However, given the weaknesses of his constructive eviction claim (the fact that the court may not find the interference substantial enough as they did in the Echo case), I would advise Peter that he should instead make a claim for damages for a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. I would also encourage him to be able to demonstrate that the interference with his business was not a result of his closing the store for a week when he went on vacation, to show that it was in fact the landlord's actions that caused it in order to make a succesful CQE breach claim. Perhaps he has evidence of other times he has went on vacation/closed the store and could show that it did not have that much of an effect on his subsequent revenues/business and that rather it was the result of the customers barely being able to access the pizza place and the difficulty making deliveries that caused it.

79fc7532-8d8e-4995-adbc-23e3aa4c75af," Interests created by Dana's conveyance? At the time of the conveyance Dana is the grantor conveying blackacre to Eve due to the language ""so long as"" it is possible that this is a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD) due to the langage but Dana also used the words "" provided that"" which can be used to indicate a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS). Either way as the grantor, Dana retains an interest, under FSD Dana has the possibility of Reversion, meaning it will go back to Dana in the event that Eve attempts to sell the home. Under FSSCS Dana retains the right of entry or power of termination, she had the right to retain the and terminate Eve's interest if the condition is to not attempt to sell the home is breached. Due to the wording it is possible that Eve has either a FSD or a FSSCS. Since the grantor conveyed blackacre to Eve using the language ""so long as"" it is possible that this is a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD) due to the langage but Dana also used the words "" provided that"" which can be used to indicate a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS). As seen in the book courts tend to traditionally favor FSD and so if following the majority she would have the interest in FSD which would be similar to the case we saw where the langauge was not clear. However, if the courts look towards the interest of the original owner, Dana as the grantor, had the intent in her conveyance to keep the home in the family. That is the reason for the wording in the first place. If following Dana's intent it is possible to see this as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Fiona is not mentioned in the conveyance and so at this time she does not have any interests. However, after Dana died she was left all of Dana's personal property and so there is possibility that upon Dana's death she became the new grantor and thus is given the right of entry and power of termination. Are there any arguments that Eve could make that she should be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of blackacre? Eve could attempt to make arguments but they would be very weak. She does not hold the estate in Fee Simple Absolute (FSA) because her interest is a FSD if following the majority view and based on a condition that she would lose interest in her attempt to sell. She cannot make an adverse possession termination. Are there any arguments that Eve could make that she should be permitted to solicit other PROPERTY_102­1A_Murthy_FL fers for the sale of blackacre? Eve could attempt to make arguments but they would be very weak. She does not hold the estate in Fee Simple Absolute (FSA) because her interest is a FSD if following the majority view and based on a condition that she would lose interest in her attempt to sell. She cannot make an adverse possession claim because she was conveyed the estate through a legal document and therefore it would not satisfy the element of hostility needed for such a claim. Does Fiona have any basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre and/or holding Eve accountable for the repairs needed on Blackacre? Fiona has a strong argument for a right of entry and power of termination upon Eve's attempt of soliciting the home for offers. As the daughter of the orginal grantor she was left all of Dana's personal property so she is the new grantor. Even if the court were to see this as a FSSCS Fiona would still retain interest in the form of a reversion. Although Dana's has confusing wording she does make her intent clear, that she did not want the home to leave the family. As seen in the case we looked at the court can look to the language but if the language is unclear, the court can reason based on the orginial intent of the grantor at the time of conveyance. For that reason it is very possible that Fiona can reclaim ownership of the property. Once reclaimed Fiona would hold Blackacre in FSA just like her mother. Whether she can hold Eve accountable for the repairs needed on blackacre is a possibility. If the grantor notices that the property is not taken care of if there is waste that reaches more than the average wear and tear then Fiona can also use that as a reason for retaining entry or termination because of the underlying interest of maintaing a property. She can try for damanges in terms of restitution to basically just fix what needs and so it is equal again. However, their is a weakness in that argument because although Eve did not have a FSA she still had an interest and the conveyance made no indication of maintain the property.

However, under the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment as a tenant he is entitled to the use of property provided to him by the landlord under the lease agreement, for the covenant to be breached the landlord has to have interfered with his actual use of the property, and he has to show that it is a substantial interference which effects his enjoyment and proper use of the property. According to the lease he is entitled to "" 2000 sq feet of floor area, common right of access to the common use of the parking lot, and one designated parking spot."" Peter can claim that there is a breach of CQE because he has had to deal with a continuous noise as well as the dust from the contruction that comes in through the window. Therefore the construction has interfered with the property he was given access to with in the lease. Durration of the interference has been long. He was originially told that the construction would be only for a week or so he had the belief that it would done and he could enjoy his property fairly but it has gone on for months. Peter has communicated with the landlord. He has been vocal in his issues and has reported to the landlord weekly of his issues and how he can show the correlation that his business has decreased since the construction started. Interference with accessing his business. The issue of the rear door, technically there is no mention of either doors or entrance ways in the lease agreement. However, the common parking lot provides access to the rear door that was used by his customers who parked in the lot to enter and by his staff in making deliveries. The phsyical structure of the scaffolding from the cunstruction, which doesn't completely block the entrence, still interferes with his business. His staff find it difficult when loading the cars for deliveries, the area is difficult to navigate through for them with all the boxes and not many customers will use the entrance. Then there is the encroachment on his parking spot which he has a right to due to the lease agreement that specifically grants him the spot. This case is similar to the Hilder case, in that case, the tenant was renting property under a term of years as well, that was subject to flooding when it4rained. In this case she let the landlord know of the issue repeatedly and ended up abandoning the property with two years left. She claimed not to have to pay the remaining rent because she was constructively evicted. Applying the same court's rationale it is cars for deliveries, the area is difficult to navigate through for them with all the boxes and not many customers will use the entrance. Then there is the encroachment on his parking spot which he has a right to due to the lease agreement that specifically grants him the spot. This case is similar to the Hilder case, in that case, the tenant was renting property under a term of years as well, that was subject to flooding when it rained. In this case she let the landlord know of the issue repeatedly and ended up abandoning the property with two years left. She claimed not to have to pay the remaining rent because she was constructively evicted. Applying the same court's rationale it is possible that Peter has enough to show a constructive eviction due to the breach of Convenant of Quiet Enjoyment. Since there is an interference from the landlord, it is continous. However, for a Constructive Eviction (CE) he would need to abandoned the property. Because for a Constructive Eviction the interference needs to be substantial enough to cause the tenant to abandon the property. Weakness Peter does have weaknesses to his claims. As a landlord, Linda does have a right to the amount of rent specified in the lease agreement for the durration of the lease. Peter renewed for an additional 5 years and so his lease type is a term of years. Linda could attack his claims of Breach of CQE and his his claim of CE. The interference is not permenant, Linda could also raise that the construction will not be continous and so the interference will eventually end. There is more than one entrance, she could argue that he has access to more than one entrance which was something that was also aruged in the Hilder case becase the tenant in that case had two entrances as well. The wording of the lease agreement, Linda could argue that under the lease agreement the wording indicates his right to ""floor area with common access to the common parking lot and a designated parking spot,"" and such the rear door is not included but then again he can say his ""common access"" is through the rear door. She gave fair notice. As a landlord she gave fair notice of when the contruction would happen and during the weekly calls she explains the reasons for the repair and why they take so long. However, whether Peter can also argue the amount of time she was given to make repairs was more than resonable. Provided Compensation. Once Peter told her of the issues she deducted $100 from the rent for the hassle. Which can be distingusihed from Hilder where there was no attempt of compensation from the landlord. during the weekly calls she explains the reasons for the repair and why they take so long.

Possiblility arugment against lack of abandonment. There is also a possible weakness of the fact that for a CE he would need to abandoned the property under a reasonable amount of time which technically he renewed in 2019 and in spring of 2019 the construction started, from that time the interference to now is only months. He has not abandoned the property and so Linda might be able to attack his claim of constructive eviction due to not abandoning under a reasonable amount of time but since it is less than a year it would not be a strong arugment. Linda kept communication and has rights as an owner. She could raise the arugment that as a landlord she held to the right of making improvments on the property as a true owner and her intention is to maintain the building. A possible rationale can be that an owner should be able to maintain the structure of her property without fear of losing rent from her tenant, if she gave reasonable notice, compensation, and kept communication open. Advice Although Peter has a possible claim to a breach of the CQE and CE there is a possibility that he would still be liable to paying the rent for the durration of his tenancy specified in the agreement.

341fa5ac-9454-425b-80af-ef56ba1dfca5," The issue of determining what interests Dana conveyed in Blackacre are best resolved in examining the Rules of Construction, as Dana's conveyance was ambigious; it used language both characteristic of a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (conditional language - ""provided that"") and a fee simple determinable (durational language - ""so long as""). Eve is most likely granted a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in this conveyance because of the ""provided that"" language used and the subsequent condition provided by Dana - ""...Eve does not attempt to sell the house. The house is not to be sold."" This situation is similar to that of the issue in White v. Brown, in which it was determined that a fee simple absolute was favored, not a life estate, because courts are increasingly looking at the grantor's intent (an additional guide by the Rules of Construction), and not always at the plain language of the conveyance or statute. The Rules of Construction also favor a fee simple subject to condition subsequent over a fee simple determinable and say that it is important to read the conveyance as a whole; in this conveyance, there are two parts that read more as a FSSCS, versus one part that appears more as a FSD. In a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the grantor may exercise his or her right to re-enter the property (power of termination). In a fee simple determinable, the power of reverter is automatically given. Dana holds the right of re-entry in this conveyance. Courts wish to promote productive use of land; if a grantor chooses to ""sleep"" on his or her right to enter a property, while the current tenant on the land is actively on the property and using the property, then courts are satisfied. Eve moved back to Blackacre upon the conveyance while Dana moves to Switzerland; Dana wishes for Eve to live on the property and considers Eve a sister. This further shows Dana's willingness and trust to convey the land and home to Eve; Dana would likely not exercise her right to re-entry or power of termination. Dana dies testate (with a will) and devises ""all her personal property"" to her daughter Fiona. This creates an issue for Eve when soliciting offers from real estate developers. Another issue created is that Fiona would like to move back to Blackacre (assuming Eve will pay for repairs, which is later discussed). Eve's strongest argument for soliciting the offers is her maintanence of the property while Dana and Fiona were away, and this argument is strengthened by Eve's own emotional ties to Blackacre created by her time spent there since 2010 and with the memories of Blackacre with Dana (the two grew up together on Blackacre when Eve's parents died). Courts often hold that emotional and sentimental values Dana dies testate (with a will) and devises ""all her personal property"" to her daughter Fiona. This creates an issue for Eve when soliciting offers from real estate developers. Another issue created is that Fiona would like to move back to Blackacre (assuming Eve will pay for repairs, which is later discussed). Eve's strongest argument for soliciting the offers is her maintanence of the property while Dana and Fiona were away, and this argument is strengthened by Eve's own emotional ties to Blackacre created by her time spent there since 2010 and with the memories of Blackacre with Dana (the two grew up together on Blackacre when Eve's parents died). Courts often hold that emotional and sentimental values should be factored into one's claim or interest in a property; the sole test is not economic value, as seen in the Ark Land case. In this case, Ark Land had already obtained some of the Caudille family shares of the land in question, and sought to obtain complete ownership of the land from the other heirs. The courts originally held for Ark Land, and promoted a partition by sale; however, later courts determined that society should favor partition by kind. Ultimately, some states have started to adopt policies that provide an appraisal process and a buyout guide. In Eve's case, while she has emotional ties to the property, she would like to part with the land due to its appreciation in value (and because she can no longer bear the emotional tolls); she can raise this to Fiona and perhaps come up with an equitable solution or form of relief, as seen in Woodrick v. Wood (the barn case). In Woodrick, the barn, while having emotional value, was not increasing the land's value; it was ultimately torn down, but the person tied to the barn received compensation for the destruction of it. Eve could consider and offer to share the profits made by selling the land with Fiona. Fiona may argue that not only did Dana's will leave all of Dana's property to Fiona, but also that Dana's conveyance explictly stated that the house should not be sold, nor should a sale be attempted. Fiona can say that because Dana's will left the property to Fiona, that Fiona did have a future interest in Blackacre (the conveyance, if assumed to be a FSSCS, would give Dana the right to re-entry, which is essentially now Fiona's right upon Dana's death). She can use this to reclaim ownership of Blackacre, and further argue that Eve should be accountable for the repairs on Blackacre due to this future interest. By common law, Fiona should receive the property in the condition it was given to Eve; presumably, the roof shingles were not missing and there was no cracked glass (and other such problems). Fiona's emotional ties to the property should also be factored into a decision by courts. Fiona and Eve should take these issues to court and have them resolved by the judicial system because there is an interest in promoting our judicial system and placing trust in the courts. Self-help and feuding are discouraged; it would be best to have these issues properly litigated so as any problems do not become violent between Fiona and Eve. Fiona likely has the stronger claim for ownership of Blackacre. Because of the will and her emotional ties to the property, and Dana's conveyance stating that the house should not be sold, Fiona can argue take these issues to court and have them resolved by the judicial system because there is an interest in promoting our judicial system and placing trust in the courts. Self-help and feuding are discouraged; it would be best to have these issues properly litigated so as any problems do not become violent between Fiona and Eve. Fiona likely has the stronger claim for ownership of Blackacre. Because of the will and her emotional ties to the property, and Dana's conveyance stating that the house should not be sold, Fiona can argue that Eve should not be freely soliciting offers on the property. Fiona can also argue that Eve should be responsible for the damages to the property because of her future interest in it. "," As a matter of formality, it could be mentioned to Peter that legally he is in a tenancy of years (January 1, 2019 - Decemebr 31, 2023) lease with Linda. Typically, this requires no notice of abandonment in advance if the tenant plans to leave upon the end of the fixed date. While Peter may want to remain on Main Street until this date (December 31, 2023), he can take Linda to court to determine whether the construction has risen to levels of actual/partial eviction, constructive eviction, or if he can receive damages for the inconveniences he's experienced. Peter could potentially meet actual/partial eviction because the construction equipment encroaches on his designated parking spot. In the Smith (brickwall) case, because the encroachment prohibited the tenant's free use of the entire land, the court held that there was actual eviction, and permitted abatement of rent. Since Peter does not want to leave the premises, he could argue for a further reduction of rent, or perhaps total abandonment of rent (putting the money into escrow until the payments are to start up again). Peter could also consider showing there has been constructive eviction. Should the courts determine there was constructive eviction, they would have to find that the interferences were ""so substantial"" in order to rise to this level. In the Reste Realty case, the flooding of the office was the ""crowning blow."" Peter could potentially make this argument in the rear door situation, specifically pointing to the difficulties created (customers not being able to navigate the scaffolding, pizza deliveries more difficult to accomplish/complete) with the construction largely blocking this area. If compared to the Bank case, these circumstances are likely to arise to Peter simply receiving damages. Like in the Bank case, it is not absolutely impossible for customers and pizza deliveries to use the back door; additionally, the lease does not say that Peter's business can only use this door. The construction in both of these cases has caused intereferences such as noise and dust. These would likely not be seen as ""so substantial,"" unless the dust was making its way into the kitchen, affecting the quality of Peter's products, the pizzas. It is the landlord's duty to the tenant to uphold the covenant of quiet enjoyment; landlord's are more accomplish/complete) with the construction largely blocking this area.

These would likely not be seen as ""so substantial,"" unless the dust was making its way into the kitchen, affecting the quality of Peter's products, the pizzas. It is the landlord's duty to the tenant to uphold the covenant of quiet enjoyment; landlord's are more familiar with their properties and should be mindful of a tenant's expectations. It is in the best interest of all parties that situations do not arise to the level of frustrations and evictions, particularly any means of self-help. If Peter wanted to argue constructive eviction, and ultimately move out of the space, he would need to give notice to Linda, consider the amount of time he has given Linda to make the repairs, and vacate in a timely fashion. Peter has met the first element of giving notice because he has called Linda expressing his concerns. He has allowed Linda enough time; it should be seen as reasonable that construction, originally to be complete in a week's time, should be complete after several months. Unfortunately, Peter has not vacated the premises, and it appears it may be too late to do so, unless he does so immediately. Although Peter is concerned about breaking the lease he has just renewed, courts have held that the notion of ""buyers beware"" should be rejected. In the Reste case, the defendant argued that the plaintiff had renewed her lease regardless of the conditions that had been ongoing. This argument was not upheld. Linda, however, could potentially raise this as a defense, citing that in some cases it has been considered that courts do not always want to punish the landlord for something that he or she could not control. It is an issue of fairness, although courts often look at evidence in the light most favorable to the tenant. Linda can also use Peter's regular check-ins to her defense; she continued to work with the construction company and her tenant to best understand what was taking so long and when repairs could be completed. She kept Peter informed and additionally deducted from his rent as compensation for the hassle. Linda could say that she attempted to mitigate the damages and provide some equitable relief for Peter. Ultimately, Peter likely has the strongest case in receiving damages or futher relief from Linda. The court may award him with damages, like in the Bank case, for the interferences, or perhaps hold that Peter may abate his rent until the construction is complete. If Peter would like to stay on Main Street, these are his best options and he should take the case to court. Linda may want to negotiate and settle outside of court, as likely neither of them would want any public records of the issues raised in court. hassle.

346c7a84-2b02-4aaa-81f4-4ae8633b9b69," - What kind of interests were created by Diana's conveyance and why? The primary issue is regarding the interest created by Diana's conveyance because her conveyance is ambiguous in multiple ways. At the time of conveyance, it appears that Eve either has a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent as determined by the phrase ""provided that"" which indicates conditional language. However, the conveyance also stipulates that Diana conveys Blackacre ""so long as"" which creates durational language indicating a Fee Simple Determinable. When an ambiguous conveyance arises, the courts first look to the Rules of Construction to guide their interpretation of the conveyance. The Rules of Conveyance are: look at the intent of the parties; read the document as a whole; avoid partial intestacy; favor free alienability; favor Fee Simple Absolute; and favor an FSSCS over an FSD. Here, the first issue with the conveyance is whether Diana intended to convey an FSD or FSSCS. Typically, the rules of construction favor an FSSCS over an FSD. The grantor in an FSSCS has the Right to Re-Entry, meaning that once the stipulated condition is met, the grantor must re-enter the property to assert their right. In an FSD the grantor has the possibility of reverter which occurs automatically. In Mahrenholz, the court ruled that the use of the word ""only"" in conjunction with the remainder of the conveyance indicated that the grantor intended to give an FSD rather than an FSSCS. Diana has not used the word ""only"" here and her language is a direct contradiction from one another and given that there is no indication that she would prefer an FSD over an FSSCS (only that she does not want the house to be sold, it is likely that the court will rule that this is an FSSCS due to the rules of construction and language in the conveyance ""provided that."" The second issue with the ambiguous conveyance is that it is that D created a partial intestacy by not specifying who would get Blackacre should Eve sell the house and if she is dead (can no longer have a reversion). Since the Rules of Construction favor the avoidance of partial intestacy, the Eve may argue that she has the property in Fee Simple Absolute while Fiona will likely want to argue that the court should look at the intent of the parties to determine that once Eva attempts to sell the property, that it should go back to the estate. Since Fiona has Diana's remaining property, it may go back to her. In White v. Brown, the grantor conveyed a similar estate that stipulated that she wanted the house to be lived in and not to be sold. The majority looked to the rules of construction, specifically that the court should favor Fee Simple Absolute. As such, the majority stated that because the conveyance was too reversion). Since the Rules of Construction favor the avoidance of partial intestacy, the Eve may argue that she has the property in Fee Simple Absolute while Fiona will likely want to argue that the court should look at the intent of the parties to determine that once Eva attempts to sell the property, that it should go back to the estate. Since Fiona has Diana's remaining property, it may go back to her. In White v. Brown, the grantor conveyed a similar estate that stipulated that she wanted the house to be lived in and not to be sold. The majority looked to the rules of construction, specifically that the court should favor Fee Simple Absolute. As such, the majority stated that because the conveyance was too ambiguous to determine the intent of the parties, they should favor FSA. The dissent disagreed, stating the the majority had carefully selected only parts of cases to support their argument and failed to read its supporting evidence as a whole; and moreover, that the grantor in this case had already made another gift in her conveyance and thus knew how to write such a thing indicating further that she purposefully intended to only create a life estate on the condition that the house not be sold. Here, Diana clearly indicated that she did not want the house sold and has made it known that she wats to keep Blackacre in her family. The court may rule here, that Diana's conveyance was similarly ambiguous and that they should look to the intent of the parties to determine whether or not the property should return to the estate on the attempt of sale. Any arguments that Eve could make that she should be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre? The second issue is whether Eve can make a successful argument that she should be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre. Eve should argue that given the ambiguous conveyance, the court should interpret this to be similar to the majority opinion of White v. Brown in which the court heavily leaned in favor of a Fee Simple Absolute in an ambiguous conveyance. Eve should make the argument that because there is an partial intestacy in Diana's will, that she likely intended it to remain with Eve. Eve should argue that it would be economic waste not to sell the property. Economic waste is not using the property in its most productive capacity. This is similar to the ruling in Baker v. Weedon in which the future interest holders wanted to sell the property becasue there was going to be a highway put in which would greatly increase the value of the property. Their grandfather's wife did not want to sell the property as she was currently living on it. Ultimately the court ruled that it was economic waste not to sell the party but remanded to the lower court to find an equitable solution. Eve should make a waste not to sell the property, and given similar argument here and say that it would be economic Diana's ambiguous conveyance, they should be free to do so. Eve should also make an argument that there can be an equitable solution between her and Fiona if Fiona's inheritance of personal property and which the future interest holders wanted to sell the property becasue there was going to be a highway put in which would greatly increase the value of the property. Their grandfather's wife did not want to sell the property as she was currently living on it. Ultimately the court ruled that it was economic waste not to sell the party but remanded to the lower court to find an equitable solution. Eve should make a similar argument here and say that it would be economic waste not to sell the property, and given Diana's ambiguous conveyance, they should be free to do so. Eve should also make an argument that there can be an equitable solution between her and Fiona if Fiona's inheritance of personal property and possibly suggest that if she were to sell the property then she could share the profits from the sale with Fiona. Secondly, Eve should argue that the sale of the property may be considered ameliorative waste but this should not be prohibitive. Ameliorative Waste is the purposeful action of the present interest holder which increases the value of the property. The court in Woodrick v. Wood found that ameliorative waste is not necessarily ""wasteful"" in its definitional term and may be permissible, although they may call for an equitable solution. If Fiona decides to make an argument that Eve has caused permissive waste, then Eve may have counter arguments although they may be weak. Permissive waste occurs when the present interest holder is negligent towards the property causing neglectful deterioration. Here, Eve may counter Fiona's arguments by saying it was not permissive waste because she locked the house and took measures to maintain the property by putting the real estate taxes on auto pay and later returning to the property. Does Fiona have basis for reclaiming ownership or for holding eve accountable for the repairs needed on Blackacre? The next issue is whether Fiona has a basis for reclaiming ownership/holding Eve accountable for the repairs needed on Blackacre. Fiona may have an argument on the basis of Waste. There are four kinds of waste: economic (failure to use the property in the most productive capacity); ameliorative waste (purposeful action of the present interest holder which increases teh value of the property); permissive waste (neglectful actions by the present interest holder which decrease the value of the property); and affirmative waste (purposeful actions which decrease the value of the property). Fiona should argue that by her neglect of the property when she moved to Florida and let the house fall into disarray (roof shingles missing, glass is cracked, and other serious problems) that Eve committed Permissive Waste and thus Eve should be responsible for paying for the repairs needed for Blackacre. Second, similar to Ark Land v. Harper in which the coal company argued that it would be economic waste not to force a to 8look at not just economic interest, but balance that partition in sale and the court ruled that it is crucial with emotional interests as well, Fiona should argue that the economic interests of selling the house should be balanced with the emotional interests in the property which she has.

Fiona should argue that she wants to move back and again, that Diana made specific requests for the house to stay in the family. Fiona should also argue that like in Wood v. Woodrick, she is entitled to some form of equitable relief due to emotional interests as the court provided the daughter when the barn was torn down. There they provided her financial compensation for the removal of the barn and here, Fiona may be entitled ot same on the same basis. Lastly, Fiona should also make an argument (albiet weak) that Eve violated the condition of the conveyance when she first ""attempted"" to make a sale. The deed stipulates that the property goes to Eve ""... so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house."" Fiona should argue that by not refuting the offer for the house, Eve has essentially attempted to make a sale thus violating the condition of the conveyance. "," The primary issue to address in whether or not Peter (T) has legal rights for action in this case is to determine whether the Landlord, Linda, (LL) has committed a breach. First, we must determine the type of tenancy that Peter has. There are four types of tenancy (term of years, tenancy at suffrage, periodic tenancy, tenancy at will). Since Peter's current lease runs for a specified period of time (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2023), Peter has a term of yeras lease. This type of tenancy does not require that Peter give notice of termination because it will terminate automatically upon the end of the lease in December of 2023. In this type of tenancy, the tenant (T) is liable for rent through the end of the lease. In this case, T would be liable for rent through December 31, 2023. The situations in which the T may not be liable for rent are in cases of eviction and include active, partial, or constructive eviction. To determine whether T has any right to leave and will not be responsible for paying rent, we must next determine if the LL breached, and if the breach resulted in an eviction. T may show a breach in two ways: one a breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment or a breach of contract (lease). First, the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (CQE) stipulatest that all lease holders (whether in a residential or commercial lease) are entitled to the quiet enjoyment of their property without for rent are in cases of eviction and include active, partial, or constructive eviction. To determine whether T has any right to leave and will not be responsible for paying rent, we must next determine if the LL breached, and if the breach resulted in an eviction. T may show a breach in two ways: one a breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment or a breach of contract (lease). First, the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (CQE) stipulatest that all lease holders (whether in a residential or commercial lease) are entitled to the quiet enjoyment of their property without distrubance by the LL, LL's agents, or individuals of higher title. A breach of the CQE can result in an actual eviction, partial eviction, constructive eviction, or damages. In some cases, the LL may also breach the Implied Warranty of Habitability; however, this is only appliable to residential cases, not commercial. Here, T's best argument would be that he was constructively evicted from the premises. In order to show constructive eviction, the T must show that (1) the LL has interfered with their quiet enjoyment; (2) the intereference was substantial; (3) the T notified the LL of the issue and provided reasonable time for a response; and (4) the T must (typically) vacate the premises. First, the T must show that the LL has interefered with their right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises. In Reste Realty (flooding case), the court found that due to consistent and substantial flooding without proper repairs, the T had been constructively evicted even though it took her a substantial period of time to leave. In Reste, the ""crowning blow"" was a major flood that caused the tenant to have to host a sales meeting in a hotel nearby. Here, T could argue the construction is substantial as it has gone on for months and that the crowning blow is that his revenue is starting to be impacted. This is similar to Reste Realty in which the flooding also started to impact the T's business. This would meet the first and second element of the requirements of constructive eviction in that the LL has called for the construction and it has substantiall impacted the tenancy and his use of the property. While in Echo v. North Conway Bank, the court found that the construction that was being done was not substantial enough to be considered to cause constructive eviction on its own. Here, the construction has been continuous for months on end and given T's prior conversations with his LL there is no indication that she knows when this will end, meaning that it could potentially be on a semi permanent basis. The LL will likely use Echo to argue that this is not permanent, but T should refute by pointing out that she clearly does not know when the construction will end by their weekly conversations and her constant reassurances. T should argue that like in Reste, the construction is similar to flooding, in that we know it will continue until the repairs are completely made and as such, it is as if it were permenant. T also may be able to argue that by deducting $100 from his rent that LL is acknowledging some kind of constructive eviction and wrongdoing on her part. LL may argue her deduction from the rent was essentially the same as paying T for damages as a result of the construction permanent basis. The LL will likely use Echo to argue that this is not permanent, but T should refute by pointing out that she clearly does not know when the construction will end by their weekly conversations and her constant reassurances. T should argue that like in Reste, the construction is similar to flooding, in that we know it will continue until the repairs are completely made and as such, it is as if it were permenant. T also may be able to argue that by deducting $100 from his rent that LL is acknowledging some kind of constructive eviction and wrongdoing on her part. LL may argue her deduction from the rent was essentially the same as paying T for damages as a result of the construction and as such, she should not be liable for any further damages. T also must show that he notified LL of the issue and provided reasonable time for a response. Here, we know that T initially called LL after the construction equipment began to encroach on his parking spot which is designated solely to him in the lease. T then called LL every week and she explains why the repairs are taking so long, although this does not remedy his impact on his store's revenue. As such, T will likely meet the third element to show a constructive eviction. T will not be able to meet the fourth element of constructive eviction until he leaves the property. The LL will likely make an argument similar to the LL's argument in Reste Realty. There, the LL argued that the T failed to move out for months despite constant flooding and essentially argued that if the disturbance was so substantial, the T would have left long before and would not have resigned with the LL. The court found that argument to be unsound and reasoned that the T was attempting to give ample time for repairs to be fixed and may have thought that the new LL would have been better able to do so. The court discarded the previous common law rule of ""caveat emptor"" or buyer beware which the LL used as part of his argument and stated that a reasonable time to move out is determined on a case-by-case basis given the speicfic facts of the case. Similarly, here, the LL will likely argue that T's failure to move out of the building despite constant construction shows essentially that the construction is not bad enough to cause the tenant to move out, and thus does not constitute constructive eviction. T should argue that as in Reste Realty, given his past and good relationship with the LL and her response to deduct rent for what she admitted to be a ""hassle,"" he anticipated that when he was told the construction was ony supposed to be a week, he was anticipating that it would stop soon. As such, should T decide to leave the apartment and withhold rent, he may have a strong argument. The second broad argument T may make, is a breach of contract although this will be weaker than the first. T may have a weaker argument that there was a breach of the terms of the lease. The terms of the lease stipulated that there is a ""common right of access thereto, a common use of the parking lot, and one designated parking spot."" The court in Echo had a similar set of facts and determined that the word ""common"" should be read in normal contract terms to be used by everyone. The LL will likely make this argument. T, however, should state that it is not only common spaces that are being impacted by withhold rent, he may have a strong argument. The second broad argument T may make, is a breach of contract although this will be weaker than the first. T may have a weaker argument that there was a breach of the terms of the lease. The terms of the lease stipulated that there is a ""common right of access thereto, a common use of the parking lot, and one designated parking spot."" The court in Echo had a similar set of facts and determined that the word ""common"" should be read in normal contract terms to be used by everyone. The LL will likely make this argument. T, however, should state that it is not only common spaces that are being impacted by the construction, but spaces designated to him in the lease. Specifically, his parking spot and a secondary impact on his customers ability to enter which has thus impacted his revenue. T may also be able to make a very weak argument for an actual partial eviction by the construction impacting his ability to utilize his parking space. In Smith McEnany, the court ruled that actual eviction from part of the property (i.e. not being able to use the property - in that case as a result from the construction of a brick wall) means that you do not have to pay rent from the whole. A modern day court would likely require renegotiation of the lease in order to resolve the issue. LL may argue that her $100 deduction constitutes such a renegotiation for a partial eviction. If T does decide to move out the LL will have a duty to re-let the apartment to another T as stipulated in Sommer v. Kridel. The court in Sommer ruled that the LL has a duty to mitigate damages from a T leaving and the burden of the proof is on the LL, not the T (unlike in contracts cases where the breaching party has the burden of proof). The LL may show their attempt to re-let through advertisements in magazines, online, in newspapers, etc. The T has the option to rebut the proof that the LL has presented. In terms of advising T, it would be best to advise him to ensure that the LL is notified, to wait a reasonable time after notification of the LL to move out, if he decides to move out and withhold rent, to keep it in escrow to show the court that he had the funds available but was choosing not to pay because the LL constructively evicted him.

faca6a15-3d4c-4771-ad55-f8fc6f55b71a," Remember iRAc FSDPOR - Frank Sinatra doesn't prefer orville red ..... Fee simple determinable, possibility of reverter ... PoR FSSCS - parseltongue.. harry potter.. voldemort.. power of terminiation, right of (re)entry ... PoT/RoE Rules of construction Waste What kinds of interests were created by Dana's conveyance, and why? Dana's conveyance seems ambiguous to me because of the language ""provided that"" which insinuates a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD) and ""so long as"" which insinuates a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS). This reminds me of the marenholtz case where the property was to be used for the school. In that case we discussed the Rules of construction in which a FSSCS is preferred over an FSD. Going through each part, if Dana intended Eve to have a FSD, then Dana herself would retain a future interest as Possibility of Reverter in Fee Simple Absolute. On the other hand is Dana intended Eve to have a FSSCS, then Dana herself would retain a future interest as Power of Termination, Right of (re)Entry in Fee Simple Absolute. Another part of the rules of construction is that the intent of the grantor is to be considered as well as the coneyance to be read as a whole. Theoretically, according to this conveyance Fiona has no future interests and assuming that Dana did not include her daughter Fiona in the conveyance because she didn't want Blackacre (although she wanted it to remain in the family), it looks as though Eve would inherit Blackacre in Fee Simple Absolute (FSA). Dana's will states that Fiona inherits all her personal property, which would in fact include Blackacre Dana, as grantor, retained a future interest (Also according to the statutory provisions of New Suffolk General laws, future interests are inheritable). According to the statutory provisions of New Suffolk General laws, If the property isn't distributed according to the will 2(Which says Fiona inherits), the property shall first be distributed to 'issue', which is still Fiona. Then ancestors (I assume if Dana has died, so have her ancestors) then to collateral relatives which would now include Eve, so again Fiona seems to be the family), it looks as though Eve would inherit Blackacre in Fee Simple Absolute (FSA). Dana's will states that Fiona inherits all her personal property, which would in fact include Blackacre Dana, as grantor, retained a future interest (Also according to the statutory provisions of New Suffolk General laws, future interests are inheritable). According to the statutory provisions of New Suffolk General laws, If the property isn't distributed according to the will (Which says Fiona inherits), the property shall first be distributed to 'issue', which is still Fiona. Then ancestors (I assume if Dana has died, so have her ancestors) then to collateral relatives which would now include Eve, so again Fiona seems to be the primary choice when looking at statutory provisions and Dana's will, not the conveyance. If Fiona were to have a future interest, my best guess is that she would have a (springing) executory interest. Are there any arguments that Eve could make that she sould be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre? In either a FSD or FSSCS, Dana's specific language of the conveyance states she does not want the house to be sold and the condition that she does no attempt to sell. The developer reached out to Eve, so techinically speaking, Eve has not tried to sell Blackacre and hasn't violated any condition, yet. If we are consider that Fiona doesn't have any future interest, and Dana dies, it could be said that Eve owns Blackacre in FSA, and can do with it what she wants, allowing her to sell it. However, a stronger argument seems to be that at the time of Dana's death, looking at both the will giving property to Fiona, Dana's intention for Blackacre to remain in the family, and Eve's action to abandon Blackacre, it seems as though she would not be permitted to solicit offers and Blackacre would go to Fiona. The other argument in favor of allowing Eve to sell Blackacre, is the case where the older woman didn't want her house to be sold but it was so dilapitated that her family ended up selling it anyway. The fact pattern states that after Eve left (for the 5 years) the house had missing roof shingles, cracked glass, and other serious problems attributed to the cold New Suffolk Weather. If the home could no longer be used as a home, then Eve may have an argument allowing her to sell. Does Fiona have any basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre and/or for holding Eve accountable for the repairs needed on Blackacre? As stated above, although Fiona is not in the conveyance itself, looking at the statutory language and Dana's will, as Dana's 'issue', Fiona would inherit Blackacre. If Fiona could show that Eve's abandoning the property was waste (I can't recall if this would be permissive or affirmative, or both? Because she wasn't using it as a true owner would, 'sleeping on it', and was allowing damage to happen), then Fiona Does Fiona have any basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre and/or for holding Eve accountable for the repairs needed on Blackacre? As stated above, although Fiona is not in the conveyance itself, looking at the statutory language and Dana's will, as Dana's 'issue', Fiona would inherit Blackacre. If Fiona could show that Eve's abandoning the property was waste (I can't recall if this would be permissive or affirmative, or both? Because she wasn't using it as a true owner would, 'sleeping on it', and was allowing damage to happen), then Fiona may be entitled to recovering damages for Blackacre. If based on the rules of construction and FSSCS is preferred, and we assume it is such, Dana's right of termination and power of (re)entry is transferred to Fiona, and Fiona can terminate Eve's right to Blackacre. Although it may be weak, another argument I am thinking of is the Ark Land case where the court weighed multiple factors including economic and sentimental, suggesting there may be a partition in kind as well as a partition of sale. No specific dimentions are stated in the fact pattern, but, maybe, Fiona could retain the home itself considering its newly found sentimental value, Eve could sell the land around the house, keep the profit minus the costs of repairs for the home itself. If Blackacre in its entirety were to be partitioned by sale, either party could have the option of buying the other one out, unlike in Arkland where clearly Arkland had the financial resources to take the property at auction. The act (Uniform property?) we discussed in class states that neither party should be prejudiced. "," Remember iRAc Peter has a tenancy in term of years Can't remember how much notice he must give, a month? 90 days? Tenancy in common with other people in the commericial building (common parking lot, common entry ways Constructive eviction - bank case - significant interfearance (like being evicted) - T must give LL notice and reasonable time to fix issue - T must leave for it to matter Tenancy in common with other people in the commericial building (common parking lot, common entry ways Constructive eviction - bank case - significant interfearance (like being evicted) - T must give LL notice and reasonable time to fix issue - T must leave for it to matter - offices with water damage case - cockroach case Brick wall case with 'minor encroachement' constituting actual eviction Implied warranty of habitability Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment Peter has several arguments that he could make to support him leaving. First and foremost, if he leaves, with this being a tenancy in terms of years he must give Linda notice and is responsible for some of the rent but not the remaining 5 years. I can't recall if he has to give her a months notice or 90 days notice, but he would be responsible for that remainder of the rent, again not the entirety of the lease if contructive eviction is found here. It would be incredibly unfair to force a tenant to remain in an unsatistfactory situation just because they signed a long-term lease. In addtion, it seems Peter has been renting this space for 12 years without issue, until now. Linda gave Peter advanced notice of the construction and he chose to go on vacation for the week he thought it would take to finish. I don't believe this week can necessarily be factored directly into either constructive eviction or actual eviction, because of the advanced notice and Peters voluntary choice to go on vacation. However, when he returned to unfinished work, I believe this is where the issues arise. In order to consitiute as constructive eviction, the Tenant must give the Landlord notice of the issues and reasonable time to fix the issues. Peter was consistantly notifying Linda of the problems, and although she was sympathetic and reduced his rent by $100, the issues persisted for months without any improvement. The tenant must actually leave in order for it to be consisdered constructive eviction, here Peter has stayed in these conditions for months, and that may be a weakness in his case. However, it can be said that he stayed relying on Linda's information that the construction would be done within a week. and reasonable time to fix the issues.

However, it can be said that he stayed relying on Linda's information that the construction would be done within a week. In addition, I think of the cockroach case example we discussed where the tenant informed the landlord of the issue, she prompty got exterminators, the problem persisted and it seemed to be caused by the tenant themselves, being generally unhygenic. Here, this construction issue is clearly not Peter's fault. As stated above, Peter did inform Linda of the issues, she reduced his rent but otherwise the problem persisted without a solution although she was given plently of time to make repairs/find a solution. I can't recall if the implied warranty of habitability is just for residential buildings or can also be used for commerical. I believe it's just residentional. However, the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment has clearly been breached by the following: the noise and the dust from construction causing Peter to have to keep the windows closed, the scaffolding largely blocking the rear entrance causing difficulties with peters customers, delivery drivers cars/deliveries and Peter's personal parking space, the construction equipment encroaching on his parking space further causing difficulty with parking, and the continuous decline in sales from the pizza shop. There are several specific facts that can be compared to other cases. First, the bank case where the bank was under construction causing loud noises and issues with entering for the tenants. Here, the construction equipment is also loud for Peter and his customers. Although like the bank there was another entrance, unlike the bank, the rear door seems to be how a significant amount of Peter's customers enter, where he parks and enters and how he makes his deliveries which shows a significant interferance in his daily business because the scaffolding is largely blocking the area. I believe in the bank case it wasn't considered constructive eviction because they had other ways to enter the building and didn't leave. That may be a weakness for Peter because there seems to be another entrance for the pizza shop on Main street. However, unlike with the bank, here it seems the rear entrance is where a large amount of activity occurs and is significantly detrimental to Peter's overall business. The employees may have still been able to enter the bank, but here it's taking a large amount of effort to enter and exit the pizza shop, which seems to be deterring customers from going to the pizza shop anymore, and his staff is having trouble making deliveries on time. bank case it wasn't considered constructive eviction because they had other ways to enter the building and didn't leave.

In addition, when looking at the minor encroachment by the construction equipment onto Peter's personal parking space, I am reminded of the brick wall case where although the encroachment was also minor, it was considered an actual eviction (I believe because they could no longer park their wagon there? Not completely sure of that part.) Here, although Peter can 'squeeze' into the spot, he also can't park as close to the rear door because of the scaffolding as well. These two elements are diminishing his ability to conduct business. He uses that spot close to the rear door to park his personal car and the area to bring pizza's to a delivery person's car (who previously could pull up close) to then deliver. With the obstruction, it makes it nearly impossible to carry the pizza's through the 'maze of scaffolding' and into the delivery persons car itself. Yet another case is the office building that was consistently being flooded. The tenant was misplaced multiple times, and the office could effectively not be used as an office while flooding occured. The original landlord tried to fix multiple issues and after his death the successor made little to no attempts although the tenant informed him of multiple issues before having to vacate the property. Again, Peter has been persistant in contacting Linda, and the problem continued past days and weeks into months. It seems as though Peter pizza shop can't be effectively used as a pizza shop under the current conditions. Peter seems to have an incredibly strong case for constructive eviction considering all the evidence in the fact pattern. The 'strongest' argument I see for Linda is that Peter has not actually left the property, and in an effort to appease the situation did reduce his rent. This, however, still seems weak considering multiple factors. His rent is $2,000 a month, the $100 reduction can barely be considered helpful. If the problem has been going on for months, and the facts say his revenues are down, its fair to assume he's losing a lot more than $100 a month, and it's not equal. If you do add on the week he went on vacation thats another week of lost profits for Peter. factors. His rent is $2,000 a month, the $100 reduction can barely be considered helpful.

140fa70f-38c7-45ce-86f4-f66ecc52218d," The interests that were created by Dana's conveyance, at the time when the conveyance was made would be Eve would have a Fee simple subject to condition subsequent and Dana would have a right to re-enter / power of termination. This is the case because the phrase, ""provided that"" and ""so long as"" are used to make a Fee simple subject to condition subsequent. The right to re-enter / power of termination will allows follow a Fee simple subject to condition subsequent if, the land will go back to the original granter. The conveyances after the death of Dana and current would be Eve would have a Fee simple subject to condition subsequent and Dana's estate would have a right to re-enter / power of termination. Becuase the Estate would have to be passed on, the Dana's will should direct where her interest in Blackarce will fall. Dana's will does not appear to take about real property only personal which means the rules of intestate would take effect. The issue of Dana will be her heirs so, that would be her daughter Fiona. Thus the The conveyances after the death of Dana and current would be Eve would have a Fee simple subject to condition subsequent and Fiona would have a right to re-enter / power of termination. There is no exectory interest because the conveyance did not create on even know a third party will hold the future interest in Blackarce. Eve must follow the conveyance which states,""Eve does not attempt to sell the house. The house should not be sold."" This leaves a look of room to move around when looking at the rule of conveyance. Two of which are the conveyance should be read as a whole and the conveyance should attempt to follow the writers wishes. If the conveyance is read as a whole Eve should not try to sell or sell Blackarce. That is very start forward. When looking at the seond rule, attempt to follow the writers wishes then Eve should be able to get price for the home, see what the house is worth but follow the wishes's of Dana which is not to have blackarce sold. On the flip side a Court could follow the, White v. Brown case in which the conveyance/ Will stated that the house should not be sold. However the district court order the sale of the home. Apply the White v. Brown case to Eve problem, the court could disregard some part of the conveyance or read it in a very unqiune way. Which could allow Eve to have more or less no condiction put upon her. Another rule of conveyance is free alienation of property is peferred, which is when a person is able to use the property without restriction. Which means the Court could have a reason to remove any restriction of the use or sale of Blackarce in order the wishes's of Dana which is not to have blackarce sold.

Another rule of conveyance is free alienation of property is peferred, which is when a person is able to use the property without restriction. Which means the Court could have a reason to remove any restriction of the use or sale of Blackarce in order to better follow the rules of conveyance. Econamic waste looks to say a tenent must use the property in the way that would make the best econamic sense which come from the Highway case (whith the grandkids from the first and second marriage who the state highway depertment informs have a future interest in the land.) Blackarce may be a better ecomanmic use to sell the land then to allow the esatate just to sit around.Which would make it so Eve is committing an action of waste by not selling the land. Eve would need to be able to get offers for blackarce to have a price point to know what the possable ecominic output could be. This idea would be test by the court because the fact pattern does not say what the land would be used for if sold becuase growing corn might be better ecomanmic than having a house sitting on the land. Thus, Eve would be required to sell Blackarce in order not to commit waste had harm the future interest holders. Fiona would not have the right to re-enter blackarce. Eve holds blackarce as Fee simple subject to condition subsequent so, the condition must be meet. Having a person asking if you are willing to sell the proptery does not meet that condition. The condition would be broken if Eve is the one that is seeking to sell the house. However, that might be a little more trickty to see, see above. However, the action in the fact pattern appear that the condition has not been broken thus Fiona has no legal right to retake the property. Fiona could claim by getting an offer, that is Eve attempting to see the house which would break the condition. A court will likely not view it in Fiona's favour because a spam email or junk mail that gives a price to buy your home would violoate the condtion which would be something that is outside of Eve's control. The under pinnings of policy is here to show that there are firm rules to conveyances which can not be change at a drop of a hat rather allowing people to be conformable to know the rules and what is going on around them. The idea of permissive waste is that a person does nothing and allows the esatate to fall into a state which the value of the estate is decreased. Eve does nothing to Blackarce and that is what happens. outside of Eve's control.

The idea of permissive waste is that a person does nothing and allows the esatate to fall into a state which the value of the estate is decreased. Eve does nothing to Blackarce and that is what happens. There is to things that Eve could do to resolve the problem at hand the first is to make the repairs to blackarce to get it back to its old glory or just like the Barn case the person on the land could pay for the damage that was done to property. So, the future interset holder would have cash in hand that which would be measure by the origianl value of the property minus the current value of the property. Eve should be held resoanble for the damage that has come to blackarce due to her inaction. The under pinnings of policy is here to show that a future interest holders have a way to make sure their interest does not become worthless over time. Which "," Peter should first be informed about the Convent of Quiet enjoyment (CQE) which has three parts which is Partial actual eviction, Constructive eviction and damages. The CQE is impleid so every single lease will have it regard of what the lease property would be used for; however, the CQE can be waived. I must assume that Peter's lease did not waive the CQE. The first woudl be Partial actual eviction which is show by the Brick wall case where the landlord take back a very small piece of land from the lease property which in make it so the renter did not have the whole property that he was renting. This case shows that eviction from part of the land is eviction from the whole land. This is done because you pay for the whole land and you should be able to enjoy the whole thing. The restatement would seek to find a middle ground which the rent is redue in exchange for giving up the right to that land. In this case Peter lease is for the the shop space, the common area, common use of the parking lot and one designated spot. Peter could claim Partial actual eviction because the construction equipment has take over a small part of his designated spot, if it is over the white line that it is encouching into his designated spot which peter has exclusive use of. Just like the brick wall case a small encouchment no matter how small is a partial actual eviction.The under pinnings of policy is here to show that the tenent has rights that can not be taken away by the landlord and has a way to enfoce those rights in Court. Linda most likily would say that they found a middle ground for that small encouchment by reducing the rent by $100 per month. Peter could 4claim that reducement is for the hassle of the construction work in gerenal not for the Partial actual eviction. his designated spot which peter has exclusive use of.

Peter could claim that reducement is for the hassle of the construction work in gerenal not for the Partial actual eviction. The second part of the CQE is constructive eviction which is the events so bad it as if they have been evicted. This idea comes from the flooding case in which every single time it rain the lease area would flood and make it so, the space was more or less unuseable. The scaffolding has in the parking lot has made it hard for people to coming in and out of place place as well as employees that are delivering the pies to people. The scaffolding has made it so that Peter can not run his pizza place like normal. The nosie and dust has forced the pizza place to keep the window closed, this may be a choice. However the place with the oven has to follow health and safety standards so, they might not be able to open the windows and risk the dust getting in because it might be unsafe to eat pizza with dust on it. The under pinnings of policy is here to show a the tenent has a recousre if the landlord is makeing using the property so hard it is as if the tenent was evicted. Linda would cite the Echo v. North Conway Bank (Echo) case on the notion that the court should read the lease and see if all the funtions can happen.If peter has the shop space, the common area, common use of the parking lot and one designated spot. Then the lease is being fullfilled and not broken. Just like Echo the loction had two ways in and out with one of them being made harder to use during construction. The court held Echo only had the right to have aceess and the lease did not grant permitted access through a certain door rahter just gerenal. Linda would make the same agruement saying the front door access meets the terms of the lease which only grants gerenal access. The under pinnings of policy is here to show the landlord has the ability to enforce the lease based on the fact value of what the lease said. If, Peter wants to claim Constructive eviction under the CQE then, he has to give Linda notice of the problem, give linda reasonable time amout of time to fix the problem and then leave the property. The best course of action would be putting the rent money in an escrow amount when the suit is being brought into court. On the notion that if the Linda is found not to have Constructive evicted Peter then peter could be held liable for the remaining rent . The last part of the CQE would be damges. Which would be cash that Peter could get from Linda because the events have been that bad moving forward. Peter could claim that he should be able to get problem, give linda reasonable time amout of time to fix the problem and then leave the property. The best course of action would be putting the rent money in an escrow amount when the suit is being brought into court. On the notion that if the Linda is found not to have Constructive evicted Peter then peter could be held liable for the remaining rent . The last part of the CQE would be damges. Which would be cash that Peter could get from Linda because the events have been that bad moving forward. Peter could claim that he should be able to get the an award for the lost profit from the pizza shop. Damages can be award without the Court finding that there was a Partial actual eviction or Constructive eviction which was the case in the Echo Case. The under pinnings of policy is here to show the tenent has a way to show the landlord how bad the events are becoming before it rise to the leave in which a person would need to leave. There is a thing known as the Impilied Warrenty of Hability (IWH) which requires rented homes to meet certain health and safety codes. This would not apply in this case becasue the lease is not dealing with rented homes rather it is a pizza place. If Peter leave he could leave the property in one of two way by either surredering the property or abandonment. When surredering the property the landlord and the tenent would agree to end the lease which would make it so as if the lease just expired. If, the landlord choices not to accept the surreder or the tenenet does not seek the ok of the landlord and leaves the property then the property is abandon. Which means the tenent is liable for the rest of the rent for the lease period. The ""newelywed"" case ( the guy that got dump at the alter or right before the wedding) shows the landlord must activeily accept the surreder and if the landlord does not then the property is abandon. The same case makes it so the landlord needs to try to reduce the damages by finding someone new to rent the property out to. The landLord still can seek the renter for when the property had no new tenent and the cost of work, overhead for seeking a new person to rent out the property. The under pinnings of policy is here to show there is a way that the landlord and tenent can end the lease on the same common ground. As well as having a way the tenent can be let off the hook when the landlord gets what they want which is a person paying rent. As well as putting the to work because they are in the best postion to rent out the property. The overarching advice I would give to Peter is, see if Linda will again redue the rent becasue of the hassle of the construction. If, not see if Linda is willing to accept the surreder of the property in order to get out of the lease. If, not see if Linda is willing to modifity the terms of the lease to redue the term of years. If, not see if make a claim for Partial actual eviction because it does not require you to leave. The last option would be making a claim of constructive eviction which requires Peter to leave and if it property.

The last option would be making a claim of constructive eviction which requires Peter to leave and if it is not found that peter was Constructive eviction then, he would be liable for the rest of the rent. However, it might not be the whole term because Lindia is required to try to reduce the damages by seeking out other people to rent the space. ",1243,1637
b71309dc-bce9-4e0f-b5aa-1c3c1231a313," In determining the interests of the parties in blackacre, we must first look at the intent of the party conveying the property. From the language of the conveyance, it seems as though Dana wishes for Eve to own/use the property and in the event that she attempts to sell the house, Dana would be able to step in to prevent the sale and retake the property. Eve's interest in the land is likely to be in Fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) which would mean Dana, as the grantor, would have a future interest of power of termination/right of entry. The rules of construction for conveyances are used here to determine the conveyance as the language of the conveyance is ambiguous. The rules of construction tell us to favor a fee simple subject to condition subsequent over a fee simple determinable (FSD). This is because in the event that the condition is broken, the FSSCS allows the grantor to have the right of entry and power of termination while the FSD gives the grantor the possibility of reverter which, automatically reverts the property to the grantor once the condition is broken. In the Marenholz case, the court strayed from the rule of construction and found that the conveyance was a FSD. For that reason, it is important to consider the parties rights and interests if eve has a FSSCS or FSD as the court may hold the conveyance to be either. It is important to note that Fiona's interest in the land is through her mothers estate. In the event of Dana dying, her estate would still possess the future interest and it would be the responsibility of the executor of the estate to exercise the power of termination or right of entry if Eve broke the condition. Eve could make the argument that she should be permitted to solicit offers and holds blackacre in fee simple absolute (FSA). Similarly to the white v brown case, where the grantor conveyed the land with a condition that it could never be sold, the courts want to favor a FSA and the free alienability of property. It could be argued, weakly, by Eve that the conveyance here is similar to that in white v brown and that the condition that the house not be attempted to sell may not apply. I do not think that will be the case because the language in the conveyance here points more towards a condition subsequent (or FSD). Eve can make additional claims to sell the property that will be addressed later on. In regard to Fiona's reclaiming of ownership of Blackacre, if the court holds Eve's interest to be FSSCS and that the condition has been broken by2Eve, The Estate of Dana would be required to exercise right of entry and power of termination to end Eve's interest in the land in order to reclaim the present interet. The estate would gain the current interest of blackacre in FSA once the right of and that the condition that the house not be attempted to sell may not apply. I do not think that will be the case because the language in the conveyance here points more towards a condition subsequent (or FSD). Eve can make additional claims to sell the property that will be addressed later on. In regard to Fiona's reclaiming of ownership of Blackacre, if the court holds Eve's interest to be FSSCS and that the condition has been broken by Eve, The Estate of Dana would be required to exercise right of entry and power of termination to end Eve's interest in the land in order to reclaim the present interet. The estate would gain the current interest of blackacre in FSA once the right of entry/power of termination was exercised. Fiona would then recieve the interest in Blackacre by being the sole divisee of the estate. If the court holds Eve's interest to be a FSD and finds that Eve's actions ended her current interest, by Dana's estate having the future interest of possibility of reverter, Blackacre would immediately go back to the estate of Dana in FSA. The holder of a possibility of reverter does not have to take any actions to regain title of the premise, once the FSD is broken the title automatically goes back to the grantor/future interest holder. Fiona would then recieve the title to blackacre by being the sole divisee as previously mentioned. In the case that the court doesnt hold the condition to have been broken, Fioana through her mother's estate can bring a claim of waste against Eve. A waste claim can be brought by a future interest holder against a current interest holder if the actions or inactions by the current interest holder affect the property in a positive and/or negative way. In this instance, Fioana, through the estate can bring a claim of permissive waste against Eve for her failure to maintain the property. By Eve practically abandoning blackacre and moving to florida for approximately 5 years, she allowed the property to become neglected and the home worsen significantly in condition. Eve likely commited permissive waste and has a duty, as the current interest holder, to the future interest holder to ensure the property is passed down in the same condition that it was recieved. Eve would likely be required to fix the condition of the home or pay damages to the future interest holder in order to rememdy the permissive waste claim. It could be argued that Eve committed affirmitive waste by abandoning the house and setting the real estate taxes to be auto-payed if the court finds that Eve's voluntarily hurt the value or condition of the home through her actions. Eve made the decision to abandon the premise and had knowledge that the house was not going to be taken care of when she left. In either case, Eve committed waste, either affirmitive or permissive, which affects the future interest holders interest in the property and will be required to pay damages or repair the property to restore it back to the way it previously was. Lastly, Eve can make a claim that the economic waste created by not selling the house is so great that it should be permitted. Economic waste occurs when a property is not being used to its full potential and has economic value that is not being taken advantage of. Eve can attempt to justify selling the property going to be taken care of when she left. In either case, Eve committed waste, either affirmitive or permissive, which affects the future interest holders interest in the property and will be required to pay damages or repair the property to restore it back to the way it previously was. Lastly, Eve can make a claim that the economic waste created by not selling the house is so great that it should be permitted. Economic waste occurs when a property is not being used to its full potential and has economic value that is not being taken advantage of. Eve can attempt to justify selling the property because of the econmic waste produced by not doing so but ultimately her argument will fail unless the courts decide that Eve holds blackacre in FSA. the reasoning behind this is a basic construct of property law and estates in that one can not convey more than their interest. Eve's interest is likely restricted by the ability to sell the property. Eve is able to practically do anything she wishes with the property, expect harm the future interest holder's interest, but she is not able to sell the property. Dana's estate should be able to exercise the power of termination or right of entry to end Eves interest, Fiona would recieve blackacre in FSA and she may do whatever she wants with the property, including sell the land. "," Peter, as a commercial tenant, will be able to make claims regarding partial/actual eviction, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, and constructive eviction (maybe). It is important to pay close attention to the language in the lease as that will help Peter determine what he may argue. The lease gives Peter; approximately 2000 square feet, common right of access, common use of the parking lot, and one designated parking spot. For the sake of clarity, common right of access and common use of the parking lot should be interpretted to give Peter and other tenants the same right of access or same right to the parking lot. Peter cannot be barred from using the rights of access or parking lot if other tenants are not also barred. In the Echo case, Echo tried to argue that their common right of access was taken away when the constuction project barred them and everyone else from using the normal door and required them to use a less convenient door to access the building. The court held that theright of access was still common because the other tenants were also requried to use the door to gain entry. This is relevant when discussing Peter's potential arguement against the common right of access because the construction project makes it very difficult to enter through the rear door. Peter uses the rear door for customers and pizza deliveries but because of the construction, the door is dificult and unpractical to use. Peter still has the front door of the pizza shop, facing Main St., to use for means of entry. The other tenants use their front door facing Main Street, and it was not noted in the facts as to the presence of a rear door the other tenants use for entry. Peter likely wont be able to argue against the access was still common because the other tenants were also requried to use the door to gain entry. This is relevant when discussing Peter's potential arguement against the common right of access because the construction project makes it very difficult to enter through the rear door. Peter uses the rear door for customers and pizza deliveries but because of the construction, the door is dificult and unpractical to use. Peter still has the front door of the pizza shop, facing Main St., to use for means of entry. The other tenants use their front door facing Main Street, and it was not noted in the facts as to the presence of a rear door the other tenants use for entry. Peter likely wont be able to argue against the common right of access because he shares a similar right of access (the front doors facing Main st.), while the rear door was convenient and helped business, restricting access or making the rear door difficult to enter through will not be a violation because the front door by itself is enough to satisfy the common right of access. The next claim Peter can attempt to assert can be one of a partial actual eviction. The claim arrises out of the encroachment by the construction equipment to Peter's designated parking spot. The equipment goes over the white line and into Peter's spot, which is apart of his lease. The encroachment is minor but it makes parking for Peter difficult and a tight sqeeze. While the encroachment is very minor, it does not matter for a partial actual eviction. In the case of a partial actual eviction, the tenant in essence has been evicted from the entire space. The tenant enters into a lease for a specificed amount of space, any encroachment onto that space violates their lease and in effect, evicts them from the entirety of the land. The case involving the shed that was built or extended in a way that it encroached on the tenants property (approximately 2ft) shows how a tenant can deal with minor actual encroachments. In the case, the court held that the encroachment constituted a actual physical eviction. It could be argued by Peter that his partial actual eviction from his designated parking spot is similar to that in the case just mentioned and kicks him out of the entire spot. Peter could then argue that his lease is violated by not having a designated parking spot. This is a weak arguement, but it can be made. The construction equipment can likely be moved a few inches to not encroach his parking spot or the landlord can give Peter a new designated parking spot. The lease is not specific as to the exact spot that is to be designated to Peter. Peter's primary arguement is that the construction by the landlord breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment and may be sufficient to constitute a constructive eviction. Peter will argue that the construction interfered with his enjoyment of the leased premise because of: the loud construction noise, the dust, the extended duration of the construction, and the accessibilty for customers. Peter's situation is very similar to the Echo case, where the tenant believed the construction interference with their enjoyment was sufficient for an eviction. Peter can argue that the constuction has made it very difficult for him to maintain the level of success achievable under normal conditions. Peter would be Peter's primary arguement is that the construction by the landlord breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment and may be sufficient to constitute a constructive eviction. Peter will argue that the construction interfered with his enjoyment of the leased premise because of: the loud construction noise, the dust, the extended duration of the construction, and the accessibilty for customers. Peter's situation is very similar to the Echo case, where the tenant believed the construction interference with their enjoyment was sufficient for an eviction. Peter can argue that the constuction has made it very difficult for him to maintain the level of success achievable under normal conditions. Peter would be able to easily prove this by showing the loss of business, the delayed deliveries because of construction, and the lack of customers now entering through the rear door. There is no reason to beleive Peter or the business are struggling for any reason other than the constant construction taking place. The conditions he has been put through would very likely be breaches of his queit enjoyment of the premise, but now we must figure out if the breaches rise to the level to constitute a constructive eviction. It is likely that the court will rule similar to the Echo case as the issues are similar as well as the cause of the issues. In the Echo case, it was ruled that the interference by the construction definetly breached the convenant of quiet enjoyment, but the court did not beleive it rose to the level to justify a constructive eviction. The court would likely hold the same to be true for Peter. He will likely be able to recover damages for the interferences over the course of the construction project but likely wont be able to abandon his lease through constructive eviction. In the case that Peter decides that he has had enough and wishes to assert a constructive eviction claim against Linda and abandon the premise, Peter would need to vacate the premise a reasonable amount of time after the interference has occurred. The facts are not specfic to the amount of time Peter has been dealing with the construction but it can be reasoned that it is likely for an amount of time greater than a reasonable time period. In the Reste Realty case, where the tenants were dealing with occasional flooding over the course of many months prior to moving out, the court held that the vacation of the premise was done in a reasonable matter of time from the 'crowning blow' incident. The crowning blow incident involved severe flooding that was worse than any time prior, shortly there after the tenants left. In order for Peter to satisfy the reasonable time to vacate the premise required of constructive eviction, I would advise him to wait for an incident to occur that is in a way his 'crowning blow' before vacating the premise. If he does so, his vacation of the premise will be similar to that in Reste and the court would similarly hold it to be reasonable enough for construtive eviction. If Peter decides to leave, and the court holds that the interfence caused by the construction was not sufficient to constitute a constructive eviction, Linda will likely argue that Peter has violated the 5 year lease and is liable to pay the remaining rent due. In order for Linda to attempt to claim damages for would advise him to wait for an incident to occur that is in a way his 'crowning blow' before vacating the premise. If he does so, his vacation of the premise will be similar to that in Reste and the court would similarly hold it to be reasonable enough for construtive eviction. If Peter decides to leave, and the court holds that the interfence caused by the construction was not sufficient to constitute a constructive eviction, Linda will likely argue that Peter has violated the 5 year lease and is liable to pay the remaining rent due. In order for Linda to attempt to claim damages for unpaid rent she has the burden of proving that she made a reasonable attempt to mitigate her own damages. The Landlord carries the burden in this situation because it would be extremely difficult for a tenant of an abandoned premise to prove that the landlord reasonably tried to mitigate their damages. This would include turning away any prospective tenants that would be interested in leasing the space even though it has been abandoned and the lease has not lapsed in time. Linda additionally will argue that her deduction of rent ($100 per month) was in recognition of the interferences Peter was dealing with. Linda likely will use the rent deduction to mitigate any damages for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment. There was no agreement by Peter to Linda that waived the covenant of quiet enjoyment or agreed to be given a reduced rent rate because of the construction work. The court may allow the rent deduction to mitigate the damages of breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment once the total damages have been totaled. ",1311,1729
e54ab8e3-11c0-46c6-9f44-12e3704a766a," The interests in Blackacre at the time of conveyance were the following: Dana conveyed the house to her cousin Eve on the condition that Eve does not sell the house. Fiona does not have a present or future interest because she was not named in the conveyance. This conveyance used both durational and conditional language, which would fulfill language requirements for Fee Simple Determinable (FSD) and Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS). FSD requires durational language and FSSCS requires conditional language. This makes it an ambiguous conveyance. This issue is similar to the Marenholz case where the conveyance was unclear whether the intent was to create a FSD or FSSCS. The court ultimately held that it was an FSD, but discussed favor of FSSCS because it allows for the grantor to decide whether or not to reclaim the property (right of entry/ power of termination). Because Dana was strongly opposed to the sale of the property, she would likely take back the property if it was an FSSCS conveyance and would automatically take back the property if it was an FSD. Had Dana specified a third party who would hold an executory interest and take the property in the case that Eve decided to sell it and violate the terms, the conveyance would have been classified as a Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitations. In many ways, this would have been more effective in protecting Dana's interest in avoiding sale of the property. During her lifetime, Dana would have either a possibility of reversion or right of entry if Eve decided to sell depending on the court's decision whether to classify as an FSD or FSSCS. Fiona, on the other hand, has no present interest at the time of conveyance, because she was not mentioned in the will. If Dana has some type of reversion and reclaims Blackacre if Eve tried to sell it during her lifetime, at the time of Dana's death Blackacre would go to her heirs, which would mean Fiona would inherit the property. Eve does not have a future interest, because the conveyance gave her Blackacre at that time not contingent upon a future event. The condition in the conveyance was specifically referring to a possible future event in which she decided to sell the property. Because of this, her interest would not be classified as a contingent remainder. time of Dana's death Blackacre would go to her heirs, which would mean Fiona would inherit the property. Eve does not have a future interest, because the conveyance gave her Blackacre at that time not contingent upon a future event. The condition in the conveyance was specifically referring to a possible future event in which she decided to sell the property. Because of this, her interest would not be classified as a contingent remainder. Eve could make the argument that she should be permitted to solicit offers on the house based on the fact that she is not using the house or the land with it. Eve says that she does cannot live on the land because she is distraught by Dana's death and the house carries memories of Dana. As a result, her move to Florida and decision to lock up the house mean that both the house and land are going unused at this time. While Dana did not want the property sold, she did not specify an alternate person to take the property should Eve decide not to live there. Because of this Blackacre is sitting unused. Eve could say that she should be allowed to sell it because policy rationales for land ownership say that land should be used. It should not be left underutilized because the present owner does not maximize it during their possession if there are other alternatives. Additionally, Dana is not alive to exercise her right to a reversion if Eve decides to sell. If she was alive to take back Blackacre, after her death Fiona as her heir would inherit it. But, there are no specified grantees with executory interest in the conveyance who would take the land if Eve decided to sell it. Therefore, there is no solution to this issue in the conveyance. This means that the court needs to interpret from the language, policies, and other cases what should be done with the property. This is similar to the White v. Brown which dealt with ambiguous conveyances. In that case there was an issue of whether or not the conveyance intended to give a life estate. The majority ruled that it was in fact an ambiguous conveyance and that it was not clearly a life estate. The descent and minority ruling claimed it was clearly a life estate. This required the court to look at intent and the statutes to make a decision. It seems that By not allowing the sale of the house, there could be an argument for economic waste does not maximize the use of the property. Eve's interest in selling is similar to Baker v. Weedon where the owner of the house wanted to sell for economic benefit. But, this instance differs because in the Baker case the court was interested in protecting future interests. In this case, there were no future interests to protect. The weakness in this argument is that the conveyance specifically says that she cannot sell the property. By not allowing the sale of the house, there could be an argument for economic waste does not maximize the use of the property. Eve's interest in selling is similar to Baker v. Weedon where the owner the house wanted to sell for economic benefit. But, this instance differs because in the Baker case the court was interested in protecting future interests. In this case, there were no future interests to protect. The weakness in this argument is that the conveyance specifically says that she cannot sell the property. As far as Fiona's basis for reclaiming ownership, Fiona might argue that she would have inherited the property if Dana was still alive and had a reversion which would be triggered by Eve's attempt to sell the property. This argument would have to favor Dana's intent to keep the property over her express conveyance of it to Eve without mention of executors or grantees, namely Fiona. Fiona says that she feels sentimental about Blackacre and wants to move back onto the property. This is similar to the Woodrick v. Wood case where the present owner wanted to tear down a barn on the propety, but a holder of a future interest did not want the barn torn down. It held sentimental value for her. Keeping the barn on the property detracted from its potential value, which can be classified as economic waste. As a result, the court did recognize the importance of looking beyond economic interests and gave the holder of the future interest damages to make up for the destruction of the barn. Fiona's sentimentality is also similar to the Ark Land Co. case where the court decided to look at more than economic interests when determining what to do with the propery. In this case, the company Ark Land Co. owned a substantial portion of a property. The rest of it belonged to a family that spread ownership throughout different members. Initially, the entire property belonged to the family, but some members sold their shares. In the case, Ark Land Co. petitioned for partition of sale of the property because they wanted to use the land for mining coal, an economic interest that would in many cases warrant the court to rule in their favor. However, the family members with interest in the property argued for a partition in kind because the land held sentimental value. The sentimental value, emotional attachment, and long length of time it was kept in the family persuaded the court to say that it is important to consider more than just economic value when determining whether to partition in sale or partition in kind. Additionally, this could be compared to the instance in Howard v. Kunto. Where Kunto's held actual possession of Howard's land because of a mix up with the deeds and were living on it for a length of time that allowed them to be considered adverse possessors to the court. Of course, Fiona is not an adverse possessor, but the court in Howard v. Kunto followed the policy rationale that the person with a stronger attachment to the land should have the right to it over someone who may only have constructive possession. Fiona, clearly is attached to the land if seeing it made her sentimental and since partition in kind. Additionally, this could be compared to the instance in Howard v. Kunto. Where Kunto's held actual possession of Howard's land because of a mix up with the deeds and were living on it for a length of time that allowed them to be considered adverse possessors to the court. Of course, Fiona is not an adverse possessor, but the court in Howard v. Kunto followed the policy rationale that the person with a stronger attachment to the land should have the right to it over someone who may only have constructive possession. Fiona, clearly is attached to the land if seeing it made her sentimental and since she revisited the property while remembering the passing of her mother five years before. If the court applies this policy rationale, Fiona is likely to have a greater chance of reclaiming ownership. Eve had an interest in benefitting economically from the sale of the property. She did not consider a sale until she received a call from a real estate developer who told her that they wanted to make an offer larger than what Eve would have expected. It is not stated that Eve was facing economic hardship that would cause a need for money from the sale of the home, but when given the opportunity to sell for a price higher than what she believed it was worth she decided to capitalize on the opportunity which the conveyance expressly stated she should not do. Following this logic, and that of the Ark Land Co. case, it seems reasonable to consider the sentimental value that Fiona would have with the property. This could prevent Eve from being allowed to sell and could help Fiona obtain ownership since selling would violate the conditions of the conveyance. Additionally, the statutory provisions from the New Suffolk General Laws state that ""Every grant or devise of real estate, or any interest therein, shall pass all the estate or interest of the grantor or devisor, unless the intent to pass a less estate or interest shall appear by express terms, or be necessarily implied in the terms of the instrument"". This provision could help Fiona's case. The intent of the passing of the estate or interest is relevant in this jurisdiction, it also does nto need to be specifically stated. In this instance, Fiona inherited all of Eve's personal property. This would demonstrate an intention by Dana to convey her important property to her daughter, Fiona, which could extend to the house. This argument could be made because Dana specifically stated in the conveyance that she did not want the house to be sold. It could be inferred, based on her seemingly good relationship with her daughter, that she would want the house to go to her daughter if it meant that it would not be sold. The express intent of her interest in keeping the house in the family and the implied intent based on her passing her personal property to her daughter may hold in court if the court is looking to relevant statutes when determing whether or not Fiona can reclaim the property. Fiona could argue that Eve should be held accountable for the repairs. Fiona stated that the house was the house to be sold. It could be inferred, based on her seemingly good relationship with her daughter, that she would want the house to go to her daughter if it meant that it would not be sold. The express intent of her interest in keeping the house in the family and the implied intent based on her passing her personal property to her daughter may hold in court if the court is looking to relevant statutes when determing whether or not Fiona can reclaim the property. Fiona could argue that Eve should be held accountable for the repairs. Fiona stated that the house was missing roof shingles, the glass was cracked, and there were other serious problems that had Eve, or someone else, been on the property they would have seen and hopefully repaired. As the owner, Eve has an obligation to maintain the property. By knowingly leaving the property vacant for five years, the court could say that this qualifies as waste, specifically permissive waste. Permissive waste is categorized by neglect. Ameliorative waste enhanches the property. The weakness in this argument is that the conveyance did not specify that she had to live on Blackacre only that she would not sell it. By paying taxes she maintains possession of the property even if she did not revisit it reguarly to maintain its condition. Had Fiona been a tenant of Eve's on Blackacre, she could have argued that Eve did have an obligation to make repairs as a landlord as determined by the Hilder v. St. Peter case where the court said that landlord's have an obligation to make repairs and provide a safe and comfortable home. As a tenant, Blackacre in the condition that Fiona found it in would not be considered safe and comfortable. As a property owner, Eve does have a duty to maintain the property in order to avoid waste. If Fiona held a future interest in the property, she might have a better chance of winning the argument that Eve should pay for the renovations. The present owner of a property has an obligation to maintain the property that way when the future interest holders gain possession it is in a state similar to what it was at the time of conveyance. The Wood v. Woodrick case involved a barn that the present interest holder wanted to tear down, but the future interest holder objected to it for sentimental value. Because there was nothing wrong with the barn and the present interest holder tore it down anyway, this was a substantial change to the property. When the future interest holder obtained the property, it would not be in the same condition as it was at the time of conveyance. The court in this case looked to the future interest holder's interest in maintaining this portion of the property due to sentimental value and awarded damages. Similarly, Fiona may be able to receive damages to account for the destructions in the property caused by the neglect, or permissive waste, in order to make the necessary repairs. be in the same condition as it was at the time of conveyance. The court in this case looked to the future interest holder's interest in maintaining this portion of the property due to sentimental value and awarded damages. Similarly, Fiona may be able to receive damages to account for the destructions in the property caused by the neglect, or permissive waste, in order to make the necessary repairs. "," In this case, Peter may make the argument for constructive eviction due to breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. This states that the landlord cannot substantially interfere with the tenant's use of the property. This includes construction. This instance is similar to the Reste Realty case in which the tenant's property had a serious flooding issue that occurred after every storm and seemed to get worse over time. The tenant notified the landlord and the landlord promised to repair the driveway that was causing the water to enter the building. The landlord's promise to make the necessary repairs prompted Reste Realty to renew their lease. After a reasonable length of time no changes were made and eventually the flooding was so bad that it interfered with Reste Realty's business. It would have been economically detrimental to Reste Realty's business to stay. After vacating, the landlord wanted to sue for rent, but the court held that this fulfilled constructive eviction and that the tenant, Reste Realty, could leave without obligation to pay rent. A landlord has a duty to make repairs to a building. Under the modern rule, a tenant is neither obligated nor expected to make repairs to the property. The landlord also has a greater knowledge and is in a better financial situation. To allow the landlord to continue to either not make necessary repairs or to substantially interefere with the tenant's business would not be fair. The court is likely to apply similar reasoning as the Reste Realty case to Peter's situation. The landlord had notice, there was substantial interference, and no changes were made in a reasonable amount of time. If Peter vacated at this point, the court would likely not hold him liable for the remaining rent despite the fact that he renewed the lease in good faith that the landlord would make the necessary changes to stop the construction that was impacting Peter's business so substantially. Linda could argue that as a landlord, she is obligated to make repairs to the building. Therefore, it The court is likely to apply similar reasoning as the Reste Realty case to Peter's situation. The landlord had notice, there was substantial interference, and no changes were made in a reasonable amount of time. If Peter vacated at this point, the court would likely not hold him liable for the remaining rent despite the fact that he renewed the lease in good faith that the landlord would make the necessary changes to stop the construction that was impacting Peter's business so substantially. Linda could argue that as a landlord, she is obligated to make repairs to the building. Therefore, it should not be an issue that there was construction in order to repair parts of the exterior of the building. These repairs likely increased safety and improved the appearance of the building both of which would benefit the tenant's business. But by not completing the repairs in a reasonable length of time, one week as promised, the ongoing construction violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The covenant of quiet enjoyment states that the landlord cannot substantially interefere with the tenant's tenancy. The scaffolding that blocks the rear door where Peter and his staff are able to make quicker deliveries because of the ease of access. Peter says that this intereferes with his business. This argument that he is entitled to use of the door is similar to the Echo case. In the echo case, the bank was in the middle of renovations and those renovations caused limited access to the back parking lot and backdoor. Because of this employees had to park in the front and use the front door. Policy changes in the building caused the front door to be locked after hours after these renovations began. Echo argued constructive eviction because they believed that the landlord was substantially interfering. The court found that this was not constructive eviction because the language in the lease stated that there was common access and use of the doors and parking lots. It did not specifically say that the tenant was entitled to use of the rear door. In addition, the renovations were not permanent so this was not a long-term issue. All of which could not be categorized as constructive eviction. Similarly, in Peter's case, Linda could say that it is specifically mentioned in the lease that he has a ""common right of access thereto, a common use of the parking lot"". This means that there was no specification that he was entitled to use of the back door at all times if he could also enter through the front. The facts also state that a person can navigate through the maze of scaffolding and customers had done it before. This means that while it was not necessarily easily accessible, Peter and his staff and customers were not entirely barred access to that doorway. Following that logic, as applied in the Echo case, the court will likely find that this is not constructive eviction. This does not apply to this case specifically because Echo experienced no detriment to their business just an inconvenience. While Peter of the pizza shop as a result of this ongoing stated that there was a notable decrease in the revenue construction. done it before. This means that while it was not necessarily easily accessible, Peter and his staff and customers were not entirely barred access to that doorway. Following that logic, as applied in the Echo case, the court will likely find that this is not constructive eviction. This does not apply to this case specifically because Echo experienced no detriment to their business just an inconvenience. While Peter stated that there was a notable decrease in the revenue of the pizza shop as a result of this ongoing construction. Peter can argue that he also entitled to a designated parking spot, according to the lease. But he says that the construction equipment encroaches upon his space. He can still park but it is more difficult. Again, this would tie to the door situation above, Linda could say that he is not being prevented from use entirely. The encroachment issue is reminiscent of the case with the wagon and shed where the landlord built a structure that encroached upon the property of the tenant. This was considered partial eviction because as a paying tenant, the tenant should be in possession of all of the designated area. The court ruled that the tenant would not be obligated to pay rent because part of their space was taken knowingly by the landlord. This case resulted in damages to make up for the lost space. This case does not seem to apply here because the landlord has not put up a permanent structure. The construction equipment is touching his space, but it will be moved at the end of the construction and he does still have access to his parking space. Additionally, Linda, the landlord, after hearing Peter's concern says that she will deduct $100 from his monthly rent to make up for the hassle. This aligns with court's ruling of the entitlement of damages if the tenant does not have access to the entire property. The covenant of quiet enjoyment does specify that the landlord cannot substantially interefere with the tenant's use of the property. Linda had told Peter that the contractor said the project would take a week or so. Because the repairs went on longer than expected and had a negative impact on the revenue of the pizza shop, this could qualify as substantial interference. In addition, the landlord knows of the issue because she both acknowledged it and Peter brought it up, but she does not make the necessary changes in a reasonable amount of time to stop the interfering project. He could argue constructive eviction in this case and would likely be able to break his lease without obligation to pay rent. Therefore, Peter is likely able to break his lease despite the renewal at the beginning of January. ",2558,1336
d2a0868b-f1ef-43d6-a277-0b4b33bd78d0," Interests Created by Dana's Conveyance Dana's conveyance created a present interest for Eve which is a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS). FSSCS is accompanied by future interests in the grantor which is power of termination/right of entry. The conveyance is ambiguous because it includes both durational and conditional language. The use of ""so long as"" would qualify the conveyance to be a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD) which is created using durational language in the conveyance. The use of ""provided that"" qualifies the conveyance to be a FSSCS. However, the rules of construction urges the court to favor FSSCS over FSD. Therefore in the event that an action is filed for the court to interpret this conveyance it will likely rule the conveyance to be a FSSCS over FSD. This is similar to the court's decision from the School District case where the conveyance language was similarly ambiguous and the court had to decide whether the conveyance was a FSSCS or FSD. The court followed the rules of construction and decided the conveyance was a FSSCS. Dana's conveyance is a FSSCS because of the rules of construction which favors a FSSCS over FSD in the event that the conveyance is ambiguous. When Dana died, her will then transferred her future interest to her daughter, Fiona. Since the future interest is no longer in the grantor but in a third party (Fiona), the future interest becomes an Executory Interest in Fee Simple Absolute. Hence, in the event that Eve violates the conditions of her interest, Fiona will step in and own Blackacre in Fee Simple Absolute (FSA). In this case, should Eve attempt to sell the house, which is the condition at stake, Fiona will then cut Eve's interest in the house short and take ownership in FSA. Eve Selling Property Should Eve want to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre, she might have options. Dana's conveyance definitely bans her from selling the house and in the event that she attempts to, Fiona's Executory interest will cut Eve's off. The only avenues Eve has are getting Fiona to agree to either a partition in sale or partition in kind. Eve will need Fiona's consent because Fiona has a future interest in Eve Selling Property Should Eve want to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre, she might have options. Dana's conveyance definitely bans her from selling the house and in the event that she attempts to, Fiona's Executory interest will cut Eve's off. The only avenues Eve has are getting Fiona to agree to either a partition in sale or partition in kind. Eve will need Fiona's consent because Fiona has a future interest in the property and just like in the Arkland case where the court decided based on both the present and future interest parties, here Eve and Fiona would both have to agree to either a partition to sale or a partition in kind. A partition in sale would permit Eve to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre, sell to the highest bidder and share the sale amount with Fiona. A partition in kind however will be unlikely here because the property is a house and may be difficult to divide but a court can explore futher options under this. Regardless of whether it ends up being a partition in kind or in sale, the most important factor is getting Fiona to agree because in the event that Fiona does not agree and Eve attempts to sell the house, Fiona will take over Blackacre with her Executory interest which at tha point will be an ownership in FSA. If Eve attempts to sell Blackacre without Fiona's consent, Fiona then has basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre. The conveyance was a FSSCS witht the condition that Eve does not attempt to sell the house. Dana's future interest was transferred to Fiona in her will. Hence, the only basis Fiona has for reclaiming ownership is if Eve goes forward with soliciting offers for the sale of Blackacre without Fiona's consent for a partition in sale. If Fiona and Eve however agree to a partition in sale, Fiona loses her future interest to claim ownership of Blackacre. Therefore if Fiona wishes to keep her future interest in Blackacre, she can either not join Eve in a request for a partition in sale, should Eve suggest such or Fiona can agree to a partition in sale and pose as the highest bidder, hereby owning Blackacre in FSA. Since Fiona plans to move back to Blackacre, she will likely not agree to a partition in sale or in kind, hence, should Eve go forward with soliciting offers, Fiona will take over. Fiona Holding Eve Accountable for Damages Fiona has a future interest in Blackacre, therefore should be concerned about its conditions and whether Eve is properly taking care of the house. A future interest holder can sue for damages or require the present interest holder to repair damages which occur while the present interest holder still has possession of property. In this case, though Eve put the real estate taxes on auto-pay so she would not miss any payments, there is still permissive waste here which is essentially voluntary or willful neglect to the property. Here, the roof shingles are missing, the glass is cracked, there are other serious problems Fiona has a future interest in Blackacre, therefore should be concerned about its conditions and whether Eve is properly taking care of the house. A future interest holder can sue for damages or require the present interest holder to repair damages which occur while the present interest holder still has possession of property. In this case, though Eve put the real estate taxes on auto-pay so she would not miss any payments, there is still permissive waste here which is essentially voluntary or willful neglect to the property. Here, the roof shingles are missing, the glass is cracked, there are other serious problems which are evident that the house has not fared well in the cold. It is Eve's duty as the present possessory holder in Blackacre to take care of the house and not commit either economic, ameliorative, affirmative or permissive waste in Blackacre. On the basis that Eve had such duty, Fiona can file an action to hold Eve accountable for the damages. Eve may argue that she could not have maintained the house because she was away, which is a valid argument, however, she would be liable to fix the damages because she was and still in the present possesory holder in Black acre. "," Peter v. Linda Linda and Peter seemed to have a good Tenant and Landlord relationship until Linda begins to make repairs on the exterior of the building which Peter has common right of access to per the terms stated on his lease. The repairs have gone beyond the time expected and are causing problems for Peter, hence he wants to leave but is concerned about his newly signed 5 years lease. Peter has two main options, he can either choose to leave and not pay rent or stay and claim damages or not pay rent till the construction is over. A Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment is a promise in every lease by the landlord to provide premises mentioned in lease to tenant without any interferance. Any off such interferance assumes a breach of the covenant. Peter's first option is to file a LL breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment(CQE) against Linda. A landlord's substantial interference with tenant's enjoyment of premises leased is a breach of CQE. Similar to the Smith v. McEnany case where the landlord built a wall/minor encroachment on tenant's leased premises and the court ruled that because the tenant paid rent for use of all premises promised in lease, the wall/minor encroachment, interferred with the tenant's enjoyment of entire premises paid for. Here, the contractor built scaffolding all across the rear of the building, which largely blocks access to the rear door and the construction equipment encroaches a little on Peter's designated covenant. Peter's first option is to file a LL breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment(CQE) against Linda. A landlord's substantial interference with tenant's enjoyment of premises leased is a breach of CQE. Similar to the Smith v. McEnany case where the landlord built a wall/minor encroachment on tenant's leased premises and the court ruled that because the tenant paid rent for use of all premises promised in lease, the wall/minor encroachment, interferred with the tenant's enjoyment of entire premises paid for. Here, the contractor built scaffolding all across the rear of the building, which largely blocks access to the rear door and the construction equipment encroaches a little on Peter's designated parking spot. Peter's lease provides him with ""common right of access, a common use of the parking lot, and one designated parking spot"". Just like in the Smith case, Peter was promised terms on the lease which are now being violated. He is not getting access to everything he was promised or is paying for which is not fair and hence, there is no need to wait for Linda to evict him, he can choose to leave. Should Peter leave due to the conditions created by Linda, it will be a Constructive Eviction, which will be valid because constructive eviction requires tenant to inform landlord of issues at hand, give the landlord reasonable time for repairs and upon failure to do so, tenant may abandon premises in reasonable time . Similar to the Reste flooding case where the landlord's agent promised to make repairs to the building but failed to do so within reasonable time and the tenant abandoned premises hence breaking their lease after a crowning blow of the building flooding. The court held that the tenant was in the right because they notified the Landlord, recieved a promise from the landlord's agent promising to make repairs, allowed reasonable time and therefore they had a claim to damages and were not liable for rent post them abandoning the premises. Here, Peter experienced such an experience and crowning blow. When Peter was informed about the one-week repairs to be made, he actually closed his pizza shop for a week and went on vacation, expecting the repairs to be completed upon his return. Unfortunately that was not the case and now he has fewer customers because beforehand, customers could park in the lot and use the exterior entrance for easy access to the pizza shop but the construction has blocked that entrance. The Pizza shop could use the exterior entrance for pizza deliveries quickly because the delivery-person can pull a car right up to the back door, but now, it is difficult to use the back door for pizza deliveries because it is nearly impossible to bring a car close to the rear door. Peter has notified Linda about his concerns and the repairs have since been going on for months, which has allowed Linda reasonable time to repair. The crowing blow is Peter's revenues from the pizza shop being down. He can successfully abandon the shop and will not be subject to pay rent because he has been partially evicted from his shop per the terms on lease. Linda might argue that there was a contract reformation when she offerred to deduct $100 from Peter's 7 monthly rent, however the construction is having more of a financial effect on Peter than a $100. He is losing customers and his revenues are down!. has notified Linda about his concerns and the repairs have since been going on for months, which has allowed Linda reasonable time to repair.

Linda might argue that there was a contract reformation when she offerred to deduct $100 from Peter's monthly rent, however the construction is having more of a financial effect on Peter than a $100. He is losing customers and his revenues are down!. A breach of CQE requires that the landlord have interrupted the tenant's enjoyment of leased premises. This case is very similar in facts to the Echo v. Norway Bank case where there was an ongoing construction on the ground foor which produced noise that disturbed the tenant's, Echo had been promised access to in the lease, coupled with not having entrance to the parking lot and a door which was locked hence preventing entrance. The court ruled that Norway Bank had breached the CQE. Similarly here, the construction created a noisy environment and Peter also has to keep the windows closed because of the dust. These are all conditions which go against Peter's expectations when the lease was signed, they are not fair to him, it is considered Constructive Eviction and should he abandon the building, will not be liable to pay rent for length of his lease because Linda's repairs where substantially interferring with his enjoyment of the space he leased. Another option Peter has, though not the best option, will be to stay and file for damages that Linda's construction have caused him. In the Echo case, the tenants stayed in the building and filed for damages. This would not be the best option for Peter because he has already lost customers and revenues, hence is future at the same location is not looking so promising and Linda is unsure about how much longer the repairs will take. If Peter chooses to stay, he can file to get money for the revenue he has lost due to the construction. Peter can also stay and withhold his rent until the construction is over in which case I would advise him to keep the rent aside in escrow, should he later be liable for rent payment. Linda has a duty to mitigate the damages of Peter abandoning the premises by re-letting the premises. In the Sommer case, the tenant paid their first and last deposit but later sent a letter informing the landlord about his intent to abandon the property, the landlord however reluctantly refused a possible tenant of leasing the apartment and later attempted to claim damages and rent from the original tenant. The court reasoned that the landlord had the burden to prove he attempted to re-let the apartment but to no avail because the landlord had a duty to mitigate damages 7 re-letting the apartment following the original by tenant's abandonment. Here, should Peter decide to leave his pizza shop, Linda will have a duty to mitigate damages by re-letting the premises to a new tenant. the Sommer case, the tenant paid their first and last deposit but later sent a letter informing the landlord about his intent to abandon the property, the landlord however reluctantly refused a possible tenant of leasing the apartment and later attempted to claim damages and rent from the original tenant.

6da920da-5544-4256-a6dc-cdb3b418ba72," Essay 1 Interests Created by the original conveyance, why? Dana's conveyance gives present possessory interest of Blackacre to Eve, allowing her to live on the property ""provided that"" and ""only so long as"" she does not sell or attempt to sell Blackacre. The conveyance also seems to indicate a future interest in the grantor (Dana) that is until she dies, otherwise, it would likely be viewed as a future interest in a grantee which would create a Fee Simple Subject to Executory (FSSEL). Dana conveys what seems to be a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD) due to the durational language ""so long as"" or a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent FSSCS due to the condition that ""she does not attempt to sell the house"". Although initially FSSEL seems like an option, the conveyance does not specify a third party future executory intererst, even though one might consider Dana's daughter, Fiona, to hold an executory interest in Blackacre in FSA since she inherits all of her personal property. The Mahrenholz case lends similarities to this situation as the conveyance is ambiguous as to whether there will be a possibility of reverter or a right of re-entry power of termination. In Marenholz as the court held that the conveyance language adhered more to the FSD, it seems here that Dana's conveyance would need to be evaluated on the intention of Dana. Also similar to the case at hand, the White v. Brown case, in which Mrs. White specified in her will that her house was ""not to be sold"". In the White case, the court favored the Intent of the grantor over the actual language of the conveyance. Here intent of the grantor (Dana) is extremely importance in assessing the meaning behind the conveyance because of its ambiguity. Because this conveyance can be considered ambiguous, a court will likely consider the rules of construction necessary to deal with ambiguous conveyances. For example, achieve the intent of the grantor (Dana), favor complete over partial intestacies, favor Fee Simple Subject to a Condition Subsequent (FSSCS) (Due to the policy rationale that the owner should be paying attention to their land, i.e. to re enter and re-take if the condition subseqent is met, and that the land should be used by the person occupying it in a productive manor), over Fee Simple Determinable (FSD), favor a FSA. Because Dana conveys to Eve what seems to be a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD) which would mean Because this conveyance can be considered ambiguous, a court will likely consider the rules of construction necessary to deal with ambiguous conveyances. For example, achieve the intent of the grantor (Dana), favor complete over partial intestacies, favor Fee Simple Subject to a Condition Subsequent (FSSCS) (Due to the policy rationale that the owner should be paying attention to their land, i.e. to re enter and re-take if the condition subseqent is met, and that the land should be used by the person occupying it in a productive manor), over Fee Simple Determinable (FSD), favor a FSA. Because Dana conveys to Eve what seems to be a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD) which would mean that the future interest is a reversion that would go to the grantor (Dana) if she is still alive, or Fiona (who inherits all of Eve's personal property after she dies) or escheat to the state. The conveyance is in Fee Simple so the duration is potentially unlimmited, however, since it is subject to the condition that Eve not sell or ""attempt"" to sell the property, it is subject to divestment/defeasance if the condition subsequent is met. Eve Arguments for soliciting offers for the sale Eve could argue that not allowing her to solicit offers would be economic waste since she is not using the property and Blackacre is arguably not being used it is most useful capacity. This is similar to the Arkland case where economic waste was committed when the land was not being used in its most productive capacity. Another strength to Eves argument would be ameliorative waste as was seen in the Baker Case because of the improved value of the land based on its location, she would be committing ameliorative waste if she is not allowed to solicit offers while the value of the property is high (based on the ""staggering offer"" made by the real estate agent). Also considered is the necessity of the sale of the property as in the Baker case. As in the Woodrick v. Wood case where the selling of the land would benefit to all parties, Here it seems Eve has an argument based on the Wood case that the selling of the property would be necessary to the benefit of all parties based on the appreciation in value of the property. Weaknessess to this argument As the Arkland case was discussed in an argument above, it can also be considered a weakness for Eve because the court did not only rely on economic waste in their decision. In fact the court held that the emotional sentiment, and ties to the property that the other future interest holders have must also be considered. Here, because Fiona has serious emotional ties to the land, growing up there and it being her late mothers old property, she has significant emotional ties to the land and a court as in the Arkland Weaknessess to this argument As the Arkland case was discussed in an argument above, it can also be considered a weakness for Eve because the court did not only rely on economic waste in their decision. In fact the court held that the emotional sentiment, and ties to the property that the other future interest holders have must also be considered. Here, because Fiona has serious emotional ties to the land, growing up there and it being her late mothers old property, she has significant emotional ties to the land and a court as in the Arkland case would be reluctant to permit the sale of the property. Because it is not sale of the property that violates the lease but mere attempt to sell, this scenario is slightly different than the Baker case; however, a court can still use the Baker precedent as the cases are similar on the basis that the present possessors sitting on Blackacre are looking to potentially sell the property for profit. As in the Baker case, a court will likely attribute a weakness to Eves argument in that the sale is not neccessary and beneficial to all of the interest holders. Aditionally, because the conveyance language says ""does not attempt to sell"" this indicates that even soliciting offers would violate the conveyance. By merely attempting to sell the property Eve is in violation of the conveyance and if this were in fact a FSD the property would automatically revert back to the grantor (since she is not alive it would go to her issue or potentially escheat to the state under common law). This can be considered a weakness in that if the conveyance is violated she does not have any further authority of the the interests of the property. Another weakness is that when Eve left the property after Dana died, but continued paying taxes as it was still her property, she neglected to maintain the property according to the law of waste and her duty to leave the property unchanged. This is considered Permissive waste of the property. By allowing the property to deteriorate in the wintertime, Eve was effectively sleeping on her rights as an owner and neglecting to maintain the property. Another issue with this is that there is potential for an adverse possessor to come in and begin adverse possession so a policy rationale for avoiding this kind of waste is that property holders have a duty to exhert reasonable care and not sleep on their rights of the property, otherwise the rights will be taken away by the adverse possessor who is more effectively using the property. The doctrine of waste can also be applied here. Fiona Basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre As ""issue"" of her mother Dana, Fiona has a first distribution right to the property based on the statutory provisions in the New Suffolk General Laws because Dana did not explicitly provide the distribution of the property. The doctrine of waste can also be applied here. Fiona Basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre As ""issue"" of her mother Dana, Fiona has a first distribution right to the property based on the statutory provisions in the New Suffolk General Laws because Dana did not explicitly provide the distribution of Blackacre in her will. Because Dana merely provided that Fiona is to inherit all of her personal property in her will but did not specify Blackacre specifically (maybe because she intended for her conveyance to be in FSA to Eve) this strengthens Fiona's argument that she has a legal basis to reclaim Blackacre due to the statutory provision. Considering the Arkland case again and its similarities to the present case, sentimental and emotional ties to the disputed property are considered and not just the economic benefit of the sale. This strengthens Fiona's argument to reclaim ownership of blackacre due to her emotional and sentimental ties having grown up on the property and it being her late mother's property. Despite the economic benefit selling the property may have to both parties, based on the Arkland case it is likely that Eve will have stronger ties to the property and a stronger argument for reclaiming it. Fiona seems to have a strong legal basis to recover Blackacre that outweighs any interest Eve holds in the property. Tenancy in Common? Holding Eve accountable for repairs Fiona can hold Eve accountable for repairs of the property on the basis that she is in violation of the law of waste. Because Eve neglected the property, she committed permissive waste. Because Eve did not hire anyone to care for the property in her absence (though she continued to pay taxes) a court might consider this affirmative waste and more than negligence because a reasonable person would expect that a property requires regular maintainence. Futher, the law of waste says the property is to remain unchanged, specifically to protect the future interest holders rights to recieve the property the grantor intended. Here, Eve did not leave the property unchanged through her permissive and affirmative waste. Fiona seems to have a strong basis for holding Eve accountable for repairs based on Eve's waste of the property. Weaknessess to Fiona holding Eve accountable to the repairs can be that Eve is not required to repair the property because it was not actually hers to begin with. The conveyance was ambiguous and if the statute holds stronger than the conveyance, a court may decide that Fiona had the ultimate present possessory rights to the property in FSA and she is not entitled to any compensation from Eve for the repairs on Blackacre. property.

"," Essay 2 Peter Legal Rights and Options Peter has a term of years lease for his Pizza place in Linda's commercial building. The Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (CQE) is implied in the lease and prevents interference of the lessees quiet enjoyment by the landlord (i.e. the landlord cannot interfere with the tenants enjoyment/use of the property). When this implied covenant is breached there are certain rights a tenant is entitled to invoke such as witholding rent. Scope of CQE is broader than the Implied warranty of Habitibility (which applies only to residential). This case is similar to the NH Bank case, for example, based on the provisions in the NH Case lease where ""common right of access"" thereto. Also similar to the Bank case, the construction in the bank case prevented the lessees from using the property in the manner in which it was rented for because the construction of the building rendered the areas of access (usual entrance) unaccessible and required employees to use a different entrance. This is simiar to this case where the scaffolding is hindering the ability for customers to access the shop and delivery workers to make timely deliveries. Unlike the NH Bank case, where the court held there was not a significant breach of the Covenant of Quiet enjoyment because the tenants still had access despite the construction and the interferance was temporary (i.e. noise temporary), here the interference by the landlords persistant construction though temporary is still significantly interfering with the tenants uniterrupted use of the property rendering some of the property unusable. The construction is inhibiting the customers access the pizza place and hindering the employees ability to deliver on time which has and inturn caused Peter's revenues to be down. Because ability for customers to access the shop and delivery workers to make timely deliveries. Unlike the NH Bank case, where the court held there was not a significant breach of the Covenant of Quiet enjoyment because the tenants still had access despite the construction and the interferance was temporary (i.e. noise temporary), here the interference by the landlords persistant construction though temporary is still significantly interfering with the tenants uniterrupted use of the property rendering some of the property unusable. The construction is inhibiting the customers access the pizza place and hindering the employees ability to deliver on time which has and inturn caused Peter's revenues to be down. Because the construction by the landlord is seemingly breaching Peter's implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, he likely has a strong argument to recover on this basis. However, if the court rules as they did in the Bank case, Peter may not be able to recover if they decide that the interference is considered temporary and did not prevent the use of the rented premises for the purpose in which it was rented. This is also similar to the Echo case where the lessor's faliure to fix the flooding issues infringing on the lessee's covenant of quiet enjoyment because here, the Landlord (LL) is also failing to fix the persistant issues with the construction. This case is also like the Echo case because as the continuous flooding prevented use of the rented basement, the continuous construction is largely blocking access to the rear door and preventing use of the property that is provided for in the lease. As it was nearly impossible to use the basement during flooding, aside from storage (only if the boxes were stacked high and away from the flooding), the scaffolding in this case is preventing the timely delivery of pizzas and preventing customers from entering. As the court ruled in the echo case, the prevention of the use of the property for which it was rented allows the tenant to recover. The Reste Realty case replaced caveat lessee which means ""buyer beware"" for the modern approach that it is the landlord's responsibility to fix issues that breach interfere with the tenants use and enjoyment and breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment. As the lease renewed with the same terms in the Echo case, the lease in this case also renewed under the same terms. As the court held in Echo the landlord is responsible for upholding the same terms of the prior lease reguardless of changed circumstances (i.e. new flooding). Also at issue is the encroachment on Peter's parking spot that he is entitled to via the lease. Based on the Smith case and smith rule, Partial eviction is eviction from all. Though one could argue that the encroachment is minor thus weakening Peter's claim, it is likely that the Smith rule will allow him to recover. As the landlord's wall that encroached on the tenants property only 15 inches, the minor encroachment on Peter's parking spot is will also be considered 9 partial eviction and constructively eviction from the whole. Although the parking spot is not the building itself in which the Pizza shop is located, it is still within the lease. Futhermore like in the smith case the wall that encroached was built Also at issue is the encroachment on Peter's parking spot that he is entitled to via the lease. Based on the Smith case and smith rule, Partial eviction is eviction from all.

Although the parking spot is not the building itself in which the Pizza shop is located, it is still within the lease. Futhermore like in the smith case the wall that encroached was built outside which also strengthens Peter's argument for recovery. Also at issue is the timing of the landlords construction. Based on her initial estimate, the repairs were only supposed to take a week, however, they have been extended far beyond that. A court may consider this not making repairs in a reasonable amount of time even though not directly related to the Implied Warranty of Habitability because that exists for residential leases. Either way, the prevention of Peter from using the property for the purpose in which it was rented for is a strong argument for him to legally withold rent while the covenant is breached. Because Linda the landlord says she will deduct $100 from the rent, she seems to be making reasonable efforts to resolve the issue which would weaken Peter's claim to recover. Tenant and landlord rights and duties are the basis for assement of whether or not Peter is responsible for paying the rest of his 5 year lease. The landlord has a duty to provide possession of the property however in this case, the landlord is not providing possession as Peter cannot effectively use the property in the manner it was leased for. Futher, the landlord has a duty to uphold the covenant of quiet enjoyment which is likely being violated here. Because Peter is likely constructively evicted from the entire property, he will likely not be required to pay rent for the remainder of the lease. On the otherhand, if the court rules as they did in Echo then he may not be able to recover. Similar cases that deal with this issue are the Reste Realty case, White v. Brown case, and the Berg v. Wiley (LL/T restaurant case - no self help). Had this not been a pizza shop the dust interference requiring Peter to shut his windows may invoke the implied warranty of habitibility as this would likely threaten the safety of the tenants. Although to prove IWH the tenant must show a breach of housing laws and show that the landlord did not fix the issue in a reasonable amount of time. Although Peter renewed his lease, due to the aformentioned reasons and precedent cases in his favor as well as the landlords duties, he will likely not be responsible for the 5 months of rent. Typically, especially in MA tenants are favored over landlords which 9 would help Peter in this situation as he is already in a more advantagous position than Linda the Landlord. of the tenants.

ecdebb90-4db9-4967-b6f9-ea3759679fcc," Essay 1: Dana's conveyance and why: Dana conveyed the land to her cousin provided that and only so long as her cousin does not attempt to sell the house. The language Dana used, ""provided that"" seems conditional, and her use of ""only so long as"" seems durational and limitational. Due to the use of conditional language in the conveyance, basing the conveyance on the condition that Eve does not attempt to sell the house, we can determine that Dana's conveyance to Eve was a Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation (FSSEL), due to the use of both conditional and limitational language, where a third party holds a future interest. But in this conveyance, there is no third party named. However, in a statutory provision from New Suffolk General Laws, it states that ""if a property of a deceased person is not distributed accoring to their will, it shall be first distributed to their issue, then ancestors, then collatterals."" By using this law, we can infer that if Eve was to break the condition and limitation, the property would go to her issue, which means her daughter, executory interest holder, Fiona, in fee simple absolute. So, the third party interest in Dana's FSSEL conveyance of Blackacre would be held by Fiona if Eve was to attempt to sell the land. Attempt may be hard to prove, since it is not a definite act. But, we can infer that if Eve was to take a substantial step to sell the land, and if the land was to be sold but for something interfering Eve's actions to sell, that would be sufficient to satisfy attempt and violate the condition and limitation of the conveyance. it can also be argued that Eve has a Fee Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS) due to her conditional language. In this case, Dana would have the power of termination or right of re-entry if the condition was to be violated. After Dana's death, that future interest would pass to her issue, Fiona, following New Suffolk General Laws. But FSSEL is more likely to be the proper conveyance due to the use of both conditional and durational language. Under the Rules of Construction, the courts try to avoid partial intestacies. We are told that according to Dana's will, her daughter Fiona got all of her personal property. Using the Rules of Contruction and taking into consideration that part of Dana's property went to her daughter, we can infer that the court will favor giving Fiona, Dana's issue, the right to Blackacre provided that the condition of attempting to sell the land was violated. following New Suffolk General Laws. But FSSEL is more likely to be the proper conveyance due to the use of both conditional and durational language. Under the Rules of Construction, the courts try to avoid partial intestacies. We are told that according to Dana's will, her daughter Fiona got all of her personal property. Using the Rules of Contruction and taking into consideration that part of Dana's property went to her daughter, we can infer that the court will favor giving Fiona, Dana's issue, the right to Blackacre provided that the condition of attempting to sell the land was violated. Eve permitted to solicit offers: Eve does not seem to have an ability to solicit offers to sell the land because in Dana's original conveyance, she conveyed the land to Eve ""provided that"" and ""only so long as"" Eve does not attempt to sell the house. Dana then repeats, ""The house is not to be sold."" This language in the conveyance is extremely similar to the White v. Brown case where a lady conveyed her interest in her home to her sister-in-law and neice and repeated that her house is to not be sold. The case at hand slightly varies in that the language is more clear that there is a condition that the house is to not be sold, where as in White v. Brown, the conveyance was slightly ambiguous and the courts disputed over whether or not the deed had conditional language or resulted in a fee simple absolute. If Eve was to solicit offers on the sale of Blackacre, that would be violating the condition. Eve can argue, however, that keeping the land would be a waste. There are several arguments of waste that Eve can raise to justify her selling or soliciting offers to sell the land. It would be hard to argue affirmative waste, because that would mean that the resident purposefully destroyed the property. In our scenario, there was no one residing in the house that caused the destruction. However, a strong claim can be made in regards to permissive waste, because permissive waste requires the neglect of a party to the property, causing damage. Permissive waste can be applied here. After five years of being away from the land, Eve and Fiona come back to commemmerate the five-year anniversary of Dana's passing. They come back to find the house has not done well in the New Suffolk cold. Due to the neglect of upkeep for the past five years, the roof is missing shingles, the glass is cracked, and there are other very serious problems. Eve can also argue ameliorative waste. This type of waste has to do with raising the value of the property. This type of waste is not usually applied to present day situations anymore, so the courts will most likely avoid applying this type of waste to this situation. A strong argument Eve has is that keeping the property will result in economic waste. The house is in a prime location in New Suffolk and has appreciated in value. By selling the house, Eve will receive a substantial amount of money due to the serious problems. Eve can also argue ameliorative waste. This type of waste has to do with raising the value of the property. This type of waste is not usually applied to present day situations anymore, so the courts will most likely avoid applying this type of waste to this situation. A strong argument Eve has is that keeping the property will result in economic waste. The house is in a prime location in New Suffolk and has appreciated in value. By selling the house, Eve will receive a substantial amount of money due to the increase in property worth. One case that is similar to such would be the Woodrick v Weedon case, the barn case. In this case, the daughter, who owned a share of the barn, wanted to keep it saying it increased the property value. Her brother and mother, who owned the other share of the barn, wanted to demolish the barn saying that it would raise the property value. The court went into a keep discussion about waste and determined that the property value would actually rise if the barn was demolished, and it would be an economic waste keeping as they would not get the best value for their land. The court determined that the best course of action was to demolish the barn, and monetarily compensate the opposing party. With waste, the burden is on the non-favoring party that has a right to the land has to prove that keeping the property would not be a waste of any kind. In this situation, we would say that Fiona has the burden of proving that selling the house would not be an economic waste or a waste of any kind. However, unless Eve violates the condition and takes a substantial step in an attempt to sell the house, Fiona has no legal right to argue anything about waste. This is also like the Ark Land v. Caudill case. In this case, Ark Land wanted to buy out the property of the Caudill heirs to use for coal mining purposes. The heirs argued that this is their land, they use it during the summertime months (just like a normal owner would use a summer home), and they have sentimental value to it. The courts in this case determined that economic value is not the only test when assessing whether a land should be partitioned in sale or partitioned in kind. Although partition is not applicabloe here, the reasoning is. The courts ruled that one may have sentimental and longstanding connection with a land, which would make them want to keep the land rather than sell it. This reasoning is justifiable just as much as economic value is. The courts held that it would be unfair to infringe on ones right to their land simply for economic value. This promotes fairness. Fiona holding Eve accountable: As mentioned above, if Eve was to take a substantial step towards selling the house, that would be a violation of the conveyance granted by Dana, the grantor. Thus, the land would likely go to Dana's issue, her daughter, Fiona. Fiona becomes sentimental and wants to move back home, assuming that Eve will pay for all the ones right to their land simply for economic value. This promotes fairness. Fiona holding Eve accountable: As mentioned above, if Eve was to take a substantial step towards selling the house, that would be a violation of the conveyance granted by Dana, the grantor. Thus, the land would likely go to Dana's issue, her daughter, Fiona. Fiona becomes sentimental and wants to move back home, assuming that Eve will pay for all the repairs. It is correct to infer that Eve, the current landlord, will pay for all the repairs needed to be done to the house to make it livable. This goes to the implied warranty of habitability in a residential area. This warranty cannot be waived, and violating such would be the same as constructive eviction. The implied warranty of habitability assumes that a residential area is up to safe and sanitary housing standards. A case emphasizing such would be Hilder v. St. Peter, the slumlord case. In this case, a poor woman residing with her mother and infants in the home was subject to a disgusting apartment. There was sewage in the basement, the walls were rotting and leaking, the roof fell apart in her room near her infants crib. The house was utterly disgusting. The court went into depth about discussing the reasonable expectations of residing in a home and that the landlord should fix it. It is one thing when caveat emptor/caveat lessee applies, which puts the tenant on constructive notice about the conditions of the home. However, the implied warranty of habitability cannot be waived, and if safe and sanitary conditions are not met, the tenant can not be liable to rent. Technically, if the safe and sanitary housing conditions are not met, the landlord shouldn't even be able to rent out the house until it is up to standards. By forcing the landlord to fix the conditions, this also avoids self-help measures that the tenant might resort to, that are frowned upon by the courts. The courts disfavor self-help measures. "," Essay 2: Hilder v. St. Peter is a slumlord case, as mentioned in the previous question, that talks about the implied warranty of habitability (IWH). Although IWH applies to residential areas, a rule the court held can be applied here. The rule is that if there is a serious issue, the tenant should (1) put the landlord on notice, give the landlord a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue, and (3) if nothing gets fixed, leave the premise within the reasonable amount of time. The covenant of quient enjoyment (CQE) is somewhat the IWH of commercial spaces. A breach of a CQE requires the same steps as a breach of the IWH. One thing that is stressed in Hilder v. St. Peter, however, is that vacating the premise is a drastic measure and should be taken with caution. If the court finds the tenant to not have been actually partially or constructively evicted, they may be liable for the whole rent during the period they were not present. As Peter's attorney, I would go over the facts with him in detail to make sure that the court cannot find him reasonably liable for rent in any way. The CQE Peter is entitled to in his pizza shop allows him to ""quietly enjoy"" the property he is paying for and all that comes with it, as stated in the lease. Peter can be found not liable for the rent if the facts of this case lead the court to find that he was either actually, actually partially, or constructively evicted from his place. If Peter is found to not have been evicted in any of the periously mentioned ways, he can be entitled to damages. In this case, Peter can likely be entitled to damages by Linda due to the severe inconvenience and the loss of revenue. But, if Peter prefers to vacate the premise, we must focus on the landlord's breach of contract and breach of CQE so that we can reason that the court should find Peter not liable for rent and not liable to complete his five-year lease. Peter, the pizza owner, and Linda, the landlord, entered into a term of years lease, for five years. Since 2007, Peter has been renewing his lease. His current lease is from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2023. The contract they agreed upon involved a common right of access, a common use of the parking lot, and one designated parking spot. In the spring, assuming it was a few months into the renewed lease of the pizza shop, the landlord needed to make repairs that ended up taking a lot longer than expected. One week turned into months. Peter used to use the back door, which gave customers parking in the lot easy access to the shop, and made deliveries much quicker. Linda told Peter that the repairs would only be a week. This would be inconvenient for Peter and his business; however, it would only be temporary. The contractors put up scaffolding across the rear of the building, which would make access to the back door inconvenient, yet possible. Also, delivieries made through the back door became impossible due to the maze of scaffolding and the difficulty of carrying the boxes through that maze. If I am advising Peter, I would say that his inability to use the back door would not be a breach of the lease in any way due to the fact that the lease had the language, ""common right of access,"". The lease does not specify that Peter will have access through the back door specifically, but as long as he has a common right of access to his shop somehow, which 10 he does through the main entrance that faces Main Street. Although inconvenient, Peter cannot assert a claim against his inability to use the back door because this inconvenience does not breach the contract. Using this reasoning, Linda can became impossible due to the maze of scaffolding and the difficulty of carrying the boxes through that maze. If I am advising Peter, I would say that his inability to use the back door would not be a breach the lease in any way due to the fact that the lease had the language, ""common right of access,"". The lease does not specify that Peter will have access through the back door specifically, but as long as he has a common right of access to his shop somehow, which he does through the main entrance that faces Main Street. Although inconvenient, Peter cannot assert a claim against his inability to use the back door because this inconvenience does not breach the contract. Using this reasoning, Linda can argue that mere inconvenience and annoyance is not enough to sufficiently prove constructive eviction. A breach of contract that Peter might be able to assert is the parking spot. In the lase, Peter has one designated parking spot that he uses for his car. The construction equiptment for the renovations encroaches into his parking spot. Although minor, this encroachment is significant because Peter pays rent to enjoy and utilize his parking in its entirely. Although Mannillo v. Gorski (front steps case) is centered around adverse possession, a holding of the court applies here. In the front steps case, the court reasoned that a minor encroachment requires actual knowledge. Peter, here, has actual knowledge of the encorachment because he can see the equiptment pass the white line into his parking spot. It is worth mentioning here that the construction company by no means can assert a potention adverse possession claim on the parking spot. To assert an adverse possession claim, the possession has to be continuous, hostile and under a claim of right, actual, notorious and open, and exclusive. From the first element, the possession needs to be continuous for the period of the statute of limitations, which is 10 years accoring to New Suffolk General Law. It would be ridiculous if the renovations took 10 years. That would be highly unlikely. The next strongest element to dispute would be hostile and under a claim of right. New Suffolk follows the objective standard which renders the state of mind of the adverse possessor irrlevant. However, Linda gave permission for the construction company to park where they did. Permission alone negates any adverse possession claim that can be asserted. Actual -- they did actually did possess the piece of property by placing their equiptment there. Notorious and Open -- as mentioned, the court in Mannillo v. Gorski held that a minor encroachment requires actual knowledge. In this case, Peter had actual knowledge of the encorachment and it was in the open. Exclusive -- Construction company and Peter both had use of the parking spot. Peter should have had exclusive use to the parking spot, as only one person can have exclusive spot as it should be used for as mentioned in the lease (which is to park a vehicle). Although Peter is likely not able to bring a breach contract claim based on the inconvenience of not being able to use the back door, Peter can likely bring a breach of contract claim due to the construction equiptment encroaching into his parking spot. Peter pays rent per month to enjoy all In this case, Peter had actual knowledge of the encorachment and it was in the open. Exclusive -- Construction company and Peter both had use of the parking spot. Peter should have had exclusive use to the parking spot, as only one person can have exclusive spot as it should be used for as mentioned in the lease (which is to park a vehicle). Although Peter is likely not able to bring a breach of contract claim based on the inconvenience of not being able to use the back door, Peter can likely bring a breach of contract claim due to the construction equiptment encroaching into his parking spot. Peter pays rent per month to enjoy all aspects of the rent, which includes the parking spot in its entirely. Violation of such might render Peter not liable to pay rent. the same situation occured in the brick wall case, there the landlord build a brick wall alongside the property the tenant was renting, which encroached onto the rented property. Due to the fast that the tenant was not able to enjoy what she was paying for, the court found that she is not liable to pay rent. A rationale the court mentioned was the fact that the tenant was paying a amount to enjoy the entire piece of land. With the encorachment, she was not able to enjoy it all. The court held that the landlord can either lessen the rent in accordance with the amount of property that can actually be used, or the tenant will not be liable for rent. Taking this reasoning into consideration, Linda did lessen Peter's rent by $1000. However, it is not clear whether she did that for only one month, or all the months that the construction was going on. Applying the same reasoning in the brick wall case to Linda and Peter's case, Linda should deduct the rent for each month the construction equiptment is encoraching on the parking spot, or should find him not liable for the rent in its entirely. Linda can aruge that she is trying to accomodate Peter and his inconvenience by lessening the rent. Her argument to accomodate might be stronger if she kept the lesser amount of rent during the entirely of the construction period. This might help Peter with his finances as he is struggling to meet sales during the construction. This case at hand is significantly similar to the Echo Consulting case. In Echo Consulting, construction was also occuring in their building which prevented them from using a door they regularly accessed. However, similar to our case at hand, the lease in Echo Consulting gave them a common right of access and a common use of a parking lot. In neither leases did it specify which door was specific to the tenant, it only stated that they had a common right of access. Taking this reasoning into consideration, as long as Echo Consulting (and Peter) and access to the building through an entrance, that would satisfy the ""common right of access"" language. The noises and the inconvenience of the construction in Echo Consulting is also parrallel here. Peter has a pizza shop and there is dust and debris flying everywhere, forcing him to keep his windows and doors and a common use of a parking lot. In neither leases did it specify which door was specific to the tenant, it only stated that they had a common right of access. Taking this reasoning into consideration, as long as Echo Consulting (and Peter) and access to the building through an entrance, that would satisfy the ""common right of access"" language. The noises and the inconvenience of the construction in Echo Consulting is also parrallel here. Peter has a pizza shop and there is dust and debris flying everywhere, forcing him to keep his windows and doors shut (who wants dusty pizza? No one). The noise of the construction in both cases is also loud and inconvenient. They key word here is inconvenient. The court in Echo Consulting held that although the construction noises was not allowing Echo Consulting to ""quietly enjoy"" their property, the construction was just temporary rather than permanent. The same can be said here since the construction was only supposed to take one week and did not indefinitely violate their CQE. The fact that the construction goes from one week to more than one month becomes an issue. This can be analogous in some ways to the Reste Realty Corp. case. Reste Realty was renting a lower level space in an office building that experienced fooding during rainy days and storms. Under preious ownership, the landlord would always accommodate Reste Realty and fix the flooding issues immediately. Under new ownership, the new landlord would not fix the issue no matter how many times Reste Realty Corp. complained. Reste Realty Corp. argued that their CQE was violated and left the premise. The landlord sued them for not paying rent and the court held that (1) Reste Realty Corp. gave notice to the landlord, (2) they have the landlord a reasonable about of time to fix it (by calling him each time the office space flooded (which was more than once) and receiving no accommodation) and (3) left within a reasonable amount of time. After the office space flooded a few times and the landlord did not fix the issue, Reste Realty Corp. vacated the premise. They were constructively evicted because it was ""as if"" they were evicted, they were not able to enjoy their office space as the flooding destroyed property they had and it was inconvenient and time costly to fix the space each time it flooded. Peter gave Linda (1) notice of the issues by calling her every week, (2) gave her a reasonable time to fix the issue (which turned into an extended period of months), all that is left is for him to (3) vacate the premise within a reasonable amount of time. To property advise Peter on if he should vacate the premise of not, and whether he would be liable for rent or not, I would need more information on how many months it has been that the construction has been going on and how many months Linda lessened the rent for. As mentioned before, leaving is a drastic measure and if the court finds in any way that Peter was not constructively evicted of his property, then he may be found liable for the rest of the five-year term. Also, if it has been months that premise within a reasonable amount of time. To property advise Peter on if he should vacate the premise of not, and whether he would be liable for rent or not, I would need more information on how many months it has been that the construction has been going on and how many months Linda lessened the rent for. As mentioned before, leaving is a drastic measure and if the court finds in any way that Peter was not constructively evicted of his property, then he may be found liable for the rest of the five-year term. Also, if it has been months that this is going on, let's say 2, 3, or 4+ months, Linda is likely to argue that the ""reasonable amount of time"" standard/period has exceeded. If this situation went on for two months and Linda lessened the rent accordingly, she would have a strong claim to say that she is trying to accomodate the inconveniences, and may likely pay Peter damages rather than finding him not liable for rent in its entirely for the remainder of the term of years lease. As mentioned above, courts are reluctant to justify tenant resorting to self-help measures. The courts generally favor what is best for the tenant. Linda can also argue that she has been renting this property to Peter for 10+ years and neither of them has had any issue with one another. The landord/tenant relationship has gon smoothly up until the construction. This is unlike in Reste Realty Corp., where Reste Realty had a good standing relationship with the previous landlord who would always solve the issue of flooding for them. When the new landlord came along, they refused to fix the flooding. Here, Peter and Linda have a longstanding relationship and it is evident that Linda is sympathetic, apologetic and is trying to accomodate Peter during the inconvenience of the construction period. Finding a resultion might be what is best for both parties rather than Peter vacating the premise. The courts favor mitigaton between parties. So, if Linda and Peter can mitigate some sort of damage payment or accomodation due to the inconveniences of the construction, that may be best for both parties. ",1831,2670
4b0d600d-5f9d-4ce5-b7cc-6394e14a9d7d," Essay 1: Conveyances: Dana's conveyance of Blackacre likely conveyed to Eve either a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) or a fee simple determinable (FSD) based on the language used in the conveyance. First, like in White v. Brown, where language such as ""the house is not to be sold"" would place a restraint on a fee simple absolute, here the language is used again. Therefore, the court will likely follow the rule in Brown that there is no fee simple absolute here because a grantor cannot place restraints on a fee simple absolute conveyance so that security and free alienability can be further promoted. Next, the language used in the conveyance, ""provided that"" and ""only so long as"" creates both a condition subsequent and is durational. Here, the ambiguous conveyance could likely result in either a FSSCS or a FSD. Like in the case with Harry (discussing FSSCS versus FSD), the court may utilize the rules of construction to determine which would apply. Unlike in Harry, where the court chose FSD because there would be no forfeiture of the land, the court would likely choose FSSCS here because it is favored more greatly in the rules of construction to protect from property being forfeited. Therefore, Dana would either have a possibility of reverter (if the court found that Eve had FSD) or a right of re-entry if the house were to be sold. Despite Fiona receiving all of Dana's personal property in her will, Fiona does not have any future interest in the property. Even if the property were to be sold, Dana's estate holds the future interest in the property, not Fiona. If Fiona were to receive Dana's estate, then she would have either a right of re-entry or possibility of reverter in Blackacre in fee simple absolute, depending on whether Dana conveyed a FSSCS or FSD. Sale of Blackacre: The largest weakness to Eve's attempt to sell the property is the clear language of the conveyance, which establishes that the intent of the grantor is obviously that the house not be sold. Being the first to consider in the rules of construction, this would be a difficult factor to overcome. However, waste and the best interests of all of the parties involved may2overcome the intent of the grantor if applicable. Eve could make several arguments regarding the sale of Blackacre. First, the courts encourage the Sale of Blackacre: The largest weakness to Eve's attempt to sell the property is the clear language of the conveyance, which establishes that the intent of the grantor is obviously that the house not be sold. Being the first to consider in the rules of construction, this would be a difficult factor to overcome. However, waste and the best interests of all of the parties involved may overcome the intent of the grantor if applicable. Eve could make several arguments regarding the sale of Blackacre. First, the courts encourage the prevention of waste. Here, the land is being both permissively and economically waste. Since Blackacre is not being maintained or used at the time that Eve receives the offer and has not been for many years, she could argue that the land is being wasted through negligence. Like in Baker, where she was no longer able to maintain the land and was struggling to afford it, here Blackacre has been abandoned and left to overgrow. Additionally, Blackacre would likely fall under a broad analysis the remaindermen rule, which deals with when the property is not being maintained and taxes are not being paid, resulting in waste. Despite Eve paying taxes, the property has been completely abandoned. Therefore, the court may follow the holding in Baker that Blackacre should be sold in order to prevent further permissive waste. Additionally, Eve could argue that keeping Blackacre is economic waste because of its increased value. Whereas in Woodrick, the barn was removed to increase the value of the property despite the land having future interests, here the court may find that the property could be sold because the value of the property is greater if sold than if kept in its current condition. However, in Woodrick, the discussion was only of ameliorative waste (making changes to the property) and it did not consider the sale of the entire property, which would be a more extreme decision. To continue, in Baker the property would be more valuable if sold since the owner could no longer maintain it and it was of no use to her, therefore the sale would prevent economic waste by forcing her to keep it. Similarly, allowing Eve to sell the property which she is not mainting or using may prevent the economic waste which would ensue by forcing her to keep it. Therefore, the court may find that prohibiting Eve from selling the property is an example of economic waste and so it should be sold. The policy rationale for this is to promote productive use of land and prevent the opposite. The test for a sale of property is not only financial, however. Eve could also argue that the sale of Blackacre would benefit all of the parties involved and therefore it should be sold. Like in Baker, where the grantor left the property to his wife to provide her with a home but the space became to expensive and difficult to maintain, here Eve and Fiona have both abandoned the property for many years and Eve is only paying the taxes necessary on the porperty and a lot of work would need to be done to make all of the repairs necessary, which would likely be expensive. Therefore, the court may follow the holding in Baker that the sale of the property would benefit all of the parties involved and therefore the property The test for a sale of property is not only financial, however. Eve could also argue that the sale of Blackacre would benefit all of the parties involved and therefore it should be sold. Like in Baker, where the grantor left the property to his wife to provide her with a home but the space became to expensive and difficult to maintain, here Eve and Fiona have both abandoned the property for many years and Eve is only paying the taxes necessary on the porperty and a lot of work would need to be done to make all of the repairs necessary, which would likely be expensive. Therefore, the court may follow the holding in Baker that the sale of the property would benefit all of the parties involved and therefore the property should be sold. In doing so, the court may follow the solution in Woodrick, where the value of the barn was given to the future interest holders, by giving to Fiona a portion of the profits from the sale of the property to protect the best interests of all of the parties involved. However, Eve would be faced with the argument that emotional value is important too and that she should not be able to sell Blackacre because of its importance within the family. Like in Ark Land, where the company was unable to purchase the remaining 33% of the property from the heirs on the basis that they had lived there for generations and had an attachment to the land, here Fiona could argue that Blackacre has an abundance of emotional value and that her attachment to the land aligned with the clear intent of Dana is more important than the profits that would result from the sale. The reasoning for this is that property has deep roots in our society and more than just economic factors should be considered when giving it up. Fiona: Fiona would only have a basis for reclaiming ownership if she were the person to receive Dana's estate only once Eve were attempting to sell the house because the condition would be broken, resulting in a reversion of the property to Dana's estate in fee simple absolute. Prior to this, Fiona has no original basis to reclaim ownership of the property. In this case, Fiona could argue that Eve would be responsible for the repairs on the basis that as a landowner she had the duty to not commit waste and by abandoning the property she had committed permissive waste through negligence, though it would be a difficult argument to make. "," Essay 2: Peter may have several options to leave the space without having to be responsible for the rest of the rent. First, Peter could argue that the construction equipment that is encroaching on his parking spot is a 2) Essay 2: Peter may have several options to leave the space without having to be responsible for the rest of the rent. First, Peter could argue that the construction equipment that is encroaching on his parking spot is a partial eviction, which violates the lease and would therefore negate the entirety of the rent. At common law, any partial eviction would negate the entirety of the rent. Like in the brick wall case, where the encroachment was negligible, here Peter is experiencing a very minor encroachment on his parking spot that is included in the lease. Therefore, at common law Peter would likely no longer be responsible for the duration of the rent. However, modern principles would likely distinguish from this rule and instead favor a renegotiation of the rent in accordance with the minor encroachment. The reason for this is that in practice it is not reasonable to expect to be released from a lease on the basis of something minor because the integrity of lease agreements is stronger if not broken except when necessary. Renegotiating the rent instead of terminating the lease also promotes security. Next, Peter may argue that the ongoing construction, including the scaffolding blocking reasonable access to the back door, has resulted in an actual partial eviction and therefore has violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE), which would cause a breach of the lease agreement and terminate his responsibility to pay rent. In many cases, a common area would not constitute an eviction. In Echo, the court held that a common entrance being blocked when the company still had their main entrance and the common entrance was not listed in the lease would not constitute an actual partial eviction. However, unlike in Echo, here the common area is listed in the lease as a part of the property which Peter is entitled to use. Therefore, the court may distinguish from the holding in Echo that there was no partial eviction because here the common area that is obstructed is listed in the lease. If so, the partial actual eviction would result in a breach of the lease agreement and Peter would be able to leave without having to pay the duration of the rent. However, Peter would also need to prove that there was an actual partial eviction, which may prove difficult given that he could still use the back entrance, though less efficiently. Unlike in Echo, where the common entrance was entirely blocked off, here Peter can use the entrance it is just less efficient. Therefore, the court may find that there was no actual partial eviction. Even if Peter cannot prove that there was a partial actual eviction, he could be awarded damages for the interference which may help him recover from the decrease in profits that was caused by the construction. Like in Echo, where the court found that there was no breach of the lease but there was still an interference so they awarded damages in accordance, here Peter could also receive the damages partial eviction, which may prove difficult given that he could still use the back entrance, though less efficiently. Unlike in Echo, where the common entrance was entirely blocked off, here Peter can use the entrance it is just less efficient. Therefore, the court may find that there was no actual partial eviction. Even if Peter cannot prove that there was a partial actual eviction, he could be awarded damages for the interference which may help him recover from the decrease in profits that was caused by the construction. Like in Echo, where the court found that there was no breach of the lease but there was still an interference so they awarded damages in accordance, here Peter could also receive the damages for the interference. A third argument Peter could make is that the construction has resulted in a constructive eviction, meaning that the interference is so substantial that it has resulted in a situation where the space is so unusable that it is ""as if"" the tenant had been evicted. With a constructive eviction, a breach of the lease would occur, resulting in Peter being able to leave without having to further pay rent. If he could prove that the intereference was so substantial, Peter would be able to make this argument only if he had notified the landlord of the problems repeatedly, the issues were permanent, and he left within a timely manner. First, for a constructive eviction the landlord must have knowledge of the interference. This is obviously met because Peter repeatedly notified the landlord of the problems just like in Reste, where the tenant repeatedly notified the landlord and was able to leave on the basis of constructive eviction. Next, the problems caused by the construction must be considered permanent. An interference can be considered permanent when it is recurring or ongoing. Like in Reste, where the court held that recurring flooding is enough to result in permanent interference as it pertains to constructive eviction, here the problems caused by the construction are constant and ongoing. Therefore, the court would likely follow the reasoning in Reste that this would constitute permanent because it is ongoing and constant. The following issue is whether Peter left in a timely manner. Typically, leaving in a timely manner would not extend as long as months like in this case. However, because Peter relied on information that the construction would not take so long, it is likely that he left in a timely manner. Like in Reste, where the tenant signed the lease in reliance of the landlord fixing the problems, here Peter relied on the promises that the construction would be completed within days, then weeks, and then finally months. Therefore, the court will likely follow the holding in Reste that he left in a timely manner despite remaining there for months because he was acting in reliance on the landlord's promise that the interferences would be resolved. Finally, Peter would need to prove that the interference was so substantial that it rendered the space unusable. Peter could argue that the decrease in profits would render the space unusable since it is a business and it is based on profits. However, he would encounter difficulties in that the space actually is being used throughout the duration of the construction. Unlike in Reste, where the office space was repeatedly flooded until it was no longer functional, here Peter's business is still able to the court will likely follow the holding in Reste that he left in a timely manner despite remaining there for months because he was acting in reliance on the landlord's promise that the interferences would be resolved. Finally, Peter would need to prove that the interference was so substantial that it rendered the space unusable. Peter could argue that the decrease in profits would render the space unusable since it is a business and it is based on profits. However, he would encounter difficulties in that the space actually is being used throughout the duration of the construction. Unlike in Reste, where the office space was repeatedly flooded until it was no longer functional, here Peter's business is still able to operate. Therefore, the court may or may not find that the interference was so substantial to constitute a constructive eviction. The reasoning for this is that a tenant should not be able to break a lease just because they want to. Rather, the interference should be impacting the tenant to such a great extent that it is ""as if"" they were evicted by the interference, not just because it is no longer convenient for them to remain tenants. Finally, Peter would not be able to argue that this interference was impeding on the implied warranty of habitability (IWH). The IWH typically only pertains to residential leases to begin as it is intended to protect the rights of tenants to live in humane spaces. Additionally, the extent of this interference is not impacting the essential facilities and function of the property to an extent that the property is not being maintained by the landlord. Therefore, Peter would not be able to make this argument to break free from the lease. ",1394,1406
51b92ef5-990f-4f49-954a-e4f9f0ef4fd1," Eve's Argument Regarding Interest Created at the Time of Conveyance Eve will likely argue that she owns BA in fee simple absolute, with voided alienation language, via the precedent set by the White v. Brown. Similar to the present facts of this case, the language of the conveyance includes language like ""the house is not to be sold,"" which directly parallels White. Though the conveyance sounds almost like a fee simple determinable with the durational language utilized, the court is not kind towards any conveyance which limits the future alienability [transferability] of a property. Thus, following the White rule, Eve likely holds the property in fee simple absolute, with voided alienation language, and via FSA, can sell the property to the developer. Similar to the White case, without finding an FSA, the resulting conveyance could result in partial intestacy, as it is unclear if in her will she conveys the possibility of reverter back to her estate. Moreover, a possibility of reverter is not a certain future interest, like a vested remainder, and can only occur upon the violation of the durational language, and the court when construing conveyances towards future interests is generally kinder to vested rather than contingent future interest. Moreover, the court, as stated in White, always favors FSA over all else.The court is unkind to partial intestacy, and thus it necessitates a finding of FSA. This is likely be Eve's best argument towards the language of the conveyance, as a conveyance of FSA that voids the alienation language will destroy Fiona's potential future interest, as an issue of Dana's estate. The policy reason behind supporting FSA goes back to recordation - the court has an interest in certainty in keeping clean title. Furthermore, even assuming that the conveyance did create a fee simple determinable, as F contends, simply discussing a possible price with a real estate developer without drafting a purchase and sales agreement or receiving a deposit is not the same as entertaining a conversation. This will not rise to the level of a violation of the conveyance, and should not result in the possibility of reverter automatically passing to F via the violation. E's Best Argument for Permitting Sale of BA If the court finds FSA with voided alienability language, E has the champion of all estates. FSA is the closest thing to absolute ownership in real property. If you own a property in FSA, it guarantees you the ability to sell, lease, convey, mortgage, use, etc. the land, however you please. One of the sources level of a violation of the conveyance, and should not result in the possibility of reverter automatically passing to F via the violation. E's Best Argument for Permitting Sale of BA If the court finds FSA with voided alienability language, E has the champion of all estates. FSA is the closest thing to absolute ownership in real property. If you own a property in FSA, it guarantees you the ability to sell, lease, convey, mortgage, use, etc. the land, however you please. One of the sources which supports this is the Statute Quia Emptores,which was the first requirement of the common law that interests be freely alienable [sellable/transferrable]. Thus, if the court as discussed above does find an FSA in favor of E, then F has no legal leg to stand on to prevent her from selling the property to the developer. Similar to the greatest irony of the conveyance in the White case, though the grantor's ultimate intent was to prevent the sale of the home, the court is actually takes diskindly to alienation language, and is likely not to enforce it, which could result in the ultimate sale of the home. The policy reason behind not allowing alienation language is that it promotes certainty in title. Moreover, to establish partition by sale, the sale must not prejudice one party, must promote the interests of the other, and show that the property cannot be conviently partitioned in kind. Moreover, per the Arkland case, economic utility is not the only factor considered for partition by sale. Rather, the court may also consider emotional or longstanding relationship to the property. However, if E holds in FSA, then as discussed above, she can sell the property without prejudiciing anyone, and it certainly promotes her own interests. Moreover, even assuming the future POR for F, E can also question her emotional and longstanding relationship to the property, similar to the dissent in Arkland. The dissent in Arkland emphasized that the concurrent interest holders sporadic use of the property on the weekends does not establish the necessary emotional connection to prevent partition by sale. Similar to the case at bar, sporadic weekend use in Arkland is similar to F not living on the property from 2003 until 2019 - that's sixteen years. It would be hard, even with nostalgia and sentimental attachment, to establish an emotional or longstanding relationship with a property that you have not visited in 16 years. The policy reason behind allowing economic considerations in the sale of property, as highlighted by the dissent in Arkland is that certain objectives will have an important social and economic utility rationales which have a large impact on society as a whole [the coal industry v. a public highway]. Clearly, here, E could argue that the economic value of the property was not being maximized, and the property should be sold similar to Arkland. E's Best Arguments Regarding Waste E did not commit waste by exercising reasonable care when maintaining the property. She puts the the dissent in Arkland is that certain objectives will have an important social and economic utility rationales which have a large impact on society as a whole [the coal industry v. a public highway]. Clearly, here, E could argue that the economic value of the property was not being maximized, and the property should be sold similar to Arkland. E's Best Arguments Regarding Waste E did not commit waste by exercising reasonable care when maintaining the property. She puts the real estate taxes on auto-pay, and she locks the door of the property before traveling from New Suffolk to FL. She has quite a good reason for leaving the premises, given that her sentimental attachment to the property and to D leave her unable to remain after the death of D. She does exercise reasonable care by putting the bills on autopay and ensuring that no real estate tax encumbrances attach to title. Not utilizing the property for its best function and selling it to the developer constitutes economic waste, similar to the rationales of the coal company in Arkland or the children in Baker v. Weedon that wanted to hold onto the property to cash in on its equity. Economic waste implies not using a property for its most economically efficient function. Here, E will likely argue that by not selling BA for a considerable profit, the future interest holder, F, was committing economic waste and not using the property for the best economic value. The policy reasons behind supporting economic waste is land use [similar to the earning theory] Fiona's Argument Regarding the Interest Created at Time of Conveyance Fiona will likely argue that the use of the language, ""so long as"" the house was not sold, created a fee simple determinable, and as such, D's estate retained the possibility of reverter, which passes automatically upon the violation of the condition contained in the conveyance. Similar to the White dissent, clearly D knew how to give away all of her assets with certainty, leaving all of her personal property to F. Thus, F will argue that it was not the true intent of the grantor to leave the property to E in FSA, but rather to include the durational language. If this was an FSD, as F will aruge, then the property will automatically convey upon the violation of the durational language. Although it is questionable by the language of the conveyance what ""attempt to convey"" actually required, the court is likely to look to the intent of the grantor in construing the conveyance. In the present case, clearly D wants to prevent the sale of the home and any inquiry regarding sale. Thus, F will likely argue that by E even entertaining the conversation with the real estate developer, she had violated the durational language of the FSD, and via the possibility of reverter, the interest in the land conveyed automatically make to the estate, and F as sole issue, would be entitled. Thus F's bet argument is that she now owns the property in FSA, given that the durational language of the FSD was violated by the interest holder, and questionable by the language of the conveyance what ""attempt to convey"" actually required, the court is likely to look to the intent of the grantor in construing the conveyance. In the present case, clearly D wants to prevent the sale of the home and any inquiry regarding sale. Thus, F will likely argue that by E even entertaining the conversation with the real estate developer, she had violated the durational language of the FSD, and via the possibility of reverter, the interest in the land conveyed automatically make to the estate, and F as sole issue, would be entitled. Thus F's bet argument is that she now owns the property in FSA, given that the durational language of the FSD was violated by the interest holder, and the interest automatically passes to F. F's Best Argument for Not Permitting Sale of BA Fiona has a similar basis for asserting her proscription against sale; if the court finds an FSD, upon the violation of the condition of the conveyance, the property would automatically pass to D's estate, and F being the only issue, would have an undeniable interest, if not the entire interest. As such, F is a future interest holder [or even a present interest holder - depending on the court's determination of the violation of the conveyance language], and should be considered not only when deciding whether to sell or not sell the property, but also, her future interest prevents E from committing waste on the property given that E, as a present interest holder, has a duty to leave the property largely unchanged. Forced sale must be in the best interests of all the parties and must be out of necessity [Baker v. Weedon]; this sale is not in the best interest of F and is not out of necessity, thus should not be enforced. There is no present economic financial need of any party and F has a strong sentimental/emotional connection to the property which should outweigh E's economic objectives. Via Baker v. Weedon, sale must be determined by the best interests of the property. Clearly, E would like to flip a quick profit, given that she no longer lives at the property and it is worth far more than she originally anticipated. However, via Baker, clearly F would has an emotional and sentimental attachment to the property, given that she grew up there, and would like to live there now. This clearly prejudices F's emotional/sentimental interest and would not satisfy the three part test enumerated above for partition by sale. Thus, E should not be able to compel forced sale. E commits permissive waste by not caring for the property or exercising reasoanble care to ensure that some cared for the property, and thus E should be liable for the waste. Amerliorative waste involves waste the actually improves the value of the property [like in Woodrick v. Wood where the removal of a barn actually increased the value of the property]. Woodrick was also an example of affirmative waste - the intentional destruction of structures on the property. Clearly, the property was not improved in value and E's actions were not active but rather permissive, in that she failed to exercise the reasonable care to maintain the property as a present interest holder. This is clear by the roof shingles missing, the glass E commits permissive waste by not caring for the property or exercising reasoanble care to ensure that some cared for the property, and thus E should be liable for the waste.

This is clear by the roof shingles missing, the glass cracked, and other various serious problems. Clearly in a place like New Suffolk which has such harsh winters, E should have exercised reasonable care to maintain and check on the property, and as such, should be liable for the damages.The policy reason behind holding a present interest holder accountable for waste is that they have a duty to future interest holders to leave the property unchanged, and thus, the court must enforce for fairness and equity principles. "," Objective Observations Unfortunately for Peter, he has a commercial lease, which does affect the options available to him in terms of options in his lease. The implied warranty of habitability, which cannot be waived, and is illustrated by the Hilder precedent, only applies to residential settings and is not available here. This is unfortunate for P given that the options available for a breach of the IWH, are much wider than that of a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment [CQE] or constructive eviction [CE]. Under a breach of IWH [BOIWH], the tenant can receive damages, recission the rent + abandon, renegotiate the rent, or repair it himself and withhold rent. Punitive damages are also available. BOCQE or BOCQE via CE may have more limited remedies available. Also for any of the previous breachs mentioned, please note that the LL MUST BE RESPONSIBLE for the interference with the leasehold premises. P's Best Arguments Supporting a Breach of CQE Under modern law, the duty to pay rent for a tenancy for years lease, is a mutually dependent covenant upon the duty to furnish space by the LL via the covenant of quiet enjoyment. This is a tenancy for years lease given that it has a fixed term to end on a certain date. Thus if the LL breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the tenant is not required to pay rent for the remainder of the leasehold term. This will likely be P's strongest argument in6abandoning the premises, without being held liable for the past due rent, is that the LL violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The policy rationale behind requiring mutually dependent covenants is that it should be the LL's duty to furnish a safe space, as she Under modern law, the duty to pay rent for a tenancy for years lease, is a mutually dependent covenant upon the duty to furnish space by the LL via the covenant of quiet enjoyment. This is a tenancy for years lease given that it has a fixed term to end on a certain date. Thus if the LL breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the tenant is not required to pay rent for the remainder of the leasehold term. This will likely be P's strongest argument in abandoning the premises, without being held liable for the past due rent, is that the LL violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The policy rationale behind requiring mutually dependent covenants is that it should be the LL's duty to furnish a safe space, as she will likely be more accustomed to code violations. Moreover, the modern court moves away from caveat emptor/lessee rationales, on a social utility theory - that for the betterment of society, LL's should furnish safe leased spaces. Even absent a finding that the interference with the possession of the leased spaces does not rise to constructive eviction, P can still be entitled to damages for his hardship. In the present case, LL is clearly repsonsible for any supposed interference with the leased premises, given that the hypo provides that the construction commences to perform repairs on the building at the LL's direction. Under the precedent set forth in the Echo Consulting case, a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is not only available for an LL's interference with actual possession, but also for a substantial interference with tenant's possession of the leased space. Similar to Echo, the tenant in the present case was guaranteed two accesspoint to his leased premises when signing the lease; the front and back entrances [the front opening onto Main Street and the back containing the parking lot]. Like the denail of access to the leased premises via one accesspoint but not the other in Echo, because of the construction, P is denied access to his rear door. Moreover, because of the scaffolding, customers are less likely to come in the front door, distinguishing Echo, given that there were issues imposed by the LL on both accesspoints in the present case. The court held in Echo that the interference with one egress point without disturbing the other, was not substantial enough to warrant constructive eviction, but that damages may still be available. However, distinguishing the interference with egress in the present case, versus the interference with egress in Echo, the accesspoint here actually affects P's business, in that delivery drivers due to the construction, could no longer get in and out of the parking lot with ease. Moreover, the interference here is far more substantial than the interference in Echo; whereas in Echo, the access to a door did not interfere with the lessee's business operations, in the present case, the construction created noise and dust which negatively impacted P's business. Given that in Echo, the ""interference"" by the LL was related to construction, but rather was more related to the use of one door v. another, and had no impact upon the lessee's business, this7interference is likely far more substantial. Moreover, as a former pizza chef, forcing your employees to work next to an 800 degree oven in the spring and summer with the windows closed is cruel. Here, unlike the court in Echo, the interference is likely the interference here is far more substantial than the interference in Echo; whereas in Echo, the access to a door did not interfere with the lessee's business operations, in the present case, the construction created noise and dust which negatively impacted P's business. Given that in Echo, the ""interference"" by the LL was related to construction, but rather was more related to the use of one door v. another, and had no impact upon the lessee's business, this interference is likely far more substantial. Moreover, as a former pizza chef, forcing your employees to work next to an 800 degree oven in the spring and summer with the windows closed is cruel. Here, unlike the court in Echo, the interference is likely substantial enough and within the LL's responsibility, to necessitate a violation of the tenant's leased premises. Thus, even absent a finding of CE, P could still be entitled to damages. Further distinguishing Echo, from the case at bar, whereas Echo was related purely to communal accesspoints that all persons in the building accessed, the spaces that LL has interfered with in the present case were guaranteed to P by the terms of the lease. The infringement with the use of his designated parking space is similar to the minor encroachment in the Smith v. McEnany wagon case, where though the LL interfered minorly with T's space [only by several inches], the tenant was abated from the entire term of the lease. The Restatement disfavors this view. On policy reasons of fairness and equity favor partial abatement of rent depending on the actual space infringed with - this would mean that at the very lease, P would be entitled for partial abatement of rent given that his parking space is violated by the LL's interference [construction]. P's Best Arguments for CE P may be able to assert a BOCQE via CE under the Reste Realty precedent, given that the interference is substantial and potentially psyedo permanent so long as abandons the premises within a reasonable amount of time. Distinguishing a regular ole' breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and CE, a tenant in a CE situation must abandon the premises and leave within a reasonable amount of time. Via Reste, in order to establish CE via BOCQE, the tenant must be able to assert that the interference for which the LL is responsible is both substantial and permanent, and the tenant must notify the LL and abandonment of the premises in a reasonable amount of time. Similar to the 4-feet of flooding in Reste, a ""final straw"" which necessitates leaving is also helpful. A good strategy for P at the present moment would likely to be abandon the premises immeidately. Given that several months have passed since the spring of 2019 when the construction initially begun, the tenant should vacate immeidately if they intend to claim BOCQE via CE. Though the court does not amount of time, for policy reasons, P must still stick to rigid formalism when determining a reasonable abandon the premises in a time sufficient to satisfy the objective standard. The policy reasons behind the requirement of a reasonable amount of time is that it is a drastic measure for tenants up and leaving the 4-feet of flooding in Reste, a ""final straw"" which necessitates leaving is also helpful. A good strategy for P at the present moment would likely to be abandon the premises immeidately. Given that several months have passed since the spring of 2019 when the construction initially begun, the tenant should vacate immeidately if they intend to claim BOCQE via CE. Though the court does not stick to rigid formalism when determining a reasonable amount of time, for policy reasons, P must still abandon the premises in a time sufficient to satisfy the objective standard. The policy reasons behind the requirement of a reasonable amount of time is that it is a drastic measure for tenants up and leaving their leased premises. Rather, this should be a last resort. Similar to the constant flooding in Reste, although the noise from construction and the presence of construction vehicles in his spot was likely not 24/7, it could likely be guaranteed that on a given day, like the flooding, the noise and dust are almost guaranteed. Moreover, all other elements of CE are present in that T notifies the LL, calling her to express his concerns. Moreover, as discussed above, the interference with his pizza shop is substantial and though not 24/7, but as well be permanent, similar to Reste. The key here is that the tenant must abandon the premises within a reasonable amount of time, and given that months have passed, he's playing with fire. P does reasonable notice and time to repair to the LL given that he calls to express his concerns every week, and it has now been months without the LL addressing her concerns. Thus, LL had a reasonable time to fix the situation with construction and ensure that P's pizza delivery drivers had a reasonable means of access to the back lot and to ensure that the dusty parts of the process occur after operational hours. However, LL fails to do fix the problem within a reasonable amount of time, and therefore, P should be relieved from the obligation to pay rent. Professional Recommendations to P For policy reasons, the court favors putting the onus of litigation on the LL, for certainty and fairness objectives, given that LLs are in a better position to know of the industry landscape. Thus, P should abandon his leased space, to preserve his constructive eviction claim, as discussed above, and wait for his LL to sue for unpaid rent. A prudent tenant would also anticipate the coming litigation and place the contested rent money in an escrow account to later be determined by the court. P should not be alarmed that his LL may come after him, lock him out of the leased premises, or fail to find a later tenant. Under Berg v. Wiley, the LL is not allowed to use self-help remedies such as calling the local sherrif and changing the locks. Rather, due to policy reasons of not wanting to promote violence, the court favors judicial remedies. Thus, his LL will need to pursue the judicial remedy available in his jurisdiction to collect unpaid rent. In Berg, the court reasoned that the state in question of place the contested rent money in an escrow account to later be determined by the court. P should not be alarmed that his LL may come after him, lock him out of the leased premises, or fail to find a later tenant. Under Berg v. Wiley, the LL is not allowed to use self-help remedies such as calling the local sherrif and changing the locks. Rather, due to policy reasons of not wanting to promote violence, the court favors judicial remedies. Thus, his LL will need to pursue the judicial remedy available in his jurisdiction to collect unpaid rent. In Berg, the court reasoned that the state in question of the case had an expedited process anyways to resolve LL/T disputes, and that the court did not want anyone to resolt to dueling. Moreover, even if no breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is found either to necessitate damages or constructive eviction, even after abandonment, LL has a duty to mitigate damages. Under Sommer v. Kridel, the LL is obligated to use reasonable diligence in re-letting the apartment to another tenant for the duration of the tenancy for years. The LL has will have the burden of proof to show reasonable diligence of re-letting the process. The court's policy reasons are that it is easier for the LL to show his own reasonable diligence than for a tenant to have to speciulate. Moreover, there are fairness and equity underpinnings at play here, as well as economic waste theory. It is not fair to have the aparmtent sit unletted and does not use the property in its most economically efficient way possible. Thus, P's LL will actually have the burden of proof to show that he tried to re-let the property. Weakness in P's Argument L will likely argue that there was no breach of the covenant of the quiet enjoyment, and no CE, and thus, P is still bound by the terms of the original 5-year tenancy for years lease. L will likely argue that by performing necessary repairs on the property via the construction, a duty impugned upon her at the common law, she cannot be found to be breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment. For policy reasons pertaining to social utility and the best outcome for society, an LL is expected to use reasaonable care when maintaining her properti. Clearly, as construction usually does, the project did not go to plan. However, LL cannot be held to every unforeseeable consequence of reasonably trying to maintain and care for her property. As a fairness objective, it would not be fair to hold LL for constructive eviction or a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment to the tenant for construction performed in reasonably caring for the property, otherwise the underpinnings of the policy objective of LL care for the property would be completely dissolved and no one would perform maintenance for fear that it would relinquish tenants from their responsibilities under the lease. Furthermore, a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment must be a condition within the LL's responsibillity. The delay of construction cannot be credited to the LL. Construction in any capacity is notoriously slow moving and often encounters unanticipated hurdles and she should not be held liable for institutional and slow-moving nature of or a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment to the tenant for construction performed in reasonably caring for the property, otherwise the underpinnings of the policy objective of LL care for the property would be completely dissolved and no one would perform maintenance for fear that it would relinquish tenants from their responsibilities under the lease. Furthermore, a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment must be a condition within the LL's responsibillity. The delay of construction cannot be credited to the LL. Construction in any capacity is notoriously slow moving and often encounters unanticipated hurdles and she should not be held liable for institutional and slow-moving nature of construction contracts. Moreover, when reading Echo narrowly, the exact same issue of egress and construction are at play here; like the LL in Echo denying one door but not the other, P still had access to the main door, and thus there was no breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment per the direct holding of the Echo court. Similar to the construction in Echo and issues with only one accesspoint, arguably, the only issues at play here are with construction and the limiting of one egress point. Thus, the court may find like in Echo, that the interference was not substantial enough to necessitate CE, nor damages for P. When turning to CE, LL could argue that the interference with the leased premises was not permanent in that it was a short-term construction project that would likely finish when the property was adequately repaired, and thus did not satisfy the ""permanent"" part of the prong set forth in Reste. LL could also argue via Reste that if it was bad enough to warrant a constructive eviction, P has not vacated in a reasonable amount of time, given that it has now been months of construction and he has not vacated. Moreover, after notifying the LL of his issues with the leased premises, LL does make reasonable efforts to fix the problem by giving P $ f of his rent thereafter for the hassle. LL could also argue, weakly, the notion of caveat emptor - buyer beware. However, as dicussed above, this is not in line with current social objectives or the social utility policy rationale, and is also not in line with the current jurisprudence of the common law. Rather, the covenant to pay and the covenant not to interfere with the leased space are mutually dependent covenants. ",2204,2891
732a8471-dca7-4b81-be0c-606cc6e86d0a," When Dana created the conveyance future interests were made. When looking at the device Dana uses the words ""provided that"" and ""so long as"" when conveying the property to Eve, this means that there could be some ambigouity when interpreting the conveyance. The phrase ""provided that"" indidcates that there is a condition that must be satisified for the future interest to be divested, this is known as a Fee Simple Subject to Conditional Subsequent (FSSCS). On the other hand, ""so long as"" indicates that there is a time requirment for the furure interst to be divested, this is known as a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD). Eve can have either a FSSCS or a FSD in the property. At the time of conveyance Dana has a possibility to reverter if Eve's interst is a FSD, or Dana has a power of termination if Eve's interest is a FSSCS. The rules of construction, which is typically supported by state statutes, favor the creation of a FSSCS over a FSD. It is important to note in the School Board Case where the court went against precedent and held that the ambigious conveyance created and FSD. Dana likely created a FSSCS when creating the conveyance. Assuming that Dana created a FSSCS or FSD, she would have a reversion in the property in the form of a power of termination or a possibility of reverter, respectively. However, Dana dies, leaving her interst on Earth. When looking at New Suffok General Laws it can be found that future interest are inheritable intestate and that if the property of a deceased person is not distributed according to a will or other intrument, then said property shall first be distributed to issue, then to ancestors, and then to collateral relatives. It is not mentioned in her will who get's the future interest of Blackacre. So, according to statute, Dana's issue, her daughter Fiona, would get the future interest. Eve could argue that Dana willed her personal property to Fiona but purposfully did not will her real property to Fiona. When seeking recovery of damages Fioana would look to the laws of waste. There are three types of waste: permissive, admissive, and economic. Permissive waste is when the neglect of property, like refusing to fix a leaky pipe. Admissive waste is the purposeful damage of the property, like tearing down a structure. Finally, ecomonimc waste is when the property could be worth more if it was used in a more useful manner. Here it is likely, that Eve allowed permissive waste to happen to the property. Eve neglagence roof shingles went missing, the left the state and failed to maintain the property. In2her windows borke and other problems developed. waste: permissive, admissive, and economic. Permissive waste is when the neglect of property, like refusing to fix a leaky pipe. Admissive waste is the purposeful damage of the property, like tearing down a structure. Finally, ecomonimc waste is when the property could be worth more if it was used in a more useful manner. Here it is likely, that Eve allowed permissive waste to happen to the property. Eve left the state and failed to maintain the property. In her neglagence roof shingles went missing, the windows borke and other problems developed. To try to sell the property, Eve could also try to argue that she has a Fee Simple Absolute in the property. Using the White case, where the plain language showed that the future interest was a life estate but the court held that it believed the intent was a fee simple absolute, Eve could claim that Dana left the country and had no intent to ever reclaim the property from eve. However, in the dissent of the White case it is argued that the grantor knew what she was writing because she gave all of her personal property away (in the FSA equivelent) to another party. Similarly here, Dana wills all of her personal property to her daughter Fiona. Finally, Eve could argue that by not selling the property that she is commiting economic waste. The developer offered Eve a significant sum of money. However, the court looks at more than financial gain when looking at economic waste. In the Mining Case, where the coal company tried to force the sale of the remaing family property instead of in kind, the court held that the family had a sentimental investment in the homestead and that too should be considered. Here Fioana has a sentimental attachment to the property, having grown up on the farm with her parents who are now dead. Perhaps Eve and Fiona could come to a compromise on the property. In The Farm House, case the future interest wanted to sell the property to prevent the economic waste but this would of divested the grandma's interest in the property, the court held that this would be unfair and allowed the grandma to reamain in the house, but also allowed the sale of the remaining property for economic development. Here Fiona could keep her interest in the property in the form of the house, but Eve could sell the remaining land to the developer. "," Peter runs a commercial enterprise out of the property that he is leasing from linda in a ""term of years."" However, since the construction started, Peter has been facing several inconvieniences with the property. If Peter were to abandon the property he would still be liable for the rent. Unless peter was able to prove that he was constructively evicted from the property. To be constructively evicted from the property, Peter would have to prove that Linda was in breach of Peter's Quiet enjoyment of the property. The factors to consider when trying to prove a breach of quiet enjoyment are (a) Linda's 2) Peter runs a commercial enterprise out of the property that he is leasing from linda in a ""term of years."" However, since the construction started, Peter has been facing several inconvieniences with the property. If Peter were to abandon the property he would still be liable for the rent. Unless peter was able to prove that he was constructively evicted from the property. To be constructively evicted from the property, Peter would have to prove that Linda was in breach of Peter's Quiet enjoyment of the property. The factors to consider when trying to prove a breach of quiet enjoyment are (a) Linda's actions took away significant use of the property; (b) the action was permanent; (c) that Peter awarded Linda a reasonable amount of time to correct the issue, and (d) that he actually left the property. (a) Peter could argue that the impairment of the back enterence and the parking lot takes away significant use of the property. This is similar to Echo, where echo argued that they would have to use the front enterance instead of the back enterance near there parking lot, the court held that these areas, according to the lease, were common right of access, and that Echo employees could still make it to the leased area because there was still an enterance. Here, Peter's lease describes the back enterance and parking lot as area's of common right of access. Moreover, Peter can still access from the store front on Main Street. Another argument, that Peter could make is that the dust and noise is taking away from his right to warranty to habitability. Yet, the court general does not allow this in leases where the property is being used commercially. Finally, Peter could argue that the infringment on his parking spot takes away a significant use of the property. This is similar to the Mass. Wall case, where the owner of the land built a wall that encroached a little bit on the leased property, and the court held that this was a constructive eviction. Here, Peter's designated parking spot is a prescirbed piece of the lease, and the encroachment on it could constitute an action that takes away significant use of the property from Peter. (b) Peter could argue that the construction has taken up a significant portion of his lease and that it has went on far longer than the period of time that Linda had told him. This is similar to Reste Real Estate, where the flooding was periodioc and depended on the weather, the court held that the causation of the flooding was permanent. Here, the construction on the property is continously being extended, Peter like the tenant in Reste have no idea when the end to the significant breach will happen. Yet, this is different than Echo, where Echo claimed that the noise of the construction was taking away from their queit enjoyment of the property, however the court held that this was all tentative on the construction which would eventually end. Here, we know that the construction is not indefinite and once the repairs are made the significant use of the property will be restored. (c) Peter could argue that he has given Linda a reasonable amount of time to correct the issues. Linda flooding was permanent. Here, the construction on the property is continously being extended, Peter like the tenant in Reste have no idea when the end to the significant breach will happen.

Here, we know that the construction is not indefinite and once the repairs are made the significant use of the property will be restored. (c) Peter could argue that he has given Linda a reasonable amount of time to correct the issues. Linda notified him that it would only take a couple weeks. After this period of time had passed, Peter called Linda and she acknowledge that it has taken longer than she expected. Weeks turned into months. This is different then Reste, where the tenant continouly asked the landlord to fix the property then left after a significant flood, the court held that even though the tenant never left after any of the minor flooding they could after a crowning blow. Here, Peter has not experienced a crowining blow. He has described the construction as an annoyance, but he is still able to use the property in a functional manner. (d) Peter would actually have to leave the property. Unlike a warrenty of habitability where the tenant could remain on the property. A constructive eviction requiers the tenant to leave. At this point, Peter is still on the property. Peter should, have money in his bank account to cover rent that he will miss if he moves out. He could attempt to get Linda into entering into a new lease at a lower rate that he finds more fair, or he can requests to surrender the lease to Linda. If Linda accepts a surrender, then the remaining term of the lease is null and void. However, if Linda refuses, his only option is to abandon the property and he would have to prove the constructive eviction. If the cuort finds that there was no constructive eviction then Peter will be responsible for his missed rent. Luckily, it is the landlords responsiblitiy to mitigate damages. Similiar to the Veteran who's wife left him unemplyed case, the land lord would try to sue for the amount of the whole lease even though other parties were interested int the proeprty, the court held that this is an unfair practice and that the previous tenatn was only responsible for a poriton of the rent due. Here, Linda would have to seek a new tenant and replace Peter as quickly as possible. Peter would only be respnsible for the rent due prior to the new tenant leasing the property. ",859,1118
4ef2af3a-05d9-4992-9746-a24945431d7b," Question 1: Dana's (D) conveyance of Blackacre appears to be an ambiguous conveyance based on both the conditional language in the conveyance ""provided that"" and the durational language in the conveyance ""so long as."" Conveyances that are created with condition language tend to be a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS) and conveyances created with durational language tend to be Fee Simple Determinable (FSD) (unless the future intetest is in a third party, which does not appear to apply here). To determine what type of conveyance was created with ambiguous language, we must look at the rules of construction which: attempt the achieve the intent of the grantor, favor Fee Simple Absolute over a life estate, avoid partial intestancy, free alienation of property, favor FSSCS over FSD, favor vested remainders over contingent remainders, and read the document as a whole. As in the White v. Brown case, the conveyance that was written made the majority of the court believe that the conveyance was ambiguous while the minority of the court believed that the language was clear and created a specific type of conveyance, and the court applied the rules of construction to make a determination on the conveyance, conversely in the Marentholz case, the court also went through a discussion on whether or not the conveyance was ambiguous, looked at the rules of construction, and decided that the conveyance was FSD and not FSSCS; however the court's decision in that case was jurisdiction specific and is an exception to the rule. Here the conveyance that D has written contains both FSSCS and FSD language, and when we apply the rules of construction, we can see that the majority of the courts (Marentholz as the exception), would favor the FSSCS language over the FSD language. If the courts conclude that the conveyance is an FSSCS then E would have Blackacre in a FSSCS, and D would retain a right of entry or power of termination. The condition subsequent in this conveyance is the ""so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house,"" which means that as soon as that condition is met, D would have the ability to step onto Blackacre, terminate the conveyance, and retake Blackacre. In this case, it does not appear that E has met the condition, although she received contact from a realtor that would like to make an offer on Blackacre, and has thought about seeing what other offers any steps to solicit more offers, however if E might be available, it does not appear that she has2taken does attemp to solicit offers for the Blackacre, it appears that she will have met the condition and has created the risk that she could lose Blackacre. the ""so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house,"" which means that as soon as that condition is met, D would have the ability to step onto Blackacre, terminate the conveyance, and retake Blackacre. In this case, it does not appear that E has met the condition, although she received contact from a realtor that would like to make an offer on Blackacre, and has thought about seeing what other offers might be available, it does not appear that she has taken any steps to solicit more offers, however if E does attemp to solicit offers for the Blackacre, it appears that she will have met the condition and has created the risk that she could lose Blackacre. Fiona may have a basis in reclaiming ownership of Blackacre because she potentially has a future interest in the property. When D died she conveyed all her personal property to Fiona (F), and we might be able to assume that F has become the admin of her estate upon her death. If we assume that is the case, then if E ever meets the condition set out in D's conveyance to her of Blackacre, then it would be F as the admin of D's estate that would have the ability to step onto Blackacre and retake the property from E. Since F may techincally have a future intrest in Blackacre, she might be able to use the Doctrine of Waste, which attempts to reconcile the present and future intertests of a property, to make a claim for Blackacre. As in the Woodrick v Wood case, where the daughter who had a future interest in the property wanted to stop her mother (present interest) from tearing down a barn on the property, the court looked at the doctrine of waste and tried to weigh the interests of both parties, here when F arrives at Blackacre she is shocked at the state the house is in, the roof shingles are missing, glass is cracked and there are other serious problems with the house, F may be able to claim that E allowed for permissive waste to occur on the property by not making repairs to the property and generally being negligent with her ownership of the property. If F is not considered to be the admin of D's estate though, then the potential doctrine of waste claim would not helpful for her because then she may not have a future interest in Blackacre and so the court would not be inclined to attempt to reconcile the two interests. However, E may also be able to use the dcotrine of waste as an argument for selling Blackacre by using Economic Waste as an argument. Economic waste can be used if a property is not being used to it's full potential or abilities. In the time that E has spent away from Blackacre, the economic value of the property has gone way up, which is illustrated in the offer that E receives from a local realtor. E may be abl to claim that the best way to use the economic value of Blackacre is to sell it, and that by not selling the property E would be allowing economic waste to occur because she isn't using the property to it's full abilities. When D created the conveyance, although she was ambiguous with creating either a FSSCS or an FSD, she did not appear to be ambiguous with her intention that Blackacre was not to be sold. If we go back full potential or abilities. In the time that E has spent away from Blackacre, the economic value of the property has gone way up, which is illustrated in the offer that E receives from a local realtor. E may be abl to claim that the best way to use the economic value of Blackacre is to sell it, and that by not selling the property E would be allowing economic waste to occur because she isn't using the property to it's full abilities. When D created the conveyance, although she was ambiguous with creating either a FSSCS or an FSD, she did not appear to be ambiguous with her intention that Blackacre was not to be sold. If we go back to the rule of construction; the court would want to read the doc as a whole and they would also want to attempt to achieve the intent of the grantor, and in this case D was fairly clear that she did not want E to attempt to sell the house, and that she did not want the house to be sold at all. Ultimately D's clear language around her intent to not have the house sold may be the language that is most detrimental to E's potential claim that she should be able to sell Blackacre. "," Peter (P) has a tenancy of years or a term lease that means that he is on the hook for the rent during the entirety of the lease, however P may meet the requirements for a breach in the convenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE). The CQE is an enjoyment that is implied in all leases, both residential and commercial, that gives the leasee or tenant a right of enjoyment of the property. A breach in the CQE can result in an actual eviction, a constructive eviction, or in damages. If proving a breach in CQE is not possible, then P could potentially try to find someone to take over the apartment via a sublease or an assignment. P may be able to claim a breach in CQE via actual eviction. An actual eviction can be either a partial or total dispossession of the tenant of the property, and something like a minor encroachment can lead to an actual eviction. As in the Smith (wagon) case, the landlord built a wall on the property that the tenant was leasing, the wall was not very large and was created to hold a wagon, the court held that the encroachment of the wall was a partial dispossession of the property and that the tenant coul claim that an actual eviction had occurred, here P has a designated parking spot, that was written into the lease, and during the construction the builders have encroached onto his parking space making it very difficult for him to use, and P may be able to say that the encroachment into the parking space is enough of a partial dispossession that could lead to a claim for actual eviction. However, Linda (L) may be able to argue against P's claim of actual eviction based on4 partial dispossession because technically P still has access to the parking spot and he can still use the parking spot even though it is a tight sqeeze, but the an actual eviction had occurred, here P has a designated parking spot, that was written into the lease, and during the construction the builders have encroached onto his parking space making it very difficult for him to use, and P may be able to say that the encroachment into the parking space is enough of a partial dispossession that could lead to a claim for actual eviction. However, Linda (L) may be able to argue against P's claim of actual eviction based on partial dispossession because technically P still has access to the parking spot and he can still use the parking spot even though it is a tight sqeeze, but the court may apply the Smith case and determine that any minor encroachment can lead to a partial dispossession and thus actual eviction. P may also be able to claim a breach in CQE via constructive eviction. A constructive eviction can occur if a landlord interferres with a tenants property, the interferrance is substantial, the tenant informed the landlord of the interferance, and the tenant abandoned the property. As in the Echo consulting case, the tenant was renting basement space from the bank and the bank started renovations on the bank upstairs, the renovations interferred with Echo's ability to use one of the doors to get into the building and were generally a nusance, the court held that Echo could not claim a defense of a breach of CQE through constructive eviction because the lease was not specific on what door Echo could use, and though ultimately the court broadened the terms of what CQE was, they did not make a decision in favor of Echo because the lease was not specific enough. Here there is also construction going on, and the construction is clearly a nusance to P and his shop, and potentially has even effected his business because pizza sales are down, and has made it difficult for P to bring his deliveries to the back of the store, but the lease might not be specific enough to give P the ability to claim constructive eviction. The lease states that P may have common right of access thereto, but does not specifically state that he will have unimpeeded access to the back door and the court may determine that because he continues to have access to the door and even has access to the front door, that he has not met the requirements for constructive eviction. Additionally P would also have to show that he notified the L of the interferrance and that he abandoned the property, in this case P has notified the landlord of the interferrance issues, he has been calling L every week to discuss the state of the construction, however P has, at least at this point, not abandoned the property. In order for P to even have a chance at a successful claim to constructive eviction, he would have to vacate the premises. Lastly, P may be able to claim a breach in the CQE via damages. P asserts that since the construction around the pizza shop began, he has seen a reduction in the number of customers coming to the shop and that his pizza revenue is down as well. If P can successfully link the drop in customers and revenue to the timing of the construction interferrance, than he may be able to make a claim on damages for the lost revenue and potential revenue. constructive eviction, he would have to vacate the premises. Lastly, P may be able to claim a breach in the CQE via damages. P asserts that since the construction around the pizza shop began, he has seen a reduction in the number of customers coming to the shop and that his pizza revenue is down as well. If P can successfully link the drop in customers and revenue to the timing of the construction interferrance, than he may be able to make a claim on damages for the lost revenue and potential revenue. If those options of a breach to the CQE are not available to P, he may be able to find someone to take over the lease as a sunleasee or as an assignment. A sublease would allow someone onto the property, but would it would not create privity between the subleasee and the landlord and in this situation, P would retain a reversion. An assignment would require that P give up all rights and future intetests to the property, it would create privity between the landlord and the assignee, and essentially means that the assignee ""steps into the shoes"" of the tenant and has all the rights. As in the dragway case, the original leasee of the property had someone else take over the lease and then that person stoped paying rent, the court went through a discussion about the differences between a sublease and an assignment and determines that ultimately it would make sense to try and determine what the intent between the parties was when they created the language to have the new person take over the lease. In this case, while P has not already attempted to find someone to take over the lease, it is an option available to him and it is likely advisible that if he were to attempt this that he attempt to create an assignment, or at least use language that would make it clear that the intent of the parties is that the person taking over the lease would be the person in privity with the landlord and taking the whole responsibility of the property. If all else fails, P could attempt to surrender the property through an agreement with the landlord that P voluntarity gives up his right to possess the property, or he could potentially abandon the property without the consent of the landlord, and stop maing rent payments. L could go after P for the missed rent payments and potential other damages, but the landlord would have to prove that they mitigate the damages, by attempting to re-lease or re-rent the property. As in the Sommers v Kridel case, where the incoming tenant wanted to break the lease because something changed in their life and they couldn't move to the new apartment anymore and had to abandon it, the court stated that the landlord had to at least attempt to fill the vacant apartment to mitigate damages, and that the landlord would own the burden of proving that they attempted to fill the vacant property. Here if P abandoned the property, although he would likely lose some money from missed rent payments if L filed a calim against him, he apartment sit for the remainder of the lease, and would at least know that L would not be able to let6 the that L would carry the burden of proving that she attempted to fill the vacant property. move to the new apartment anymore and had to abandon it, the court stated that the landlord had to at least attempt to fill the vacant apartment to mitigate damages, and that the landlord would own the burden of proving that they attempted to fill the vacant property.

0cfd3781-8b12-4e17-8d9d-16c15ce0f246," The first issue is what kind of interests were created by Dana's conveyance. Language that is durational in a conveyance, such as ""so long as"", creates a fee simple determinable (FSD). Language that is conditional on the other hand, such as ""provided that"", creates a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS). In this case, both types of language appear in the conveyance. This creates an ambiguous conveyance. Like in the ambiguous will case, the court ruled that the ambigous langauge should be read to favor a FSSCS over a FSD. This is because in a FSSCS, one party must act in order to retake the land if the condition is broken. This action is favored because it limits the grey area that may be created if one party does not act to retake the land. As a result, the conveyance made Eve's interest in Blackacre a FSSCS. In a FSSCS, if the condition is broken, the grantor has the right of entry/power of termination. At the time of the conveyance, Dana held this right of entry/power of termination, and upon Dana's death, Fiona became the inheritor of Dana's personal property, and took on the right of entry/power of termination if the condition is broken by Eve. The next issue is if there are any arguements that Eve could make that she should be permitted to solicit offers for the sale of blackacre? The idea of economic waste says that it is wasteful to not sell property is that sale would benefit all interest holders, both present and future. Under the conveyance, Eve was not permitted to sell the land. However, like in the case where the woman left her house to the daughter, on the condition that it not be sold, the idea of economic waste was used by the daughter as a defense to sell the home. The court ruled that this was a succesful defense because the monetary benefit of selling the home outweighed the benefits of not selling the home. Adding on to this point, in the Ark Land Co. case, where the family was divided on selling their interests in their land to the coal company, the court outlined factors that went into determing if a home should be partioned in sale or in kind. These factors included the economic value of the property, the sentimental attachment of the owners to the property, and the benefit to the public that would be created by selling the home. The court ruled that the economic value was self-served by Ark Land, and should not be the determinative factor in the decision to sell the land, and pointed to the family's attachment to the land as a reason that it should be partioned in kind. On the other hand, the dissent in this case believed that the family did not have an attachment to the home because most of them had already sold their interest to the coal company and they family only used the home for a few months out out of the year. In this case, the home is These factors included the economic value of the property, the sentimental attachment of the owners to the property, and the benefit to the public that would be created by selling the home. The court ruled that the economic value was self-served by Ark Land, and should not be the determinative factor in the decision to sell the land, and pointed to the family's attachment to the land as a reason that it should be partioned in kind. On the other hand, the dissent in this case believed that the family did not have an attachment to the home because most of them had already sold their interest to the coal company and they family only used the home for a few months out out of the year. In this case, the home is delapedated, with missing roof shingles and cracked glass, but has still appreciated in value because of its location in New Suffolk. A court will likely rule that it, as in the economic waste case, it would be more beneficial to all interest holders to sell the home than to keep it. Additionally, Eve has not lived it the home for five years, and Fiona has not lived in the home since sixteen years. Because both Fiona and Eve have not lived in the home for many years, they have not shown an interest or attachment to the property, and a court will likely rule that, as seen in the dissenting opinion of the Ark Land co. case, Eve and Fiona would not be at a disadvantage in selling it. The final issue is whether Fiona has any basis for reclaiming ownership and/or holding Eve accountable for the repairs need. Since Eve's interest in the land is in FSSCS, she is the owner of the land until she attempts to sell the home. At this time, the grantor has the right of entry a.k.a power of termination, to come in and reclaim the land. Since Dana has died, Fiona (her heir) inherits all of her personal property and becomes the executor of this property. Based on this, Fiona would have an argument in reclaiming ownership of the home as Eve had taken an offer to sell the land to a real estate developer. To do this, Fiona would need to go to the home and retake the land. On the other hand, Eve would argue that she only answered a phone call that happened to be from a developer who was interested in buying the land. Eve would argue that since the langauge of the conveyance reads, ""so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house. The house is not to be sold."", she did not violate the condition becasue she was not actively attempting to sell the home, nor did she actually sell it. A court will likely rule in favor of Eve. As the owner of the house in FSSCS, Eve was not able to attempt to sell the home, or actually sell it. Fiona, as Dana's surviving heir, has inherited all personal property from Dana. Under the idea of permissive waste, Fiona could argue that Eve is to be held accountable for the repairs needed. Eve's neglect in the home has led to its damages from the cold weather over the years. On the other hand, Eve could argue that, assuming she did not violate the condition of attempting to sell or actually selling the home, she is still the owner of the home and that Fiona has no interest in the home. On the other hand, Fiona would argue that as the inheritor of Dana's property, she now holds the right of entry/power of termination if the condition is broken. Therefore, she would have an interest in the home and the Fiona, as Dana's surviving heir, has inherited all personal property from Dana. Under the idea of permissive waste, Fiona could argue that Eve is to be held accountable for the repairs needed. Eve's neglect in the home has led to its damages from the cold weather over the years. On the other hand, Eve could argue that, assuming she did not violate the condition of attempting to sell or actually selling the home, she is still the owner of the home and that Fiona has no interest in the home. On the other hand, Fiona would argue that as the inheritor of Dana's property, she now holds the right of entry/power of termination if the condition is broken. Therefore, she would have an interest in the home and the permissive waste would be detreimental to her interest. A court will likely rule in favor of Fiona that, as the holder of the right of entry/power of termination, she has an interest in maintaining the home and under the idea of permissive waste she could hold Eve accountable for the repairs needed. This would back the policy rational of supporting the interests of all interest holders. "," The first issue is whether the scaffolding surrounding the rear entrance gives Peter a claim to partial actual eviction. Partial actual eviction occurs when a landlord restircts a tenants use of part of the land, which in fact restricts the tentants use of the entire land. In this case, the rear door of the shop provides easy access for customers and delivery drivers to come in and out of the shop. However, the scaffolding surrounding the rear entrance creates a ""maze"" that customers and delievery drivers must navigate, and limits the ability of delievery drivers to park near the door. Although not impossible, it is quite difficult for both parties to do these things. In the Echo Consulting case, where construction blocked an entrance to the bank, the bank sued for partial actual eviction, constructive eviction, and damages. The court held that the bank could collect for damages but not for the other two claims. They reasoned that, altough the construction proved to be a hardship on employees and customers, there was an alternative door that could be used. Additionally, the lease in that case did not provide that the bank would have access to a specific door. Similarly in this case, the lease provided ""common right of access thereto"" and did not specify a specific door. Additionally, unlike in Echo, the construction did not completely block access from the rear door, and did not block access at all from the front door. I would advise Peter that, as in Echo, he may be able to collect for damages. I would also advise him that Linda would argue that, because there are alternative entrances, and that the rear door is still accessible, he would not have a case for partial actual eviction, as was also seen in Echo. The next issue is whether the construction equipment encroaching on Peter's spot gives him a claim to actual partial actual eviction. As mentioned above, partial 6 eviction occurs when a landlord restircts a tenants use of part of the land, which in fact restricts the tentants use of the entire land. In this case, the lease provides that Peter is entitled to the use of ""one designated parking spot"". The construction would advise Peter that, as in Echo, he may be able to collect for damages. I would also advise him that Linda would argue that, because there are alternative entrances, and that the rear door is still accessible, he would not have a case for partial actual eviction, as was also seen in Echo. The next issue is whether the construction equipment encroaching on Peter's spot gives him a claim to partial actual eviction. As mentioned above, partial actual eviction occurs when a landlord restircts a tenants use of part of the land, which in fact restricts the tentants use of the entire land. In this case, the lease provides that Peter is entitled to the use of ""one designated parking spot"". The construction equipment encroaches over the white line into his parking spot. In the Smith v. McCennany case, the landlord allowed a wall to be built that encroached slightly onto McCennany's land. The court held that this was partial actual evicition because the encroachment onto part of the land restricted McCeannany's use of all of the land. This is similar to Peter's situation because the construction equipment encroached only slightly onto his designated spot, which was garunteed in the lease. I would advise Peter that, as with the wall in Smith v. McCennany, the encoroachment into his spot amounted to partial actual eviction and that he would have a claim against Linda to collect damages or to seek a new spot. In this claim, Linda would argue that his spot is still useable and the fact that Peter has continued to park there shows that the the encroachment did not violate the terms of the lease: that Peter is entitled to ""one designated parking spot."". The final issue is whether Peter has a claim to constructive eviciton. In order to claim constructive eviction, a tenant must prove 1) a substantial intereferene with the use of their property, 2) notifty the landlord of this intereference and intent to leave, and 3) allow proper time for the landlord to remedy the situation before leaving. As seen in the Reste Realty case, the tenants held meetings in the basement of the building. Every time it rained, their meeting area would flood and damage their leased space and equipment. The court held that they had a succsesful claim for constructive eviction because they met all three elements: the flooding each time it rained proved to be a substantial interference, they notified the landlord, and they gave time for the situation to be fixed before leaving the space. In this case, Peter would have successfully notified the landlord of the intereference, but not of his intent to leave (which requires six months notice in a term of years lease), and, assuming that he did leave, would have given proper time for the landlord to remedy the situation. However, unlike in Reste Realty, the issues at the pizza shop do not amount to a substantial interference. Unlike in Reste Realty, where the intereference was continuous because the basement would flood every time it rained, the construction in this case was not continuous. It was taking longer than expected, but at some point the construction would end and in the mean time customers and employees could still use the rear door and the front door. Additionally, the encroachment into Peter's parking spot would not be a substantial intereference because Peter is still able to park in his spot, and if need be, could get a new designated parking spot proper time for the landlord to remedy the situation. However, unlike in Reste Realty, the issues at the pizza shop do not amount to a substantial interference. Unlike in Reste Realty, where the intereference was continuous because the basement would flood every time it rained, the construction in this case was not continuous. It was taking longer than expected, but at some point the construction would end and in the mean time customers and employees could still use the rear door and the front door. Additionally, the encroachment into Peter's parking spot would not be a substantial intereference because Peter is still able to park in his spot, and if need be, could get a new designated parking spot until the construction is complete. On the other hand, Peter could argue that his declining revenues as a result of the hardships caused by the construction could rise to the level of a substantial intereference. I would still adivse Peter that he did not have a claim to constructive evicition. ",1337,1122
5ff59384-3107-4171-bd9f-1b3d42c95b94," Eve - ambiguous interest either Fee simple subject to condition subsequent or fee simple subject to determinable If not ambiguous, Eve would have Fee simple absolute. Fiona - ambiguous has either possibility of reverter under FSSCS or power of termination/ right of re- entry under FSD If not ambiguous, Fiona has nothing. Dana's conveyance to Eve may be interpreted as fee simple absolute, since she used ambiguous language, ""ONLY"", as well as the conditional and limitation/durational language to not sell the home, like in the old house case. In the Old house case, the court was motivated by the rules of construction favoring fee simple absolute above all, as well as free alienabilty. Since Dana limited the sell of the home, the court will likely dismiss this claim and grant Eve a present interest in FSA with no reversions, following the ruling in the Old house case. However Dana left Fiona all her personal property in her will, meaning she knew how to convey a gift using clear language, like in the dissent of the Old house case. The dissenting judge in the old house case was similarly motivated by the rules of construction, however, when they looked to the document as a whole they recognized the clear language of the grantor and interpreted their intent to be unambiguous. The court here may consider that Eve may be permitted to solicit offers for the sell of the proeprty since she has present interest in FSA, with no future interest in grantors or grantees. However, Fiona may have an interest in reclaiming ownership if the conveyance given to Eve is interpreted as ambiguous since Dana used conditional and durational language, that may convey a fee simple subject to consdition subsequnt or a fee simple determinable. Fiona would have a future interest as possibility of reverter according to the rules of construction favoring FSSCS over FSD. In this instance, Eve may only sell the property if she consults with the future interest holder, Fiona. However, the court may conclude since the future interests of possibility of reverter lies with Fiona, who has no interest in the property, they should favor FSD over FSSCS, like in the School case. In the school case, the court decided to hold in favor FSD over FSSCS, contrary to the rules of construction due to the simple subject to consdition subsequnt or a fee simple determinable. Fiona would have a future interest as possibility of reverter according to the rules of construction favoring FSSCS over FSD. In this instance, Eve may only sell the property if she consults with the future interest holder, Fiona. However, the court may conclude since the future interests of possibility of reverter lies with Fiona, who has no interest in the property, they should favor FSD over FSSCS, like in the School case. In the school case, the court decided to hold in favor FSD over FSSCS, contrary to the rules of construction due to the policy rationale of making the best use of the property. In this view, Eve may remain the holder of blackacre and Fiona may not execerise power to terminate or re-enter. Fiona may hold Eve accoutnable for the repairs of Blackacre since she has violated her duties as a present interest holder, like in the case of the Old Barn. In the Old barn case the court was motivated by the doctrine of waste. Eve violated the doctrine of waste by commiting permissive waste since she has been neglectful in her duties to preserve the land as a present interest holder for future interst holders. In the old barn case, they look to the common law and modern view of waste. According to the common law, Eve's permissive waste of the property has made her liable for the destruction of it since she has damaged it for future interest holders, altering the state of the land. Looking to the modern rule, Eve may still be liable for repairs since she has not made any changes to the land that has increased its value, i.e. ameliorative waste. In conclusion, Eve may not consider selling the property without consulting Fiona first since she has a future interest in blackacre. However, we may consider that if she does sell the preoprty it may be in the best interest of both parties, which is considered in the ruling of the the Old barn case and the Old Widow case. In the old barn case, the court reasoned that tearing down the old barn would be in the best interest of all parties. Similarly, in the old lady case, the court considered the best interest of all parties, considering that the old widow be left with nothing if she did not sell the property, but reaching the conclusion that keeping the property would be best for the future interest holders. "," Peter, the tenant, has a term of years lease with the landlord ""LL"", Linda. Strengths: Peter may claim that the LL has breached his convenant of quiet enjoyment to the leased property. The construction of the building while temporary has remained a continued nuisance, cost him business, and substantially interefered with his property; like in the Flooding case. The court reasoned in the flooding case that while the flooding of the basement office could be temporary it had not been dealt with in a timely manner, therefore the LL had breached CQE through constructive eviction. A constructive eviction requires that the tenant have a substantial intereferance in the leased property, he must notify the LL and if the LL does not fix the issue within a reasonable amount of time, the tenant may leave within a reasonable amount of time and/ or stop paying rent. Tenant may also make a constructive eviction claim since the obstruction of the door has been limited his use of it and it is not ""common use"" as the lease required, like in the Bank Door case. In the bank door case the tenants claimed their use of the door was limited during the construction of the building causing a constructive eviction. The court here may view that the obstruction of the door at a pizza shop differs from the tenants in the Bank case since they don't expect many customers. However, as the ruling of the Bank door case determined, this arguement may harm tenant's claim of constructive eviction, since he was sitll able to use the front door and the back door was not completely blocked off from use. Furthermore, tenant may claim actual eviction of the parking lot, since they have partially taken up the lot, even going as far as to encroach on his designated parking space like we saw in the Brick wall case. In the Brick wall case, the court was moved by the rationale of the majority view, that if there is any encroachment on your leased property and you're paying rent for the whole, entire property -- you should stop paying rent. If we consider the minority view regarding actual eviction, if there is encroachment on your property, tenant may consider renegotiating your terms of the lease with the LL. Tenant's designated spot and common use of the lot is explicitly stated in the lease, therefore we may consider actual eviction. Weaknesses: Peter should not raise any claim that LL breached his convenant of quiet enjoyment. Although the should stop paying rent. If we consider the minority view regarding actual eviction, if there is encroachment on your property, tenant may consider renegotiating your terms of the lease with the LL. Tenant's designated spot and common use of the lot is explicitly stated in the lease, therefore we may consider actual eviction. Weaknesses: Peter should not raise any claim that LL breached his convenant of quiet enjoyment. Although the construction is of nuisance the pizza shop is fully opertable and as we saw in the Bank Door case construction is temporary and does not call for a constructive eviction. The court in Bank door was motivated by favoring damages to fix the issue rather than claiming an actual eviction occured when the bank was still fully opertable. Here tenant may seek similar relied. The construction has not substiantially interferred with the tenant's use since there was no crowning blow that has occured that may cause tenant to move out without paying rent; contrary to the finding in the flooding case. The court in the flooding case reasoned that the crowning blow was the last straw regarding the LL's inteterferance with the tenant's use of the leased proeprty; the LL had breach the CQE and tenant was right in moving out and stopping his rent payments. The case at hand is not as severe. Tenant although disturbed by the encroachment on his parking space it is very minor and does not call for an actual eviction since he can still park there ""tightly"". As we saw in the brick wall case, the LL had taken up more than a minor portion of the space. In the case at hand the enroachment is so minor that tenant may still park in the space without major interruption. Futhermore, after tenant had informed LL about his concerns, she was sympathetic and deducted moeny from his rent, following the minority view previously mentioned in the brick wall case. Linda may raise argument that while consruction is temporary, she recognizes the dustrubance and will follow the minority view in deduction from the rent. In conclusion, LL was not in breach of CQE through actual or constructive eviction. However, Peter should raise a claim for at least damages in his breach of CQE. As previously stated, the court ruled in the bank door case that although the intereferance was not subtantial enough the tenant was entitled to at least damages. The case at hand calls for the same action. Peter may seek out compensation since the obstruction has caused him loss in business and the court shall charge the LL 1$ in other damages to assure that LL makes efforts towards ending any intereference soon. No other damages are to be collected. the bank door case that although the intereferance was not subtantial enough the tenant was entitled to at least damages.

dd7e218b-35cd-4bf5-8d59-b16e32253638," Esay 1 In conveying Blackacre to her cousin, Eve, Dana has made some errors in her legal writing that will need to be discussed. The first issue to determine is whether Dana conveyed a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (""FSSCS,"") or whether she conveyed a Fee Simple Dterminable (""FSD""). While it would be important to determine if she meant to construe a life estate or FSA if the language suggested, there is no language that would indicate an ambiguity as to if it was a duration of her life, or whether she meant to convey it absolutely, and she utilized language that is both in line to trigger a FSD and a FSSCS, which indicates a duration or a condition respectively. The FSD is generally created by language like: ""so long as,"" ""until,"" ""while,"" and ""during. The FSSCS however, is generally created using language like"" ""but if,"" ""on the condition that,"" and ""provided that."" Courts historically have preferred a FSSCS, because of its accompanying future interest, the Right of Entry/Possibility of Termination. This is because this type of future interest requires that the party with the ROE/POT actually enter and takes the property upon the trigger of the condition subsequent, whereas the Possibility of Reverter that accompanies a FSD takes action right away, and the court wants to ensure that the land goes to individuals who use the land productively. A POR that takes palce right away keeps the option open that someone who will not use the land or who has no interest in it could become the present holder, which the court and public policy disapprove of. Language that is ambiguous has been held to be a FSD in Marenholz, however this was because in the state, future interests were not transferrable inter-vivos, so the court held that the language supported a FSD. However, courts have historically preferred, and the rules of construction state that a FSSCS is preferred over a FSD. The court will also look to the intent of the individual when a will is executed, try to avoid partial intestacy, and try to interpret the will as a whole. In the present case, Dana's conveyance was in the following language: ""I hereby convey Blackacre to my cousin, Eve, provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house. The house is not to be sold."" Dana has utilied both language that triggers a FSD and a FSD. It can be argued that the language ""so long as"" denotes a time of duration, 9 thus This is like the court in Marenholz, where and there was language that was ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways. Thus, it can be argued that like in Marenholz, she conveyed a FSD. However in the present case, unlike in Mareholz, and try to interpret the will as a whole. In the present case, Dana's conveyance was in the following language: ""I hereby convey Blackacre to my cousin, Eve, provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house. The house is not to be sold."" Dana has utilied both language that triggers a FSD and a FSD. It can be argued that the language ""so long as"" denotes a time of duration, and thus This is like the court in Marenholz, where there was language that was ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways. Thus, it can be argued that like in Marenholz, she conveyed a FSD. However in the present case, unlike in Mareholz, this Jurisidction allows the transfer of future interests inter vivos. As that was key reason in which the court held that the conveyance to be a FSD, it supports a notion that it should be in FSSC. As Marenholz is considered the exception to the rule regarding FSSCS over FSD, it is likely that the court will rule that she conveyed a FSSCS. Further, the rules of construction outline that a FSSCS should be favored when language is ambiguous. An issue that she may run into, however, regardless of the type of conveyance, there is no person listed who is the future interest holder for the conveyance. This is something a court would need to interpret using the rules of construction because the will was ambiguous. However, because she does leave her personal property to Fiona, her daughter, a court may be able to assert that she would be the holder of the future interest, and who would inherit if Eve tries to sell the property. The next issue to determine is whether Eve is allowed to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre. The conveyance reads: ""provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house."" While this is clear that her intent was to not sell the house, courts have had a home sold after a home was conveyed using similar kinds of language, like in White v. Brown. The court had already sold the home, despite the appeals court later determining that the home was conveyed in FSA. Additionally, a tenant has a duty not to commit waste while on a property for which there is a future interest, because policy wants to give the land to the individual in the same way that they found it. Waste can be permissive (negligent), affirmative (requiring an actual affirmative act on the part of the land holder), Ameliorative (increasing the value), or economic (not using land in a productive way). Further, the court in Arkland held that sentimental factors may be utilized when determining whether a sale is proper, and economic factors are not the deciding factor that must be utilized when determining a partition via sale. While this is not as relevant because it pertains to property that is held as co-tenants, it may be something that either Eve or Fiona can argue as to why Fiona should or should not be allowed to solicit offers from prospective buyers. The arguments for Eve being able to solicit sales in the property have their best basis in the notion of economic waste, and that while codified in the rules of construction, courts have looked to areas economic factors are not the deciding factor that must be utilized when determining a partition via sale. While this is not as relevant because it pertains to property that is held as co-tenants, it may be something that either Eve or Fiona can argue as to why Fiona should or should not be allowed to solicit offers from prospective buyers. The arguments for Eve being able to solicit sales in the property have their best basis in the notion of economic waste, and that while codified in the rules of construction, courts have looked to areas other than intent. Firstly, this case is very similar to White v, Brown, only that the conveyane is not a FSA or a LE but a FSD or a FSSC. Eve can argue using similar logic as the lower court in White. The court held that because it was a life estate, the home could be sold. Using similar logic, while there is no life estate here, she can argue that because there was no person named after her in terms of her conveyance, regardless of the type of conveyance it is, she should be able to solicit offers because there is noone to take the property from her if she does so. Further, she can argue that after hearing the high price that an individual would be willing to pay for Blackacre, she should be able to solicit offers for Blackacre because not doing so would be committing economic waste, as she would not be allowing herself to get money for the property which she does not use anymore. Further, because she moved off the property, allowing it not to be sold with noone living on it and caring for it and the upkeep of the home would be permissive waste, as well as economic waste because now noone would be using the land productively, which policy does favor. It also could be argued that she would commit affirmative waste when she moved off the property and had not sold the home to anyone to care for the it. Lasty, and a strecth, she could argue that the sentimental implications of staying on the home should allow her to do so, although this is not as strong because the case law pertains to co-tenants and not this type of conveyance. The arguments that Fiona can make against her soliciting the offers are rooted in the rules of construction and the appeals court's decision in Baker. Firstly, and most importantly she can assert that soliciting the sale of the home would violate the conveyance outright, which would divest her of the property. Secondly, Fiona can assert that the rule of construction via intent applies here, and that based on the conveyance, a court should issue an injunction barring her from soliciting further offers. This is like in White, where the appeals court held that the language of the conveyance indicated that the home not be sold and should stay within the family. Furhter, based on the rules of construction, wills should be conveyed to try and execute the whole, and avoid partial intestacy. Further, Fiona could assert a claim like the court held in White, and assert that bc the conveyance is ambiguous to the future holder, she should be given the interest, beause she was given the personal property of her mom, like the daughter in White. She could also argue that if the court deems her to be the future interest holder, on the conveyance, a court should issue an injunction barring her from soliciting further offers. This is like in White, where the appeals court held that the language of the conveyance indicated that the home not be sold and should stay within the family. Furhter, based on the rules of construction, wills should be conveyed to try and execute the whole, and avoid partial intestacy. Further, Fiona could assert a claim like the court held in White, and assert that bc the conveyance is ambiguous to the future holder, she should be given the interest, beause she was given the personal property of her mom, like the daughter in White. She could also argue that if the court deems her to be the future interest holder, because a sale would benefit Eve and not her, she would be wronged financilly. Lastly, and a stretch for the same reasons outlined in why it would be for Eve, Fiona could argue that she grew up there and so did Eve, and each of them have sentimental value. Lastly, the next issue to determine is whether Fiona has any basis for asserting a claim to come back to Blackacre. When someone dies and their will is ambiguous courts will try to not have the will be executed partially intestate. Courts will normally look to the heirs of the testator if there is no future interest or if it is ambiguous. Additionaly, they will look to others in the will, like heirs, to see if it is reasonabe that they could have intended it to go to them to inheit. Further, a tenant is not supposed to commit waste. While joint tenant and co-tenants have to reimburse each other for waste, when land does not have a future interest holder, the law provides no obligation for recovery of damages. In the present case, the will is ambiguous as to who the property will go to if the FSSCS conditon is violated. Thus, Fiona in that case, she can assert that because Dana left her all her other personal property, and is her heir, she can argue that she should be the executory interest, whic would chnage the categoriation to a FSS executory limitation.Further, she can also claim that she should get the property beause Eve committed waste. Fiona can argue that is is clear that she did do so (see rules re waste in above paragraph). It can be argued that she left the property after Dana died, leaving the property to decay and go to disarray, and thus, the court should hold that the property should go to Fiona, Dana's heir, who will use the property productively. However, she likely will not be able to recover damages because she was not the future interest holder. Eve can argue that she took efforts to not commit waste when she paid the taxes online. Thus would be her way of arguing against economic waste, but it is a weak one. She can also claim that she did not solicit the sale initially, and thus she did not break the covenant. "," Essay 2 The first issue to determine is whether Peter will be able to assert an actual eviction. Actual evictions arise when the landlord disposseses the tenant from the entirety of the property, or when they disposses them of a part of their property, such that the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment has been breached. This is, of course, unless the lease expressly waived the CQE or excluded it . Courts assert an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in residential and commercial leases because they wanted to afford more rights to tenants to enjoy their property. Further, Holmes stated that when you rent a property, you rent the whole, and such a dispossession of the parts counts as a dispossession of the whole. To assert an actual eviction, you must give notice to your landlord, and then abandon the premises. In the present case of Peter, Peter can argue that his landlord actually evicted him, because she dispossesed him of a part of his store via the construction scaffolding, and she dispossesed him of his parking space he gets via the lease, due to the equipment encroaching onto the space. He would assert that the mdispossession from his whole store consttutes a breach of the CQE. Furtherm he would argue the minor encroachment on the spot are both like the wall in Smith, and thus her encroachment actually evicted him. However, Linda will likely assert the defenses that the court held to valid in Echo, and assert that because the construction is temporary, and the effects leading to the actual eviction are temporary, there was no permanent partial eviction, ar actual eviction. The spot's encroachment is small, but he can still park there, and he can park in the common lot. The scaffolding is inconvenient, but it is only temporary, and not like the wall that was considered to be a partial eviction in Smith. Next, it must be determined what to do in the event that his actual eviction claim fails! As history went on the courts began to broaden the concept of the covenant of quiet enjoyment for residential and commercial leases, where they asserted that a substantial interference can breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment such that it can amount to a constructive eviction. A constructive eviction occurs when there is a substantial interference that prevents the tenant from being able to enjoy their premises to its fullest potential. In order to assert a CE based on a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the tenant must spot a substantial interference. In residential leases, courts have held situations like clogged sewage pipes, rodent infestations, and lack of hot water in6the winter, to constitute breaches ofthe covenant of quiet enjoyment that woud warrant a constructive eviction. In a commercial lease, the court held in Reste Realty that flooding that was due to a landlord's failure to continually mitigate the flooding issue enjoyment such that it can amount to a constructive eviction. A constructive eviction occurs when there is a substantial interference that prevents the tenant from being able to enjoy their premises to its fullest potential. In order to assert a CE based on a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the tenant must spot a substantial interference. In residential leases, courts have held situations like clogged sewage pipes, rodent infestations, and lack of hot water in the winter, to constitute breaches ofthe covenant of quiet enjoyment that woud warrant a constructive eviction. In a commercial lease, the court held in Reste Realty that flooding that was due to a landlord's failure to continually mitigate the flooding issue rose to the level that constituted a breach in the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Things like being dispossesed from a door when other doors were common in the lease, or temporary noise due to construction, to not constitute a Constructive eviction. However, in Echo, the court did feel like the covenant of quiet enjoyment had been breached but not to the level that rose to a CE. Next, the tenant must inform the landlord of the breach, and provide the landlord reasonable time to fix the inform the landlord of the substantial interference, and the tenant must allow reasonable time for the LL to fix the issue. After a reasoable time, the tenant may leave the premises and discontinue paying rent. This reflects the modern approach to leases, in that they are more like contracts and have dependent covenants to each other--rent for possession and QE. CE is risky to assert, however, bc if the court determines that your situation is not a CE, you are liable for the rest of your rent, and you may have your lease terminated at the LL's discretion, and be liable for the remainder. The policy rationale behind this is to keep the landlord and tenant on an equal playing field, but provide rights for the tenant in the event that there is such an issue where their usage becomes interfered with. It also promotes tenants rights and confidence in the legal system. In the present case, Peter can make many arguments that his situation constitutes a Constructive Eviction. The first two arguments are weaker, because they employ logic from Echo Consulting, where the court held that there was no contructive eviction. Peter may assert that, like in Echo where there was a block in the access to the main door, he has been constructively evicted because he uses the back door to make deliveries, and customers use it to park in the lot. Further, he can argue that the encroachment on his parking space does not allow him to park there, and that it deprives him of something that is common to him in the lease, exclusive use of one parking spot. However, these are weaker arguments. The court held in Echo that because there was another door for the tenants to use, and the noise was temporary, there was no constructive eviciton. Linda will argue that he can still use his spot even though it is a tight squeeze and that it is only temporary, like the noise in Echo, and thus he has not been dispossessed of something common 7toofhim 9 in his lease; further, using the logic in echo, she can argue that there is another lot that is common to his lease that he may park in. Additionally, she will make a similar argument regardgint the door, and argue that becuse there is a building entrance that something that is common to him in the lease, exclusive use of one parking spot. However, these are weaker arguments. The court held in Echo that because there was another door for the tenants to use, and the noise was temporary, there was no constructive eviciton. Linda will argue that he can still use his spot even though it is a tight squeeze and that it is only temporary, like the noise in Echo, and thus he has not been dispossessed of something common to him in his lease; further, using the logic in echo, she can argue that there is another lot that is common to his lease that he may park in. Additionally, she will make a similar argument regardgint the door, and argue that becuse there is a building entrance that is common in the lease -- the one on main street, he has not been dispossesed of someting common. However, his best argument is regarding the lack of revenue. This arguent is similar to Reste Realty, where despite repeated attempts to mitigate the flooding the flooding continued, such to a degree that after one storm they had to move a meeting to another spot, and were unable to condct businss in the leased premises. In the present case, the ongoing construction has caused customers to not enter as frequently, deliveries to become less efficient which makes his business less efficient overall, and most importantly, a decline in revenue to an otherwise successful pizzashop (he has continued to renew his lease). Peter can argue that his notice to the LL about the issues, and the continuance of the problems-- her inability to solve the issue. evidenced by the ongoing construction, despite her sympathy, has caused him to lose money and ultimately has substantially interfered with his ability to use the premises for the intention in which he leased it for--to run a pizza shop. Thus, due to the days becoming weeks and months, he has arguably given a reasonable time, and can abandon the premises. While Linda will likely argue that she took $ f of his rent, this does not mitigate the problem, because the issue still remains, and unless he is only losing $100 a month in revenue, it is an insufficient fix to the problem. Linda can also assert that the loss of revenue is due to his closing the week of the beginning of the construction, but that is not stated in the facts nor proven. Further, she can argue that the construction is delayed due to no fault of her own, but because he can no longer run his business in the way he intended to before the construction, which is definitely a SI, this will likely be rejected. Linda could have protected herself from this by expressly stating that she is able to do construction during the lease and he cannot claim a CE, but she did not. Thus, it is likely that a court will hold that he has been constructively evicted due to the SI. There is no IWOH for commercial leases, so he cannot assert a IWOH claim. ",2127,1600
92054fa1-a5d5-48c4-b5f7-f918a9fc348d," 1) In determining the property interests that Dana left to Eve, it has to be determined what present and future interests there are. In this conveyance of property, there is ambiguous language because it used both conditional and durational language. If it was a fee simple determinable, there would be a possibility of reverter in fee simple absolute (FSA) to Dana, and therefore to Fiona since she is Dana's heir and issue and Dana is dead. However, if it was a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS), Dana (and her heirs since she is now dead and Fiona is her only heir) would have a right of entry/power of termination in FSA. In the rules of construction for conveyance for property, a FSSCS is prefered over a fee simple determinable because it allows the grantor to take back the land if they so choose, and it is not an automatic reversion like in a fee simple determinable. This rule of construction for conveyance of property differs from the school case where the court ruled the conveyance to be a fee simple determinable instead of a FSSCS, but that was because the language specifically said that the property would revert back to the grantor. It is likely that the court will use the rules of construction for property conveyance and dictate the conveyance to be a FSSCS with the right of entry/power of termination in FSA due to the nature of not having an automatic reversion. The next issue is if Eve is able to sell the property. The property conveyance specifically states that Eve has the property as long as and provided that she does not attempt to sell the house and that the house is not to be sold. It is important to look at the grantor's intent when giving the property under the rules of construction, and Dana most likely wanted the house to stay in the family. This case is similar to the White v. Brown case where the court had to look at the intent of the grantor and used the rules of construction to determine it was a fee simple ablsolute with a constraint on alienation. Here, the court would also look at the intent of the grantor and go by the rules of construction to see if Dana's intent was for the house to stay in the family. The policy rational would be that it is more likey for the interest holder to make improvements on the land and use its full economic capacity because the house couldn't be sold. However, Eve could maybe try to argue that she did not attempt to sell the property, but rather someone recieves a phone call saying that a real estate came to her to buy the property. In this situation, 2Eve developer recieved her contact information and she wanted to make Eve an offer on the house. Eve did not explicitly attempt to reach out to the real estate developer, but rather the developer reached out to was for the house to stay in the family. The policy rational would be that it is more likey for the interest holder to make improvements on the land and use its full economic capacity because the house couldn't be sold. However, Eve could maybe try to argue that she did not attempt to sell the property, but rather someone came to her to buy the property. In this situation, Eve recieves a phone call saying that a real estate developer recieved her contact information and she wanted to make Eve an offer on the house. Eve did not explicitly attempt to reach out to the real estate developer, but rather the developer reached out to her. However, it is important to look at Dana's intent, and she likley wanted the house to stay in the family. If this attempt does go against the conveyance, Fiona would be able to reenter the property and terminate Eve's interest because Eve had a FSSCS. In that situation, Fiona would now hold the property in a fee simple absolute and would have an unlimited property interest and no one could divest her of the property. However, if it is determined that this was not an attempt because Eve did not reach out to the developer, and Eve did attempt to get other bids on the property, that would definitely satisfy attempting to sell the house. Fiona would be able to reenter and terminate Eve's interest because it would go to Fiona since Dana is no longer alive and Fiona is Dana's issue and heir. The next issue is if Fiona has a basis for reclaiming ownership and for holding Eve accountable for the repairs needed for Blackacre. If it is determined that Eve attempted to sell the property and Fiona reentered and terminated Eve's interest, Fiona would be the new owner of the property in FSA. Since there is both a present interest holder (Eve) and a future interest holder (Fiona), this relationship goes directly to the issue of waste becasue a present interest holder is supposed to convey to a future interest holder the premises in virtually the same conditions as the present interest holder recieved it in. There are 4 types of waste: affirmative, permissive, ameliorative, and economic. Affirmative waste happens when someone voluntarily injures the property to decrease its value, permissive waste happens when someone is negligent and doesn't make reasonable repairs to maintain the property, ameliorative waste happens when someone voluntarily makes improvements to the property to increase its value (this is usually not considered waste in the US), and economic waste occurs when the property is not being used to its best economic capacity. When there are present and future interests, it is important for the present interest holder to not commit waste on the property to protect the interest and right of the future interest holder. Since Dana is dead, Fiona would be the future interest holder having a right of reentry and termination of power in fee simple absolute. Fiona could argue that Eve committed permissive waste by locking the doors and ignoring/neglecting the property for 5 years which leads to the house being is wreck; there are roof shingles missing, glass is cracked, and other serious problems. It can also maybe be seen as affirmative waste because she voluntarily locks the door leading the house to be used to its best economic capacity. When there are present and future interests, it is important for the present interest holder to not commit waste on the property to protect the interest and right of the future interest holder. Since Dana is dead, Fiona would be the future interest holder having a right of reentry and termination of power in fee simple absolute. Fiona could argue that Eve committed permissive waste by locking the doors and ignoring/neglecting the property for 5 years which leads to the house being is wreck; there are roof shingles missing, glass is cracked, and other serious problems. It can also maybe be seen as affirmative waste because she voluntarily locks the door leading the house to be in disrepair. There is no ameliorative waste because the property has not gone up in value by Eve locking the door, and there is economic waste because the property is in disrepair and would likely be worth more if the house was in better shape than it is in currently; it is not using the land to its best capacity. If it is determined that Eve committed waste to the property and she is no longer an interest holder in the property, Eve would likley owe Fiona damage money to make repairs due to Fiona now having the property in FSA. In the case where the highway was coming to the area making the property go up in value, there was a disjunction between the present and future interest holder, just as there is here, because the present wanted to sell the house, and the future holder did not want to sell the house because it was expected to go up in value. Here, Fiona feels sentimental about Blackacre and wants to move back, showing that she wants to keep the house. If Eve could sell the property to the real estate developer becuase it was not seen as her attempting to sell it and she gets to keep her present property interest, Fiona, the future interest holder would not want the sale. In that case, it was determined that deterioration and waste is not the only factor in determining the sale of a property; the court also has to look at what is best for both present and future interest holders. Here, since Fiona does not want a sale, and because it most likely goes against the grantors intent, the sale would not be allowed. However, Eve could potentially argue that it would be economic waste to not sell the house because the land is worth a lot of money, and more if the house wasnt there (if it is determined that she can sell it because she did not attempt to sell it, allowing her to keep her property interest). In the case of Woodrick v. Wood, the present interest holder wanted to remove the barn, and the future interes holder wanted the barn to stay. The court determined that improvements that make the property go up in price do not constitute waste becasue it is increasing the value of the property. Here, Eve could try to argue that it is better to sell the house because there would be improvements on the property due to the state of disrepair the house is currently in. It is also better for the economy to put the land to better use than a house that is in wreck and no one has lived in the house for years. However, that would only be allowed if it was determined that the developer reaching out to her was not an attempt for her to sell the house and she still holds a present interest in the property. wanted the barn to stay. The court determined that improvements that make the property go up in price do not constitute waste becasue it is increasing the value of the property.

However, that would only be allowed if it was determined that the developer reaching out to her was not an attempt for her to sell the house and she still holds a present interest in the property. "," The issue here is if he can get out of his lease early. Here, it would be important to look at the terms of the lease and if the landlord specifically breached one of those terms because then Peter can automatically exit the lease. Here, there was common access to entering the building and he still is able to get in the front door, and the back door although difficult, and he still has the 2000 square feet of floor area, and the common use of the parking lot. The only element that could be seen as a breach of the terms is the designated parking spot because the construction equipment does encroach on his designated parking spot by going over the white line into his space. However, he can still park there although it is a tight sqeeze. Thus, there most likely is not a breach in the terms of the contract to automatically allow Peter to exit the lease. In order to see if Peter can get out of the lease, the court will look at if the landlord breached his covenant of quiet enjoyment (CQE). Here, implied warrant of habitability cannot be breached because it is a commercial lease, not a residential. To breach the CQE, the landlord has to interfere with the beneficial use of the premises and the tenents enjoyment with the premises. If the landlord does breach the CQE, there are 3 remedies: actual eviction if dispossesed from a portion or the total of the premises, constructive eviction if the landlord's interference is so substancial that the tenant feels like they have been dispossesed of the premises (have to vacate the premises), and damages if not substancial enough to reach to actual or constructive eviction. Peter would have to see if he is able to claim actual eviction. In the case of the brick wall encroaching onto the property, it was determined that eviction from part of the premises is eviction from the whole and the tenant can stop paying rent. The rationale is that the tenant pays on the whole of the premises and it's not fair to make him pay the same amount if he has lesser land than the lease specified. The lack of full access to the doors does not constitute actual eviction becasue they are still accessible and dont take away the amount of land/premises Peter is entitled to. Here, the only possible actual eviction is in reltion to the designated parking spot. If the construction equipment on a portion of the parking space Peter would have to see if he is able to claim actual eviction. In the case of the brick wall encroaching onto the property, it was determined that eviction from part of the premises is eviction from the whole and the tenant can stop paying rent.

Here, the only possible actual eviction is in reltion to the designated parking spot. If the construction equipment on a portion of the parking space dispossesed the tenant from part of the land he agreed to in the lease, he can claim actual eviction. If that is considered part of the premises he is entitled to, he can vacate the property and not have to pay rent. For actual eviction, Linda, the landlord, will likley argue that she lowerded his rent by $100, providing him damages for the partial eviction. In the brick wall case, one of the possibilities was that rent could be lowered to provide compensation for the partial eviction. Linda could also possibly argue that she could provide Peter with a new spot or that the parking spot does not really relate to the premises completely. The next possible remedy for a landlord's breach in the CQE is constructive eviction. In the case of Reste Realty, there was constant flooding that greatly impacted the daily routine of the tenants, and although they frequently notified the landlord of the issue, the issue was not remedied and the tenants vacated the premised. In that case, it was extablished that for a tenant to get constructive eviction, the landlord has to substantially interfere with the tenant's premises, the tenant has to notify the landlord and allow a reasonable time for repairs, and the tenant can vacate premises in a reasonable time if damages are not fixed within a reasonable time. Here, there is substancial interference; there is great impact to the back door having access, the windows have to be closed becasue of the dust, his parking space is being encroached on, there are fewer customers at the pizza shop, and his staff is having trouble making deliveries. This construction is greatly impacting his business and substancially interfering with the premised. Peter also notified Linda of the problems and she did deduct some rent, but the week long construction turned into months and he repeatedly notified her and she isn't doing anything to mitigate the problems. Peter would need to vacate the premises under constructive eviction for him to be allowed to stop paying rent. However, he has still not vacated, and Linda would likely argue that it was not within a reasonable time. However, in the Reste Realty case, the tenants took a while to vacate the premises because they kept waiting for the landlord to fix the problems, and after a major flood they finally evacuated and that was seen as a reasonable time. In this situation, Peter did keep notifying her weekly, so there is a possibility that it could still be seen as a reasonable time to vacate the premises. Also, Linda would likley argue that she did not breach the CQE because she is not responsible for how long it is taking, that is the construction companies fault. She might argue that Peter should bring suit allowed to stop paying rent. However, he has still not vacated, and Linda would likely argue that it was not within a reasonable time.

Also, Linda would likley argue that she did not breach the CQE because she is not responsible for how long it is taking, that is the construction companies fault. She might argue that Peter should bring suit against them instead of her. She could also argue that it is not permanent damage like in Reste Realty with the constant flooding, but that it is only temporary and the construction will have an endpoint, making its interference not substancial Further, if the interference is not substancial enough to be actual or construcitive eviction, Peter can ask for damages. In the case of Echo Consulting, there was construction, but it was temporary so it did not result to constructive eviction. The facts were similar to this case where there was noise and blocked access to one door and the court concluded that Echo was entitled to damages because there was a breach in the CQE. Here, if Peter cannot fully claim constructive eviction, he could be entitled to damages due to the difficulty of the back door access, the noise, and the impact the construction has had on his business. Linda will likely argue that she has already paid Peter a damage fee by lowering his rent, but it is likely that that amount will not be seen as enough. Further, if Peter does decide to exit the lease, he can argue that the landlord has a duty to reasonably look for a new tenant. In the case of Sommer v. Kirdel, the tenant's marriage fell through and he was not able to go through with the lease. He notified the landlord and there were even other tenants that wanted to rent the apartment. The court determined that the landlord has the duty to mitigate damages and reasonably look for a new tenant if a tenant exits a lease. Here, Peter can argue that Linda has to reasonably search for a new tenant if he decides to exit the lease. The burden of proof will be on Linda to show that she reasonably looked for a new tenant. However, Linda will likely argue that it is not fair to place this undue buren on her to find a new tenant becasue she could lose out on renting another place and may have to continuely search for new tenants if they are allowed to exit a lease early. In this situation, I would advice Peter to argue that there was a breach in the CQE and to argue that he should not have to continue paying rent due to actual or constructive eviction, and if those dont work, he could be entitled to damages. He could also leave and place the burden on Linda to reasonably search for a new tenant. It would also be beneficial to him to place money in escrow.

6726ea7e-8d3e-46f5-bb70-5aff7c5b6402," The first issue of discussion is what interests were created by Dana's conveyance. A fee simple subject to condition subsequent is one in which a person conveys land on the condition of an event happening. If the event is violated, the conveyance will be terminated. Here, Dana's conveyance created a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because she conveys her property to Eve so long as Eve does not sell or attempt to sell the property. This conveyance presumably states that Dana conveys Blackacre to Eve and there will be no violation as long as Eve retains ownership of Blackacre. Dana dies testate, meaning she died with a will in which she conveys all of her personal property to her daughter, Fiona. Eve's interest in Blackacre is a FSSCS and following this conveyance, Dana's interest is now a right of entry or power of termination, which means that if Eve violates the conveyance and attempts to sell the property, Dana may re-enter and take possession of Blackacre and terminate her original conveyance to Eve. Fiona may not have any interest in Blackacre since Dana's conveyance does not include Fiona. Dana's will transfers all her personal property to Fiona, but Blackacre is considered real property and not transferable to Fiona via the will. However, any of Dana's personal property in or on Blackacre may be determined to belong to Fiona by the language of Dana's will because Fiona inherits all of Dana's personal property. If Eve attempts to sell Blackacre, she is faced with at least two problems or weaknesses to her stance. First, Dana's conveyance does not only state that Eve may not sell the house, but Eve may not ATTEMPT to sell the house. Any consideration taken by a real estate developer may be considered by a court as an attempt to sell the property, since Eve will be receiving quotes as to the value of the property or offers from potential buyers. Second, Eve may enter another problem with Fiona regarding any possible personal property within the home. Dana's property likely is not vacant; it likely is furnished with many items that will be classified as personal property. If this is the case and Eve happens to sell the property, this will likely lead Eve and the buyer to presume that any personal property within the home remains in the home upon purchase. Eve may possibly present the argument that, since she is not maintaining the property well, it would be will keep it in good shape. She may also assert in the best interest to sell the property to someone2who that Dana would want the property to be well taken care of and that Eve has been unable to fulfill Dana's expectations. Of course, this argument may not be the strongest, but a court of law, for policy furnished with many items that will be classified as personal property. If this is the case and Eve happens to sell the property, this will likely lead Eve and the buyer to presume that any personal property within the home remains in the home upon purchase. Eve may possibly present the argument that, since she is not maintaining the property well, it would be in the best interest to sell the property to someone who will keep it in good shape. She may also assert that Dana would want the property to be well taken care of and that Eve has been unable to fulfill Dana's expectations. Of course, this argument may not be the strongest, but a court of law, for policy rationales, may interpret the conveyance's language and possibly determine that it would be in the best interest for the property to be well-maintained and used in an ordinary, residential fashion. Eve may also argue that, since Fiona lives in NYC and does not have an interest in returning to New Suffolk, Fiona has weakened her claim that she has any basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre. Fiona likely will have a stronger claim to reside in Blackacre than Eve's attempt to sell. As Dana's daughter who inherits Dana's personal property, Fiona has a great interest in Blackacre because it can likely serve as the venue for Dana's personal property, which Fiona inherits. Her only weakness is the true language of the will. Dana conveys Blackacre to Eve with only one condition. The conveyance does not reference Fiona, nor does it state any inheritance to Fiona. Fiona may argue that, since she already inherits Dana's personal property, Fiona is somewhat on Dana's mind to hold some basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre. On the other hand, Eve may argue that, since Dana had Fiona in mind to transfer all of her personal property to but did not mention Fiona in her conveyance of Blackacre, Dana intentionally omitted Fiona from any interest in Blackacre. Also, Fiona's strongest argument is Eve's negligence in not properly caring for Blackacre; allowing roof shingles to go missing, cracked glass, and other problems without repair. Under New Suffolk law, every grant or devise of real estate shall pass all the estate or interest of the grantor or devisor unless the intent to pass a less estate appears by express terms, or be necessarily implied in the terms of the instrument. Fiona can assert that Dana's intentions of a well-maintained home is implied in her conveyance, although not expressly stated. Eve's argument may go to the auto-pay of the property tax. Eve may state that she did not completely vacate the home and kept it in her possession by continuing tax payments to avoid defaulting or losing legal possession of the property. Fiona may also assert the fact that, because she lived and grew up on Blackacre all throughout her childhood and teenage years, she should have an interest and an ability to reclaim ownership when Eve's negligent actions are causing harm to the property. Finally, how should property be distributed under this jurisdiction? New Suffolk states that, if property of a deceased is not distributed according to a will, the property should be first distributed to issue, Eve may state that she did not completely vacate the home and kept it in her possession by continuing tax payments to avoid defaulting or losing legal possession of the property. Fiona may also assert the fact that, because she lived and grew up on Blackacre all throughout her childhood and teenage years, she should have an interest and an ability to reclaim ownership when Eve's negligent actions are causing harm to the property. Finally, how should property be distributed under this jurisdiction? New Suffolk states that, if property of a deceased is not distributed according to a will, the property should be first distributed to issue, then ancestors, then collaterals. In this case, If a court determines that Dana's will is ambiguous, the court may exercise its discretion and distribute Blackacre to Fiona as issue before considering distribution to Eve as collateral. Like in White v. Brown where the will was rather ambiguous to some judges presiding over the legal issue of what conveynace was intended by the draftor of the will, Dana's will expressly states the condition that Eve does not attempt to sell the property, and also states that the house is not to be sold. A court may interpret White v. Brown and consider Dana's conveyance as ambiguous, or possibly find it clear upon its face as the dissent did in White. Under New Suffolk law, action to recover title to or possession of property shall be brought within ten years after the cause of action. If a person is under the age of minority, such person may bring an action within five years after the disability is removed. Here, Fiona is leaving for college, presumably at the age of 18, but not certain. Sixteen years later, Fiona seeks to remove Eve from possessing Blackacre. At this age, Fiona has surpassed the disability window of five years after the disability is removed, since she has exceeded the time of five years in the sixteen years that have passed. "," What are Peter's rights as a tenant when he is faced with repairs at his pizza shop? Under a Landlord/Tenant lease, the landlord has a duty and an obligation to maintain a covenant of habitabiltiy, which is implied in a lease. A landlord also has a duty to provide to the tenant a warranty of habitability. As in the Echo case, there are three factors that determine when a tenant is unable to continue his tenancy: partial/actual eviction, constructive eviction, and breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment. All three will be discussed independently. First, Peter may assert that he is actually evicted from the premises, that is, he cannot use the premises as he normally would. Unlike in the Echo case where the court determined that the bank employees were still able to enter the bank through one of the doors that remained open, Peter can argue that, despite the rear door's availability, it is rather inconvenient and difficult for his customers to enter, and it is making it rather difficult for him to execute pizza deliveries. This is affecting his work and his income and revenue three will be discussed independently. First, Peter may assert that he is actually evicted from the premises, that is, he cannot use the premises as he normally would. Unlike in the Echo case where the court determined that the bank employees were still able to enter the bank through one of the doors that remained open, Peter can argue that, despite the rear door's availability, it is rather inconvenient and difficult for his customers to enter, and it is making it rather difficult for him to execute pizza deliveries. This is affecting his work and his income and revenue will be significantly reduced. If this happens, he will face setbacks in making his monthly rent payments. This clearly will not be tolerated by Linda as the landlord and a court will likely expect this possibility to be mitigated as soon as possible because, a default or delay in rent payments may commence another issue between Peter and Linda, such as penalties or violations. In New Suffolk, a court likely wants to avoid any and all legal issues to reduce the amount of cases in its court and to promote out-of-court resolutions to potential legal issues. Second, Peter may have a good claim asserting constructive eviction. Like the Echo case where the bank was unable to go about its business with customers seeking financial services due to construction, or like in the case with the flooded home via the driveway where the tenant was unable to reside in a room filled with water, Peter is unable to use the property becuase the dust enters the pizza shop each time he opens a window or a door. Also, this is a health safety hazard. One of Peter's strongest arguments (and I recommend his counsel begin with this one) is the safety and health concern. His products and ingredients, along with his kitchen equipment will be contaminated with bacteria from the construction and thus, he will be unable or should be unable to operate his restaurant. Third, Peter has a right to quiet enjoyment of the premises. Like the case which involved a home with no heat, a broken sewage, broken windows, no door locks, etc. where the tenant was unable to exercise a reasonable stay in the home, Peter cannot be expected to continue his pizza shop operation because it is not suitable both for him and his customers with contsruction and noise that is now lasting months. Like in the previously cited case where the tenant evicted the residence and ceased paying rent, Peter may be able to cease paying Linda his rent until the construction is complete and there no longer exists any dust or inconvenience thereafter. Linda's best arguement to address Peter's suspended payments is her offer to deduct $100 from his monthly rent, although Peter or a court may not find a 5% reduction sufficient, given Peter's decline in income and revenue as he is missing out on his usual practice of business and serving customers. Another right Peter may address is his parking spot being encroached upon. Although this may not be one of Peter's best arguments, he may assert that the construction equipment pose possible damage to his vehicle while they are being used by the contractors. Peter may assert his right to his parking spot without the concern of property damage. any dust or inconvenience thereafter. Linda's best arguement to address Peter's suspended payments is her offer to deduct $100 from his monthly rent, although Peter or a court may not find a 5% reduction sufficient, given Peter's decline in income and revenue as he is missing out on his usual practice of business and serving customers.

Although this may not be one of Peter's best arguments, he may assert that the construction equipment pose possible damage to his vehicle while they are being used by the contractors. Peter may assert his right to his parking spot without the concern of property damage. As the tenant, Peter must give Linda a reasonable time to fix the property. Like the previously cited case with broken windows and a broken sewage pipe, Linda has a duty to mitigate damages, and if Peter in fact moves out of the premises, Linda will have the obligation to find another tenant. Here, Peter was apparantly patient with repairs that were estimated by the contractor to take one week or so that he even left for vacation. However, since the repairs are now taking months, Peter seems to have a valid claim to assert that he gave Linda a reasonable time to fix the damages. It is likely that a court will allow Peter to leave the premises and terminate his lease early. ",1346,981
a1c0fd24-2631-4df5-addc-e01a239607d6," 1. The issue at hand is determining what kinds of interests were created by Dana's conveyance. The language in the conveyance can be somehwat ambiguous therefore, it could be interpreted in many ways. The interest created could be a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because of the conditional language, ""provided that."" The conveyance could also be a fee simple determinable based on the durational language, ""so long as."" The conveyance could have also created a life estate because the language, ""not to be sold,"" could mean that Eve is meant to have the house for life. Lastly, it could be a fee simple absolute because it could be interpreted as conveying the house to Eve indefinitely. In White v. Brown, the conveyance at issue included the same language, ""not to be sold."" The court was deciding whether it was a life estate or a fee simple absolute. The majority said it was a fee simple absolute because it should be read in the way the statute interpreted to be. Also, favoring a fee simple absolute. The dissenting argued that it was a clearly a life estate based on the intent of the language. Following the court's ruling in White v. Brown, the conceyance at hand would most likely be viewed as a fee simple absolute. The next issue is whether Eve has any arguents she could make that she should be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of blackacre. If the conveyance was found to have been a fee simple absolute for Eve, she could argue that she has the right to do whatever she wants to do with blackacre because fee simple absolute is the champion of all estates. Eve could also argue economic waste. The property is worth way more than Eve thought it would be because of its location and selling it would only increase the value because it could possibly be sold to someone who can take care of the property better. In the Arkland case, it was decided that economic waste was not the only test, but the dissenting believed that economic waste should be highly considered. By not selling the property, Eve could be jepoardizing the economic value of the property. In the Baker case, it was decided that waste was not the only test and the parties best interest should be considered. Eve could argue that selling the home would be in the best interest. Lastly, in Woodrick, the traditional law was discussed which believes that waste can not be if it increases the value of property. Eve could argue she was not creating waste because selling the house would only increase the value. The next issue is whether Fiona has any arguments to reclaim the property or hold Eve accountable for the repairs needed on the property. Fiona could argue that since the will states she will receive all of jepoardizing the economic value of the property. In the Baker case, it was decided that waste was not the only test and the parties best interest should be considered. Eve could argue that selling the home would be in the best interest. Lastly, in Woodrick, the traditional law was discussed which believes that waste can not be if it increases the value of property. Eve could argue she was not creating waste because selling the house would only increase the value. The next issue is whether Fiona has any arguments to reclaim the property or hold Eve accountable for the repairs needed on the property. Fiona could argue that since the will states she will receive all of Dana's personal property that blackacre belongs to her, but this could be weak because the will states personal and not real property. Fiona could also argue that if the conveyane was an FSD or FSSCS, Eve broke the conditions of both and the property should go to Fiona. Fiona also could argue that Eve is causing permissive waste. Permissive waste is the failure to maintain or take care of the property. When Fiona saw the property, the roof shingles were missing, the glass was cracked, and there were other serious problems. This shows that Eve has not been taking care of the property. Fiona could also make arguments against Eve's arguments. In the Arkland case, the court decided that even though economic value should be considered, it is not the utimate test and they decided that sentimental value should be considered. When Fiona saw the property, she immediately felt sentimental and the property meant something to her. Similar to the Baker case, where they decided the parties best interests should be considered, Fiona could argue that it is in her best interest to take over the property because at the moment it is not being taken care of and this way, it is out of Eve's hands for her best interest as well. Eve could argue against this because Fiona is never at the property, does not live there anymore and has not seen it for years. Lastly Fiona could argue waste based on the common law discussed in the Woodrick case. Fiona's arguments will most likely prevail over Eve's based on the sentimental value and the aspects of waste. "," The issue at hand is discussing Peter's rights and his options and any claims he can make. Peter could argue that his CQE was breached. A breach of CQE could result in: 1) actual/partial eviction, 2) constructive eviction, 3) damages. Peter's lease provides him with ""approximately 2000 sq feet of floor area, together with a common right of access thereto, a common use of the parking lot, and one designated parking spot."" Peter could argue that his rights in this lease were violated. right of access was violated. The scaffoling It could be argued that Peter's right to the common largely blockes access to the rear door which is used by customers when they park in the common lot in the rear, and used by employees, especially while they are making deliveries, they park their cars in could argue that his CQE was breached. A breach of CQE could result in: 1) actual/partial eviction, 2) constructive eviction, 3) damages. Peter's lease provides him with ""approximately 2000 sq feet of floor area, together with a common right of access thereto, a common use of the parking lot, and one designated parking spot."" Peter could argue that his rights in this lease were violated. It could be argued that Peter's right to the common right of access was violated. The scaffoling largely blockes access to the rear door which is used by customers when they park in the common lot in the rear, and used by employees, especially while they are making deliveries, they park their cars in the rear common lot and can pull a car right up to the back door. Because of the scaffolding, customers have to navigate through the ""maze"" of the scaffolding, as well as employees making deliveries, and it is quite hard to carry the pizza through the ""maze"" of the scaffolding. Due to this, Peter is having a hard time making on-time pizza deliveries. Peter could also argue that his right to the 2,000 sq ft of the area was violated because he was not allowed to fully enjoy the area. It was noisy from the construction and Peter had to keep his windows closed due to the dust from the construction. He immediately notices that because of this, there are less customers. In the Reste realty case, there was flooding which led to the tenant having to leave. It was decided that whatever interrupts or disturbs one's enjoyment of the property they are entitled to it a breach of CQE, and this applies to Peter's case as well. Further, it could be argued that Peter's right to his parking spot was violated. The construction equipment encroaches on a little over the white line of his parking lot, he can still fit but he has to squeeze. Peter is entitled to the entire parking spot. And according to the smiths rule, even a partial eviction is an eviction. In the brick wall case, a brick wall slightly enroached onto one's property, and it was decided that it was a partial eviction. To have Peter leave without being responsible for payin the rest of his 5 year lease, he could argue for constructive eviction. The elements of constructive eviction are: 1) there has to be an interference by the landlord, 2) the interference must be substantial, 3) the landlord must give notice to the landlord and give the landlord a reasonable amount of time to address the issue, and 4) the tenant must actually leave the premises. The first element could be met because the landlord is the one who planned the construction, therefore it could be said that it was her interference. The second element could be met because due to the construction causing the entrances to be largely blocked, Peter's shop has less customers and his staff are having trouble making pizza deliveries on time and due to this, his revenues from the pizza shop are down. Those could be argued to be substantial interferences. The third element could be met because Linda stated the construction would only take a week or so, after the week was up, Peter called her about his concerns and she stated it is taking a little longer than expected, but the construction lasted for months. This could be meeting the element because Peter told her about his construction, therefore it could be said that it was her interference. The second element could be met because due to the construction causing the entrances to be largely blocked, Peter's shop has less customers and his staff are having trouble making pizza deliveries on time and due to this, his revenues from the pizza shop are down. Those could be argued to be substantial interferences. The third element could be met because Linda stated the construction would only take a week or so, after the week was up, Peter called her about his concerns and she stated it is taking a little longer than expected, but the construction lasted for months. This could be meeting the element because Peter told her about his concerns. Peter could also be advised to notify Linda that he is leaving, and give her a reasonable amount of time, even though a lot of time has passed, and if nothing changes, then he may leave. Which brings us to the fourth element, Peter could be advised to actually leave the premises and he would meet all of the elements of constructive eviction. Linda could also make arguments that weaken Peter's claims. For constructive eviction, the interference must actually be the landlord's fault. Linda could argue that it is not her fault directly and she has been doing everything she can to get the construction to be done with. Linda could also argue that Peter's lease did not include the right to the back door. This would greatly weaken Peter's argument. In the case where the occupant's door was not accessible, it was decided that it was not an eviction, partial or constructive, because the lease did not directly state the right to the door. Peter had the right to the common right of access, this could be taken as to mean the front door, not the back door. But Peter could argue back and say that the back door was a common right of access since that is where the common parking lot is and where many of the customers enter. Peter may also be entitled to damages. He could argue for damages for him closing down his restaurant for a week for the construction, without avail. He could also argue for the money he has lost due to the construction. Peter's arugments may outweigh Linda's and he may not be responsible for paying the rest of his 5 year lease. ",869,1125
f509ba10-a9ed-4759-a0a4-bb0393e64ddb," Conveyance The issue here is to determine what kinds of interest were created by Dana's conveyance. The conveyance says that it is to be conveyed to Eve, provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house. The rules of constructions are used whenever there is ambiguity in the language of a conveyance asnd it states that we should favor a Fee simple subject to condition subsequent over a Fee simple determinable. Hence, although it the term of art ""provided that"" used for FSSCS and ""only so long as"" is FSD, Eve's present interest in Blackacre is in Fee simple subject to condition subsequent and Dana has the Right of entry or termination in fee simple absolute if the condition is violated. The ambiguity in this case can be likened to that of the Mahrenholz case where the family conveyed the land to a school district to be used ""for school purposes only"". The court said the word ""only"" should be seen as ""only so long as"" which would cause it to be durational and would mean that it would fall under the fee simple determinable. Additionally, the court pointed out the fact that the conveyance stated that the land would revert back to the grantor if the land was no longer used for school purposes. For the fact that there was a reversion within the conveyance, the court was able to say that the interest was a fee simple determinable. In this case, there is no reversion stated. It is not stated that the land will go back to Dana and so it is safe to eliminate FSD from the conveyance. Under FSSCS, there is no reversion, but a right of entry/termination by the grantor. The ambiguity in this case is also similar to that of the White case, where the aunt conveyed the house to her niece and said that the house should not be sold. The courts debated on whether the language should be interpreted as a Fee simple absolute or as a life estate. They said unless stated otherwise, it should be a FSA. However, the dissent argued that for the fact that there was a limitation on what should be done with the house, in terms of it not being sold, the conveyance was not in FSA. In this case, there is a limitation on what Eve can do with the property, hence it is not FSA. If Dana was alive at the time the condition was violated, she would have the right to terminate Eve's interest. However, since she is dead and devised all her personal property to her daughter Fiona, Fiona now carries the interest of Right of entry/termination if the conveyance is violated. This is the basis that Fiona could use to reclaim interest in Blackacre since Eve attempted to sell the house should be a FSA. However, the dissent argued that for the fact that there was a limitation on what should be done with the house, in terms of it not being sold, the conveyance was not in FSA. In this case, there is a limitation on what Eve can do with the property, hence it is not FSA. If Dana was alive at the time the condition was violated, she would have the right to terminate Eve's interest. However, since she is dead and devised all her personal property to her daughter Fiona, Fiona now carries the interest of Right of entry/termination if the conveyance is violated. This is the basis that Fiona could use to reclaim interest in Blackacre since Eve attempted to sell the house Eve's Argument for selling the house In selling the house, Eve could argue that she is looking at the interest of both parties from the Anna case where the court said it is important to look at the interest of both parties when a court is going to order a judicial sale of land. She could argue that the house is old and falling apart and the deteriotation of it would be an economic waste because the house is not being used in a produtive capacity. The woodrick case argued that breaking down a property is not considered waste if there is an increase in value; Eve could argue that selling the house would not be considered waste because they would be profiting from the land. Fiona might argue that a parition in kind might be better for the interest of both parties so that they could each decide what they want to do with their share of the land. From the Arkland case, a partition in sale can be done over a partition in kind when it favors the interest of one or more parties, when a partition in kind would be an inconvenience, and when a partition in sale does not prejudice the other party. Eve could argue that the sale of the house would favor both she and Fiona because they would not have to deal with fixtures of the house or pay property taxes and that a partiion in kind would be more of an inconvenience because they would have to deal with the taxes and fixtures in order to maintain the house. Additionally, the amount that is being offered is way more than the house is worth and so they could divide the shares for fairness and certainty of equitable relief. Eve could argue that it is not prejudiced because she is not only looking to her own interest, but also the interest of Fiona and the negative cost of keeping the house. From the dissent's argument in Arkland, Eve could argue that Fiona does not even live in the house and so it would not affect her if the house was sold. Furthemore, she could say Fiona uses the house sporadically and the only time she came there was five years after her mother died. Also, Eve could argue that she was the one paying the property taxes and so she had invested her own finances into the property, like Anna had invested her time into the farm in the weedon case, and so she deserved to be compensated for it. Though this is a bit of a weak 3argument, Eve could claim the land through adverse possession, (if she meets the continous, hostile, actuale, notorious and open, exclusive elements), if so it would not affect her if the house was sold. Furthemore, she could say Fiona uses the house sporadically and the only time she came there was five years after her mother died. Also, Eve could argue that she was the one paying the property taxes and so she had invested her own finances into the property, like Anna had invested her time into the farm in the weedon case, and so she deserved to be compensated for it. Though this is a bit of a weak argument, Eve could claim the land through adverse possession, (if she meets the continous, hostile, actuale, notorious and open, exclusive elements), if Fiona never claims her right of entry on the land and then Eve would own the land in FSA. Since Fiona does not have a reversionary interest, she would have to actually go and take Blackacre from Eve and if she does not within the statute of limitations, Eve could claim ownership of Blackacre and decide to sell the land. Fiona's argument Fiona could argue that Eve no longer has an interest in Blackacre because she violated the condition, which means that Fiona has the right to terminate and right of entry to take back Blackacre from Eve. Fiona could argue that by Eve locking the door to home on Blackacre she abandoned it when she moved to Florida, this is not like the Berg v. Wiley case where the restaurant owner temporarily left the restaurant because the Restaurant owner did not actually leave, but in this case Eve actually abandoned the property. Under the bundle and duties of rights, Fiona could argue that Eve had a duty to use the property with resonable care which she did not because when Fiona saw the house, it had missing roof shingles, broken glass, and many other issues. It can be argued that this was permissive waste because Eve was negligent when she abandoned the property and she did not take care of the property as she should have. In the Arkland case, the court said it would be harsh to sell the home of the Caudills because they wanted to keep it in the family and there was an emotional attachment to it; Fiona could make a similar argument by saying it was her mother's home and the mother wanted to keep it in the family that's why she conveyed it to Eve, another family member, and that's why she said the house should not be sold. Additionally, no amount of money can replace the emotional connection that Fiona has with the home like in the Caudills in the Arkland case. The rules of constructions states that in interpreting an ambiguous conveyance, the goal should be to achieve the grantor's intent. By looking at Dana's intent not to sell the home, and her giving the house to her cousin, it is evident that she wanted to keep it in the family. Unlike in the white case, the restraint of alientation in this case would not be void because Eve did not own the home in FSA and since she violated the condition, Fiona now has a right of entry in FSA and gets to decide what to do with the property.

Unlike in the white case, the restraint of alientation in this case would not be void because Eve did not own the home in FSA and since she violated the condition, Fiona now has a right of entry in FSA and gets to decide what to do with the property. Since Eve is no longer suppossed to be on Blackacre based on violation of the condition, Fiona has the right to exclude her from Blackacre like in the Jacque v Steenberg case. She could argue that Eve is trespassing and is trying to sell her home without a right to do so. Fiona has the right to exclude trespassers from her property as long as she is not infringing on the rights of others. Fiona could hold Eve accountable for repairs by suing for damages if Eve is unwilling to pay. She could argue that there was an actual harm, like in the Jacque v. Steenberg homes case where they obtained damages when the intentional trespass caused harm. In this case, the house was damaged and not left in the same condition that it was given and so this could be considered a harm, under the bundle of rights which says, there is a duty to not harm. "," The issue in this case is whether Peter could break his lease without having to pay for the remaining five years. Peter currently has a tenancy for term of years because there is a fixed end date for when the lease can end. In advising Peter, the strongest argument he could make is that there has been a breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment. In all leases, both residential and commercial, there is an implied promise by the landlord that the tenant will be able to occupy the actual possession of the premise peacebly without any disturbances in their use or enjoyment of the premises. Any act or omission by the landlord that affects the use of the tenant's property will provide a remedy for constructive eviction. Constructive eviction is different from actual eviction because it is not physical, but it is when the acts or omissions of the landlord are so substantial that they deprive the right of the tenant to quietly enjoy the use of the property In this case, it is evident that there has been a breach of CQE. Peter's purpose for renting the space was to conduct his business of selling Pizzas. Any interruption of that by the landlord can be seen as a breach. This is similar to the Reste Realty case where the lady rented the office space in the basement of the building and her office constantly flooded when it rained. The flooding of the rain affected her of the landlord are so substantial that they deprive the right of the tenant to quietly enjoy the use of the property In this case, it is evident that there has been a breach of CQE. Peter's purpose for renting the space was to conduct his business of selling Pizzas. Any interruption of that by the landlord can be seen as a breach. This is similar to the Reste Realty case where the lady rented the office space in the basement of the building and her office constantly flooded when it rained. The flooding of the rain affected her business because all her files got wet and additionally when she had a business meeting with important people for the company, the flood happened in the office and this was described at the crowning blow of it all. Peter's case is similar because though the renovation is temporary, it is affecting his business and the landlord told him that the renovation would only take a week, however, the renovations have taken longer than a week. It did not rain all the time in the Reste Realty case, but whenever it did it affected her business. In the same way, the renovations are not permanent but they are affecting Peter's quiet use and enjoyment of the property. The dust entering the pizza shop from the window could affect the pizzas that Peter is making and violate health codes which could cause Peter's shop to get shut down. The noise entering the shop could disturb the customers and substantially affects the peace and enjoyment promised to Peter. Linda might argue that the repairs are happening in common areas, like in the Echo case, and not the area that Peter is paying rent for. She might also argue that Peter is granted common access but not exclusive access, like the court defined in the Echo case. However, though these repairs are happening on the outside of the property Peter is leasing, they are encroaching on his use of the property on the inside because it is affecting his business like how the rain happening on the outside in the Reste Realty case was affecting the woman's business on the inside. Hence, he could claim constructive eviction. Peter could also make the argument that the car being partially parked on his designated parking spark constituted partial eviction because since the lot spot is included in his lease, it means he is paying for it and it means he is entitled to the whole thing. Hence, just like in the smith v. mcenany case where the brick wall encroached on the tenant's use of the land partially and the court said this constituted eviction, Peter could argue for a remedy of partial eviction since he was entitle to the whole lot spot, but the construction equipment encroached on it. Linda may argue that Peter cannot claim constructive eviction because after Peter notified her, she reduced his rent by $100 within a reasonable time. However, though she compensated him, the renovations still did not end within a reasonable time because Peter was still suffering as a result of the continuous repairs that were taking so long because what was said to take one week took months. This is like when the lady in the Reste case notified one of brick wall encroached on the tenant's use of the land partially and the court said this constituted eviction, Peter could argue for a remedy of partial eviction since he was entitle to the whole lot spot, but the construction equipment encroached on it. Linda may argue that Peter cannot claim constructive eviction because after Peter notified her, she reduced his rent by $100 within a reasonable time. However, though she compensated him, the renovations still did not end within a reasonable time because Peter was still suffering as a result of the continuous repairs that were taking so long because what was said to take one week took months. This is like when the lady in the Reste case notified one of the landlord's assistance in the building who temporarily resolved the flooding and then when he died the flooding continued in the case. In this case, the deduction in rent provided a temporary solution, but not a permanent one because Peter's business was still being affected by the renovations. If Peter wants to break his lease early, he does not have to worry about the landlord using self-help methods against him like the court spoke against in the Berg v. Wiley case. Landlords are not allowed to use self-help methods because the court said that they do not have the right to take matters into their own hands and they must resort to judicial processes if they have any issues with the tenant. In doing this, the court want to protect the rights of landlords and owners and the integrity of the legal system and prevent dueling like mentioned in the Jacque v. Steenberg case. Additionally, Peter will not have to worry about being responsible for paying the rent for the time he is gone because based on the Sommer v. Kridel case, landlord has to attempt to relet their premises in order to mitigate damages. In doing this, they must reach out to agencies, post ads, etc in order to show that they reasonably attempted to relet the apartment. Also, Peter has given notice to his landlord and after giving notice the tenant can leave the premise within a reasonable time of notifying the landlord. Since this is a commercial lease and not a residential lease, implied warranty of habitability cannot be applied here and it would be a weak argument. Peter, may however, withhold rent from the landlord like the tenant in the Hilder case did, until the landlord is done with the renovations of the building. Though not mandatory, Peter should keep the withheld rent in escrow just to make a claim before the court to prove he did not withhold the rent due to lack of money but because of the breach of CQE. Linda might argue from the minority view that landlords are not responsible for damages or anything that happens with the tenant's premise. However, Caveat lessees do not apply because under modern law, it is the landlord's responsibility to take care of any fixtures within the premises and not the tenant. The landlord is in a better position to do so, hence Peter does not have to take care of any damages to the property unless he is responsible. To conclude, Peter's strongest argument would be to claim contructive eviction.

6f684adb-beb1-4e9c-8d7d-76e0637baf2b," In the original conveyance while Dana was still alive, Dana conveyed Blackare to Eve, with Eve receiving a fee simple determinable estate (FSD) and Dana obtaining a possibility of reverter (POR) in fee simple absolute (FSA). The conveyance was for a fee simple determinable since it used durational language, such as ""so long as."" However, Dana passed away testate and conveyed all of her personal property to her daughter Fiona. Assuming personal property does not include real property such as the estate, Fiona would still becme the owner of the property as Dana's sole living issue. Thus, under NS law, future interests (Dana's future interest in Blackacre was a POR in FSA) would then be inherited by Fiona intestate. Fiona could then argue she holds future interest in blackacre as a POR in FSA. However, the original conveyance of blackacre uses ambiguous language. Similar to the case where a collateral relative was given the estate ""for life"" but with a condition, the court will look at Dana's original conveyance using the rules of contruction. Under the general rules of contruction for ambiguous language in conveyances, and according to the provisions set forth in New Suffolk, partial intestacies are not preferred (in this case, Fiona would receive all interests, not partial interests, in the estate), a FSA is always the most preferred outcome for estates, and when looking to ambiguous language, the court must look to the intent of the grantor. Thus, by using the language ""so long as"", Dana is indicating that she intended for Eve to live on the property indefinitely, unless she were to attempt to sell the property. If the condition occurs, i.e. Eve attempting to sell the property, then the property would automatically revert back to the grantor. Since Dana died testate, Fiona could argue she was given Dana's future interest in the property by intestacy. Since Fiona's future interest would be a POR, she does not need to take affirmative steps to reclaim the property - it will automatically revert back to her in FSA once the condition occurs. However, Eve could argue she hasn't attempted to sell the property just yet, since she was approached unwillingly by a developer and did not consent to any sale terms; thus, the property is still held by Eve. Eve can futher argue that since Dana died intestate, and the court looks to the original intent of Dana and the express language conveying the property ""so long as,"" then Eve still retains her present interest in Blackacre in fee simple determinable. Eve could potentially argue that the property should be sold under the theory of waste. Since the property is not being used for its purpose, economic waste is being committed, similar to an argument in the Arkland case about the mining potential and value of the property. If the estate is worth a the property is still held by Eve. Eve can futher argue that since Dana died intestate, and the court looks to the original intent of Dana and the express language conveying the property ""so long as,"" then Eve still retains her present interest in Blackacre in fee simple determinable. Eve could potentially argue that the property should be sold under the theory of waste. Since the property is not being used for its purpose, economic waste is being committed, similar to an argument in the Arkland case about the mining potential and value of the property. If the estate is worth a staggering amount of money, and is not being used as such or being improved to reflect as such, then it is wasteful to not sell. Eve can argue to the courts that the most equitable outcome for both Fiona nd Eve is to sell the property and split the amount. However, Fiona could argue that economic value and avoiding injustice to others is not the sole test for the determining whether a land should be partition for sale, that the courts should also look to the nostalgic and longtime connection the property a family member would have. In this case, Fiona would argue she is sentimental about Blackare and wishes to return. If so, Fiona could argue that Eve, as the present interest holder if the condition to attempt to sell does not occur, is liable for the damages to the property and should pay for the repairs under the theory that Eve committed permissive waste by neglecting to keep the estate in habitable condition for future interest holders. If Eve were to argue that the refusal to sell the property is committing waste, and did attempt to sell the property, the condition to never attempt to sell the property would occur. Courts, when looking at ambiguous languages in conveyances, always prefer a FSA above all, but will also look to the intent of the grantor when conveying the property. In this case, Dana intended for the property to never be sold, and if the conveyee did attempt to sell the property, then it would revert back to the original grantor. In this situation, the original grantor is now Fiona by the terms of the will, or at the very least by the guidelines in NS law. The courts will then hold Fiona, as Dana's sole issue heir, holds a future interest in Blackacre with a POR in FSA, but would now be conveyed the land upon the condition happening. Eve would then have no interest in Blackacre, and Fiona would own Blackacre in FSA. As a side, Eve is not able to claim adverse possession of the property if she were to try and gain title of the land in order sell it. The statute of limitations under the NS laws is 10 years. Eve only entered Blackacre in 2010, and the current battle over the estate is occuring in 2019, falling short of the statute of limitations. However, Eve does not satisfy other elements of CHANE as well. Fiona could argue Eve does not satisfy hostile, since she was given permission by the original owner of the land. Eve could potentionally argue that Fiona was unaware of her presence on Blackacre once Fiona gained title to the land, similar to Howard v. Kunto where the mixed deeds allowed the original owners to be unaware they were encroaching on property, but even so this would not meet the statute of limitations since Fiona the land in order sell it. The statute of limitations under the NS laws is 10 years. Eve only entered Blackacre in 2010, and the current battle over the estate is occuring in 2019, falling short of the statute limitations.

Kunto where the mixed deeds allowed the original owners to be unaware they were encroaching on property, but even so this would not meet the statute of limitations since Fiona was conveyed the estate upon Dana's death in 2014. In addition, Eve leaves Blackacre, presumably upon Dana's death, and does not continuously use the land as a true owner would. "," Peter has entered in a lease of term of years with Linda for his pizza shop in Linda's commercial building, with the lease conveying common right of access, 1 desginated parking spot, and common use of the common parking lot. Taking this into account, Peter could argue that the contrustion is taking longer than a reasonable time to complete. Because of the noise and inconvenienced access for his customers and staff, Peter could argue that he is being ""constructively evicted,"" or as-if he were actually evicted. Similar to the commercial basement flooding case, Peter could argue that he is not able to conduct his business as usual, evidenced by the constant noise and dust created by the construction. In addition, the nuisances are detracting from his customers being able to come in and give them his business; these actions could be grounds for a breach of the convenant of quiet enjyment (CQE) between Peter and his landlord. By substantially interfering with Peter's ability to enjoy his premises, in this case to operate his business successfully, Peter could argue Linda is breaching the CQE. In order for Peter to successfully argue he is being constructively evicted, he must notify Linda of any repairs/remedies needed and giving Linda reasonable time to repair any defects, he must then vacate the premises if the repairs are not made within the reasonable time, thus Peter will not be held liable for any rent due on the remaining balance of the lease. In this situation, Peter has given Linda months to complete the construction and right any defects/nuisances occuring to his property. If the defects/intereferences are so substantial, Peter can argue that he has given Linda a reasonable time to repair the defects. He must then provide her notice of his intent to leave in a reasonable time if the defects are not repaired within a reasonable time after the notice is given, in order for Peter to successfully vacate the premises and break the lease. Linda, if she were to attempt to sue Peter for the remaining balance on the lease arguing there was no grounds for breach of CQE and constructive eviction, must then take reasonable steps to mitigate her damages, such as attempting to rent out the space within a reasonable time of Peter leaving the premises, prior to filing suit against Peter. Similar to defects/intereferences are so substantial, Peter can argue that he has given Linda a reasonable time to repair the defects. He must then provide her notice of his intent to leave in a reasonable time if the defects are not repaired within a reasonable time after the notice is given, in order for Peter to successfully vacate the premises and break the lease. Linda, if she were to attempt to sue Peter for the remaining balance on the lease arguing there was no grounds for breach of CQE and constructive eviction, must then take reasonable steps to mitigate her damages, such as attempting to rent out the space within a reasonable time of Peter leaving the premises, prior to filing suit against Peter. Similar to Sommer v. Kridel, where the landlord did not attempt to rent out the vacated apartments until after the original lease expired and brought suit against the original tenants, Linda must take reasonable action, such as newspaper postings, magazine postings, real estate agent showings, etc., to rent out the space prior to her suit. Additionally, Peter could argue that the minor encroachment of the construction equipment into his designated parking spot is grounds for partial eviction and can legally break the lease without being liable for the rent. Similar to the brick wall case, where a minor encroachment of a brick wall onto property was grounds for the tenant to break the lease, Peter could argue his lease gives him the use of a designated parking spot. Even though he is just able to squeeze his car in, he could argue it is not only an inconvience, but also takes away from the whole of the property given to him in his lease. According to the brick wall case, the rent paid on a property is for the whole of the property laid out in the lease, not for a little bit of it. If Peter is able to prove he is partially evicted by the minor encroachment, then he can successfully break his lease and not be liable for rent. However, Lida can argue since Peter is still able to park his car in his designated parking spot, and further arguing the construction equipment is only temporary compared to a permanent brick wall, then he is still able to use all of the property given to him in the lease. Thus, Linda can argue there is also no partial eviction due to the use of his parking spot, and in regards to his use of the backdoor. Linda can argue, citing the bank construction case where the backdoor was determined to not be specifically outlined in the original tenants lease, the backdoor itself is not specifically outlined in Peter's lease as a designated portion of his leased property. The lease only mentions ""common right of access,"" which, similar to the bank construction case, could be construed as use of the front door to the actual pizza shop, which is still functioning and not hindered by the construction. Peter's use of the backdoor is similar to all other tenants of the building, and is not specific to his shop, and is only used by Peter as a means of convenience for his pizza deliveries and customers who park in the back common parking lot. Linda could argue since the construction is still allowing Peter to use his parking spot, have common access to his shop (mostly in the front, but in the back with inconviene), use of the common parking lot, and actual use of his pizza shop, then there is no partial or actual eviction. Even if Peter could argue that the noise and construction be construed as use of the front door to the actual pizza shop, which is still functioning and not hindered by the construction. Peter's use of the backdoor is similar to all other tenants of the building, and is not specific to his shop, and is only used by Peter as a means of convenience for his pizza deliveries and customers who park in the back common parking lot.

Even if Peter could argue that the noise and construction is a nuisance and hindering his business, Linda could argue that the construction and noise is only temporary, similar to the court's holding in the bank construction case, where the original tenant was liable for the remaining rent since the construction was only temporary, they were given access to all property outlined in the lease, and there was ultimately not partial/actual eviction as well as no constructive eviction.

a3e70c84-1d60-44d7-a28a-a40be680aa16," Q1. What kinds of interests were created by Dana's Conveyance and why? Dana (D) conveyed her interest to Eve (E) either as a Fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) or as a Fee simple subject to divestment (FSD). The language used is ""provided that"", which the courts tend to interrupt as a FSSCS but she also used the terms ""Only so long as"", which the courts see as FSD language. The rules of construction are, achieve the intent of the grantor, favor Fee simple absoulte (FSA), favor a FSSCS over a FSD, favor vested remainder over contigent remainder, dislike partial intestancy, want the freedom of alienability, and to look at the whole document for clairty. The issue here is not the intent of the grantor, which she explicitly states saying ""the house is not to be sold"". But rather if E has a FSD or a FSSCS and if Fioana (F) has any rights to reclaim the property from E if the stipulations of the conveyance were broken. Are there any arguements that Eve could make that she should be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre? The house was conveyed to E in either FSD or FSSCS but upon the death of D, it can be interpretted that E owns the proprty in FSA. The present interest has the responsibility to not create waste. There are 4 types of waste: Affirmative waste, where one voluntarily acts to lower the value of the propery (destruction), Perissive waste, where one's neglect to act causes the lowering of the value of the property, Amelortive waste, where one's acts actually increases the value of the propertty, and lastly economic waste, where the present interest is not using the property to its full value. Eve should be able to sell the property because it is in the best interest of the estate. Since we are going to say she has a FSA, she has the freddom to alienate the property as she sees fit. The courts would most likely look at the conveyance as a FSA since according to the rules they favor it. This is similar to how the courts interrpretted the conveynce in white v brown. Despite the conflicting interpretations, the court ruled that the house was given in FSA. FSA is favored because it has the most certainity. Even though the ruling in white v brown went aginst the ""intent of the grantor"", the majority opinion still felt that FSA was more proper. Similary, the court may also find in favor of FSA for E based on the same Eve should be able to sell the property because it is in the best interest of the estate. Since we are going to say she has a FSA, she has the freddom to alienate the property as she sees fit. The courts would most likely look at the conveyance as a FSA since according to the rules they favor it. This is similar to how the courts interrpretted the conveynce in white v brown.

Even though the ruling in white v brown went aginst the ""intent of the grantor"", the majority opinion still felt that FSA was more proper. Similary, the court may also find in favor of FSA for E based on the same rationale of favoring FSA. The worth of the home has natuallry increased and therefore not selling it would actually create economic waste. This is a similar arguemtnt to the one that was brought in Baker v Weedon. In that case, Anna wanted to sell the property to live off of and the grandkids did not, this is because by selling it, it would create economic waste. The reverse is true here, where not selling the property would create waste. The court ruled however, that the economic value of a property is not the sole factor to be looked at by the court. This was not only E's home but it was F's home for a long time and therefore an argument can be made against E in favor of F. So in order for E to be able to sell it, the court would need to rule similarly like it did in Baker, where it had the parties reach an agreement. The court felt that this was the fairest course of action. What Eve could argue here though is that when F left, she made it clear she had no interest in the proprty. Therefore, the sentimental after feelings are respectable, but the property was given to E and not to F leaving the final decsion to e to sell or not. Like in the woods v woodrick where there was compensation for the barn being torn down because the court ruled in favor of fairness, not because waste was created by the tearing down of the barn, the court could rule that F should be compensated some for the selling of the home. That the court still looks at sentimental value when making decisisons. Therefore, there is strong arguments in favor of E having the rights to sell the home and solict further offers to do so. Does Fiona have any basis for reclaming ownership of Blackacre and or for holding Eve accountable for the reapirs needed? According to the rules of constrution the courts like to favor FSSCS over an FSD. In this case, since Eve is attempting to sell the house the issue is if she automattically loses her interest in the property or if someone has to come in and reclaim it. Since the property would go back to the grantor if the condition there would be an automatic conveyance to the was broken this is an important point. If she has a3FSD, grantor who has a possibility of reverter (por) in fsa. If she has a FSSCS the grantor would have the power to terminate and the right of reentryin (roe) fsa. since D is dead, and she left all of her personal accountable for the reapirs needed? According to the rules of constrution the courts like to favor FSSCS over an FSD. In this case, since Eve is attempting to sell the house the issue is if she automattically loses her interest in the property or if someone has to come in and reclaim it. Since the property would go back to the grantor if the condition was broken this is an important point. If she has a FSD, there would be an automatic conveyance to the grantor who has a possibility of reverter (por) in fsa. If she has a FSSCS the grantor would have the power to terminate and the right of reentryin (roe) fsa. since D is dead, and she left all of her personal belongings to F, we can assume that F becomes the sole owner of the property and the she now owns it in FSA. This dilemma is similar to the school baord case, where the property was being sold to another but the issue was if the conveyance was either a FSSCS or A FSD and that if the limitation was broken was the property automatically go back to the grantor (POR) or if they had to go and reclaim it (ROE). Here, the court will need to also decide if F automatically regains control of the property or if she must go and reclaim her property first. Differing the 2 points are important because of the clock of Statute of limitations for adverse possession. If one has the right to property via POR, then the Adverse possession clock will start ticking as soon as the duarational condition was broken. In either instances, she has now reentered the property and is seeking to gain control again and E has not met the staute of limitations for the adverse possession and if E tries to sell the property, F will gain it. The courts favor FSSCS according to the rules of construction, but in the school board case they ruled it as an FSD. If she has a FSSCS the grantor would have the power to terminate and the right of reentryin (roe) fsa. since D is dead, and she left all of her personal belongings to F, we can assume that F becomes the acting ""grantor"" and therefore holds the POR or ROE in fsa. While eve owned the property she created three of the types of waste. She commited affirmitve waste When she voluntarily boarded up the house she made it so there was no activity for several years and this led to the destruction of the home. There is also the argument that there was permissive waste because she neglected to check up on the home and even though she continued to pay taxes on the home, her neglectful actions caused the house to have roof shingles missing, cracked glass, and other serious problems. Since she did not use the home to any value, this is ecomonomic waste. Amelotive waste was not an action she actually committed but because of the prime location her house rose in value does not mean her actions rose the property value. F can also argue that E abandons the premises when she moves to FL and that negates Es argument against saying that F didnt have an interest in the property originally. home, her neglectful actions caused the house to have roof shingles missing, cracked glass, and other serious problems. Since she did not use the home to any value, this is ecomonomic waste.

F can also argue that E abandons the premises when she moves to FL and that negates Es argument against saying that F didnt have an interest in the property originally. Since E was the acting present interest, and according to the idea that F was the future interest, it was the duty of the present interest to take care of the preimises and not to create waste. So there is an argument that E is accountable for all of the damage that was created by the present interest. Just like in the Woods v Woodrick case, the future interest had a say in what was to become of the property. The daughter wanted to stop the destruction of the barn, even though she had no present claim to the property, the court compensated her for ""her loss"". This is similar here, because even though at the time of all of the waste being created, broken glass and other house issues, F's future interest should still be protected. The court would most likely come to some monetary agreement in an attempt to satisfy both parties and create fairness. Therefore, if E tries to sell the home, F would either gain the estate through POR or a ROE and the court would most likely find that E would be required to fix, pay for, at least part of the damage created by the waste she created during her ownership. "," Q2. Peter Strengths & Laura Weaknesses When peter entered into the agreement, there was no disscussion of future construction, he had been renting for 12 years at this point without a problem. Due to the construction, he is not able to use the property in entirety as a landowner would be able to. Here, it is clear that peters right to Covenant of Quiet enjoyment (CQE) are being breached. CQE is the right for an owner to use the property as a true owner without the Land lord (LL) interfering. This When peter entered into the agreement, there was no disscussion of future construction, he had been renting for 12 years at this point without a problem. Due to the construction, he is not able to use the property in entirety as a landowner would be able to. Here, it is clear that peters right to Covenant of Quiet enjoyment (CQE) are being breached. CQE is the right for an owner to use the property as a true owner without the Land lord (LL) interfering. This situation is similar to the Reste case, where there was constant flooding and the company had to take measures to overcome the obstacles that were created by the LL being unresponsive to fix the defects causing the flooding. Here, the pizza shop has to have customers be inconvienced just to enter the premises, the general understanding of Pizzaries is the lack of effort it takes to obtain the food and therefore the ""Minor"" inconvience to customers has a ""major"" impact on peters revenue. The minor inconveinces are that the customers have to walk through a maze of of scaffolding, and the back door is blocked which he claims is causing there to be less customers and therefore impacting on his business. The court ruled in reste that the circumstances were so bad that it did qualify as a Constructive eviction. For there to be Constructive Eviction (CE) the elemenets need to be met: 1. Landlord (LL) must interfere with the occupants enjoyment of the property. 2. those interferences must be substantial. 3. the Tentant must notifiy LL and give reasonable amount of time to fix it. 4. the Tenenat must leave when things are not fixed. Despite Peter constantly calling teh LL to explain how the construction is unacceptable, she just keeps telling him why there are issues and the only remedy she is offering is a discount on his rent which is a small percentage of his rent. There is also an encroachment on his parking spot that makes it difficult for him to park there. This is similar to the Brick wall case, where even though the encroachment of the brick wall was minor, the courts ruled that it constituted an actual eviction becasue it is the Tenants right to have the entire property that they leased and paid for for. In this case, despite having access to other spots, that particular spot was part of his leased property, the courts could rule for an actual eviction. This is becasue the courts want to look at the fairness of the circumstances and they want to protect the Tenant and impose responsibilty on the LL. Since the lease agreement was for the whole property (his spot), it would be just for him to withold rent or like in the brick wall case, have a subsidized rent based on lost land. Therefore, the court could rule that there was an actual eviction, a construtive eviction (both cases Peter would not have to pay rent) or they could rule in favor of awarding Peter damages. Peter Weaknesses & Laura Strengths and impose responsibilty on the LL. Since the lease agreement was for the whole property (his spot), it would be just for him to withold rent or like in the brick wall case, have a subsidized rent based on lost land. Therefore, the court could rule that there was an actual eviction, a construtive eviction (both cases Peter would not have to pay rent) or they could rule in favor of awarding Peter damages. Peter Weaknesses & Laura Strengths Constructive eviction is not as easy to prove without substabtial inconviences to the tenant by the LL. The scaffold which largely blocks part of the door causing difficultly for customers and for pizza delieveries, with the difficulty of getting a car close to the back door are similar to the echo bank case, where the contruction forced the employees to go through construction, use a different door, and endure inconsistent construction noise. The court ruled that despite there being an inconvience for the employees, it did not constitute an actual CE because the lease did not specify that they had rights to certain doors. Here, similarly, the pizza place does have access to another door, they can still use the back door (even though it is annoying), there is still parking available. There are other options and it is possible for Peter to continue operating his pizza place. Peter can still use his own spot, and the white lines can be more of an estimate rather than actual guidelines to what property is his. Just like in the Manillo case with the encraoching stairs on the neighbors property, the encroachment is so minor, that the court felt there was a better solution than having to take down the stairs and here move the entire scafold. In the manillo case, the court ruled that it would be the most fair to all parties if they simply had the encraoching party pay for the land they were on. So in this case, there could be a monetary remedy or perhaps peter could even be given a different spot to park in. The court would most likely look to see what the LL is doing to help allievate the situation, because laura is actively comminucating with Peter, also mitigating his revenue damges by giving him a discount on his rent, the court would find that the LL was being reasonanly responsive. The fact pattern states that Laura has to make some repairs, not that she wants to, but ""has to"" and that could be an important point since it is the LL responsibilty to take care of the entire building and not just 1 unit (peters). There can even be an arguemnt made here that becaseu Peter closed his shop and left for a week, people are under the assumotion that he closed his shop and it is under cnstruction itself. It might have been his own actions that caused him to lose customers. laura is actively comminucating with Peter, also mitigating his revenue damges by giving him a discount on his rent, the court would find that the LL was being reasonanly responsive.

So in this case, it would not be unfound that the court may rule in favor of damages for Peter even if they do not support an actual CE. ",1872,1271
9737a924-b0c5-463a-996d-1cbb62746f9a," Dana, after passing away of her parents holds the property in Fee Simple absolute. she has the best title possible and can do whatever she pleases with the property. When she conveyed the property to Eve she held the proeprty in FSA. the language in the conveyance is either fee simple determinable because it uses the word of temporal limitation ""so long as"" or it is fee simple subject to condition subsequent because it uses conditional language such as ""provided that"". Fiona a the time of conveyance holds execitory interest in fee simple. Dana in this situation no longer holds reversion because if the condition of the conveyance is not violated then Eve will hold the property indefinetely, but i the condition is violated then Fiona can take over the proeprty in FSA, the property either way will transfered, there is no reversion or possibility of reverter held by Dana. Eve can only lose the proeprty if she violates the condition impossed by the will. At the time of Danas death, Dana no longer has any interest because dead people cant have interests post mortem. Fiona holds executory interest in fee simple. Executory interest is not like remainder where the interest holder waits patiently to assert her rights upon the natural end of the previous interest, here Fiona as soon as the condition is violated by Eve by attempting to sell the house has the right to enter the property and take over. Because of the vague language the court must look at the rues of construction and decide whether the grantor wanted to leave the property to Eve under Fee Simple determinable or under fee simple subject to condition sunsequent. In this situation the rules of constuction will govern the decision. The court must try to uphold the intent of the grantor and must look at the will in its entirety. The courts prefer fee simple subject to condition subesequent over determinable because it gives more felixibility to the parties. In fee simple determinable the property automatically will go to the interest holder if the condition is broken. when the condition is violated the the current tenant will automatically become a tresppasser. If its a condition subsequent than the person with executive interest must enter the property to take it over it does not automaticlly transfer. If Fiona decides to enter the property and take over upon vilation of the condition then she will hold the property in fee simple absolute and Eve will lose all interest. When Fiona arrives at the proeprty she finds it poor condition. In this situatuation as a future interest holder Fiona can claim that Eve has commited permissive waste. waste can be of several types. Affirmative waste when the current tenant decides to commit waste by removing structures, trees or decides to change the property in a way that it losses value. Permissive waste is when the current owner decides to enter the property and take over upon vilation of the condition then she will hold the property in fee simple absolute and Eve will lose all interest. When Fiona arrives at the proeprty she finds it poor condition. In this situatuation as a future interest holder Fiona can claim that Eve has commited permissive waste. waste can be of several types. Affirmative waste when the current tenant decides to commit waste by removing structures, trees or decides to change the property in a way that it losses value. Permissive waste is when the current owner allows the property to fall into despair by not paying taxes, not fixing the failing structures or allows the elemets to ruin the property without addressing the issues. Amelioratives waste when the owner adds to or subtracts something from the property that increases the value of the property, largely exctinct concept, very few jusrisdcitions use it today. And lastely economic waste, when the owner does not use the property in the most economicly profitable way possible. Such as using the existing mine, farm, structures and allows them to sit dormant. in this situation Eve has commited permissive waste by not fixing the property and allowing the house to fall into despair. As a future interest holder Fiona has a right to hold the current owner liable for allowing the structure to fall into depsair and can either to petition to enjoin the property or seek compensation. Enjoining the property means that Fiona can cut Eves life estate short and take over the property in FSA. Eve has paid the taxes which is part of her duties as the owner but she commited permissive waste by not fixing the structure. Eve can claim that taxes have been paid and she di not live on the property and that Fiona as a future interest holder has no right to seek compensation or enjoynement. but Fiona can claim that taxes are only part of her duties and does not relieve her of the duty to keep the house in good condition. By commiting permissive waste the property is has lesser value. Eve can claim that the offer she recived for the property clearly shows that the property is appreciated in value thus the permissive waste does not apply. Fiona can counter by saying that the property could have had higher value if it was not permitted to fall into despair. By the condition of the will Eve cant attempt to sell the house otherwise she will lose the rights to it. In this situation If Eve tries to sell the house Fiona can enter the property and excercise her right and cut Eves interest short. Even if Eve was able to sell the house the sale will be void because of the express condition in the will that bars her from attempting to sell the house. This will is very similar to White v Brown case where the grantor in her will did not want the property to be sold. But because the proeprty was left in very poor condition the court decided that sale of the property is the best scenario that will benefit all parties. Because the property has not been sold yet not any offers have been entertained Fiona cant yet enter the property and excercise her executive interest. As soon as Eve attempts to sell the property thats when Fiona san enter the property and take over. The issue here may be the meaning of attempt in the will. Does listening to the offer and being curious how much more she can fetch for the house constitute attempt to sell thus divesting her from the property or is it unsolicited White v Brown case where the grantor in her will did not want the property to be sold. But because the proeprty was left in very poor condition the court decided that sale of the property is the best scenario that will benefit all parties.

Does listening to the offer and being curious how much more she can fetch for the house constitute attempt to sell thus divesting her from the property or is it unsolicited offer that does not amount to attempt? "," Peter in this situation has a term of years lease with the lanlord. There are several types of leases, periodic lease that renews after ceratin period and requires at least 6 month notice of termination, term of years which has negotiated time in it, usually years but can be shorter or longer in duration. tenancy by will is when both lardlord and the tenant can terminate the lease at will at any time without prior notice and month to month lease which requires at least one month notice to terminate. If termination notice accours after the payment due date the tenant is on the hook for the next month as well because 30 day notice goes passed the due date of the next month. In this situation Peter holds term of years lease because it is 5 years. When Linda started doing repairs she gave the tenant prior notice of the duration of the repairs. But after coming back peter saw that the repairs are not finished and the dust and the construction equipment is hindering his business. This situation is similar to Echo consulting case where the bank started doing construction and the noise, dust and difficult access to the office made it difficult for Echo to conduct their busniess. In this situation the Linda is violating the covenant of quite enjoyement of the property. CQE protetcts the tenant from the encroachment from the landlord or his agents including the construction crews that work in its behalf. The tenant has the right to the whole property and the right to enjoy the property without hinderances. In this situation Linda through her construction crews is violating CQE by the noise, dust and the scaffolding that hinders the customers from entering the pizza shop. Peter in this situation can claim that he has been partially evicted from the property because some of the construction equipment is encroching on his parking spot, he has the right to use the parking lot and the common access and the designated parking spot as a whole, and that the construction is breaching the CQE. Peter can either withold the rent until the construction is finsided, withold part of the rent because he is losing money from the consruction or whole property and the right to enjoy the property without hinderances. In this situation Linda through her construction crews is violating CQE by the noise, dust and the scaffolding that hinders the customers from entering the pizza shop. Peter in this situation can claim that he has been partially evicted from the property because some of the construction equipment is encroching on his parking spot, he has the right to use the parking lot and the common access and the designated parking spot as a whole, and that the construction is breaching the CQE. Peter can either withold the rent until the construction is finsided, withold part of the rent because he is losing money from the consruction or close down his busines and claim constructive eviction. constructive eviction is when the conduct of the lanlord forces the tennant to leave the porperty and allows him seize paying the rent and terminates the lease. Unlike actual eviction where the lanlord termiantes the lease and evicts the tenant for failure to obide by lease terms or any other reason as in the restaurant case where the landlord entered the property with the sherrif because the lease did not allow any renovation, constructive eviction is when the conduct or lack there of by the landlord forces the tenant to leave the property as it was done in reste realty case where the constant flooding of the property forced the tenant to vacate the premises and seize the payments. In this situation peter has given linda ample ammout of notices and gave her enought time the fix the issue but to no avail. Similar to Echo consulting the court most likely will rule that even though there are persistent construction issues he is not being constructively evicted from the property and he cant teminate the lease but he is entitled to compensation for the business lost and breach of CQE minus the one week he was on vacation and for being partially evicted from the parking lot. Linda can claim that Peter has not being constructively evicted because he still has access regardless how difficult, she deducted $100 form the rent as compensation and did not have enough time to fix the issue. Peter can claim that he gave proper notice to the landlord, he was partially evicted from the leased property and that the landlord violated the CQE and the deduction in rent was not sufficient to compensate for the lost revenue. Peter can claim that the landlord had plenty of time to fix the issue which in this situation appers to be going on for months. The impleid warranty of habitability does not apply here because this is a commerical lease. IWH is a right that cant be surrendered by the tennant. The lanlord is required to deliver the premisses in habitable condition that does not create health and safety dangers to the tennant. the IWH must not be in the lease because it is implied without expressed language in the lease. the IWH is created so the lanlords cant manipulate the market and force poor individuals to live in bad conditions and exploting their dire financial situations by renting failed structures. The landlords have better understanding on how to fix the property because they usually know contractors and have the financial means to fix the property. The tenants must provide the landlord with proper notice of problems with the property, give him enough time to fix the property and if no action is taken by the landlord can either withold rent untill the issue is fixed, asked for the rent already paid, fix the issue and withhold the expenses from the rent or sue the landlord for the damages language in the lease. the IWH is created so the lanlords cant manipulate the market and force poor individuals to live in bad conditions and exploting their dire financial situations by renting failed structures.

It give Eve the property ""as long as"" she does not attempt to sell it. There is an uncertain event that could potentially terminate the present interest Eve has in the property. This event is if she attempts to sell the property. The grantor holds the futhre interest as possibility of reverter in fee simple absolute (FSA). In summary, Eve has present interest in Balckacre but when she ""attempts to sell the house"" the house will automatically revert to the grantor. "," If Eve (E) wants to solicit more buyers and look into the option of selling the property, her argument will be most strongly supported by the docrine of waste. Economic waste states that land is most valuable at its most productive state. The market value on the property has gone up due to its prime location in New Suffolk and and E can argue that it is in the best interest of the present interest holder- herself, to sell the house in the current market. The weakness in this argument is that Dana in her conveyance explicitly stated that ""the house is not to be sold."" This is similar to the conveyance in the handwritten conveyance in the White case where the grantor conveyed the house to her sister-in-law to live in, and stated that it is not to be sold. However, the rules of construction favors no restriction on alienability. The policy rational is that onwers should be free to make the best use out of the land they own. Here, although D explicitly stated that the house is not to be sold, E can argue that the rules of contruction favor free alienability and that if E sees that the property's value is most appreciated by alienating it, then she should be free to do so. The courts will try to determine what the best interest of all parties will be. Here, there are two parties. The present interest is Eve. Because the conveyance was a FSD, the future interest is held by the the rules of construction favors no restriction on alienability.

Because the conveyance was a FSD, the future interest is held by the possibility of revert by the grantor. In this case, the grantor Dana is deceased so, according to the general laws of New Suffolk, the interest the grantor had has been passed down to her issue who is Fiona (F). She has the future interest of possibility of reverter in FSA. This means that the moment the conition of ""not attempting to sell"" is violated, Blackacre automatically reverts back to the grantor. Fiona could argue that the moment Eve started to think about selling Blackacre, or when she did not reject the offer made by the real estate developer, the condition was violated. At this moment Eve was stripped of her ownership of Blackacre and the present interest reverted back to the grantor- Fiona. On the contrary, Eve could argue that she did not ""attempt"" to sell. All she did was think about it. ""Attempt"" requires a substantial step towards achiving that goal- in this case selling the house, so merely being curious about it does not satisfy ""attempt"" therefore the condition has not been violated and Eve still maintains the present interest in Blackacre. Eve want to sell the house, but Fiona wants to repair the house and move back in. This is a typical case where there is a conflict between the present interest and the future interest peosons. Like in the Weedon case where the life tenant wanted to sell the house to have money to support her old age living, E is interested in selling the property for financial gain. Like the remainders in the Weedon case, F is interested in preserving the property and moving back in. Another issue in the Weedon case was that the tax on the house and the cost in maintaining the house had become a burden on the life tenant and she was struggling to support her living. Eve could make a silimar argument claiming that she is paying taxed on the property but she is no longer living there and the tax and the maintanance fee is becoming a burden that she should not have to bear such burdern. The court, in Weedon came to a equitable division solution where, in considering the best interst of all parties suggested that the life tenant be allowed to sell a small portion of the house so that she could have money to sustain her living, but leave the rest of the property to for the remainders. Here, Fiona is interested in moving back into the house. Perhaps the best solution is for Fiona to become a tenant at Blackacre and start paying fair market rent to Eve, which she could use to pay taxes and maintain the property. One of the most valued term in the rule of construction is to favor the grantor's intent. Dana explicitly wanted to keep Blackacre within her family. This is why she conveyed the property to her cousin Eve in the first place. If this intent is to be division solution where, in considering the best interst of all parties suggested that the life tenant be allowed to sell a small portion of the house so that she could have money to sustain her living, but leave the rest of the property to for the remainders. Here, Fiona is interested in moving back into the house. Perhaps the best solution is for Fiona to become a tenant at Blackacre and start paying fair market rent to Eve, which she could use to pay taxes and maintain the property. One of the most valued term in the rule of construction is to favor the grantor's intent. Dana explicitly wanted to keep Blackacre within her family. This is why she conveyed the property to her cousin Eve in the first place. If this intent is to be preserved then the best solution would be to restrict alienability on Eve and let Fiona move as a tenant. If Eve and Fiona was to form a contractual landlord tenant relation for Blackacre, Fiona could argue that Eve is responsible for repairing the damages Blackacre has in order to put the property back into livable condition. The implied warranty of habitability, which applies strictly to residential properties states that the landlord (LL) is responsible for providing a residential space that is in compliance with the local housing code and meets its safety and health standard. This is a basic right of the tenant, which is impled in the standard lease agreement and this right cannot be waived by the tenant. Like in the Hilder case, the property is not in a livable condition at the moment. The foor shingles are missing, the glass is cracked and there are other serious issues. The LL is responsible for attending to th repairs because the LL is usually in a better financial situation to conduct the repairs and also has better knowledge about the property. Eve should be able to make repairs because she lived there when she was young and thus knows the property well. In the Hilder case, the tenant notified the LL about the necessary repairs but the LL was negligent in conducting them. In such case, the tenant has three options. She can stay and withhold rent, conduct the repairs and deduct the cost from rent or sue for damages. Here, if Eve is unwilling to conduct the repairs, perhaps Fiona can arrange for the repairs herself before moving in and deduct the cost from the the first month's rent once she moves in. Fiona can also argue that the present tenant is responsible for maintaining the property so that future interest can have it in the state it was left to them. As the holder of possibility of reverter, Fiona can claim permissive waste stating that Eve negligently managed the property and let it become unlivable. Eve had neglected it for five years and the property had deteriorated in that time. Fiona can sue for damages to put the property back to its original state as it was left by Dana. Question 2 There are multitudes of issues that Peter can raise as a tenant that will allow him to break the five year damages to put the property back to its original state as it was left by Dana. Question 2 There are multitudes of issues that Peter can raise as a tenant that will allow him to break the five year lease he has with Linda. Firstly, Peter can argue that there has been a breach in the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The CQE states that the tenant has the right to quietly enjoy the benefitial use of the rented premises. The landlord (LL) is responsible for protecting this use and the tenant, during the lease should not be interfered by the LL's actions in anyway. Traditionally, this provision protected tenants from those with paramount title to the premises like the bank that the LL has morgage with or an adverse possessor who has claimed title to the land. However, the modern view is that the CQE encompasses beneficial use of the premises such as protecting tenants from noise pollution or any disturbance from other tenants in the building. Like the the Reste case, where the premises flooded every time it rained and interfered with the business activities the tenant was conducting in the property, Peter can argue that the construction is severly interfering with his ability to conduct business as usual. The scaffolding is deterring customers away by making entry into the building difficult and is also making pizza deliveries challenging and the noise and the dust is making a pizza restaurant unfavorable to the customers. Who wants to eat at a place where there is constant noice and dust. Similar to the Echo case, where the construction noise was interfering with their everyday use of the property, the construction has interefered with his busniess to a point where his revenues are down. From a policy standopint, the modern lease is like a contract where the LL and the tenant have mutual obligations. The LL is responsible for providing a space that is usable or livable and attending to resolve issues that interfere with the rights tenant has in using that property. On the other hand, the tenant is responsible for paying the rent. Where there is a breach on either of the parties, the other is released from their obligation as well. Here, Peter can argue that the construction situation became so bad that it interfered with his business too much and therefore, it is like the property has become unsuable. In such case, the tenant can claim constructive eviction. This is when the problem with the property is so substantial so that it has rendered the property unusable. In order to claim constructive eviction there must be a substantial issue, the LL must have been notified of the issue and give reasonable 8 time to fix the probelm and then the tenant must abandoned the property. Similarly in the Reste case, the flooding becase so substantial that the tenant was no longer able to use the property for her business purposes. Here, the revenue had gone Peter can argue that the construction situation became so bad that it interfered with his business too much and therefore, it is like the property has become unsuable. In such case, the tenant can claim constructive eviction. This is when the problem with the property is so substantial so that it has rendered the property unusable. In order to claim constructive eviction there must be a substantial issue, the LL must have been notified of the issue and give reasonable time to fix the probelm and then the tenant must abandoned the property. Similarly in the Reste case, the flooding becase so substantial that the tenant was no longer able to use the property for her business purposes. Here, the revenue had gone down because of the construction. He had fewer customers. Peter can argue that nevertheless, he had been patient and had tried to tolerate the situation for months, but the situation had not been resolved. This is similar to the Reste case where the tenant patiently tried to find ways to tolerate the situation while continuing to report the to LL of the problems. Peter also continued to call Linda everyweek to remind her that the situation needed to be resolved. He can also point to the fact that Linda had initially stated that the construction will only last a week. In the Reste case, there was a ""Crowning Blow"" where the flooding was too much and she had to move the a business meeting elsewhere. After this, she notified the LL and abandoned the property. Based on this, Peter can argue that he had waited for months for the situation to be resolved but the crowning blow was the report that proved the revenue of his business had gone down and this was evience that the property was no longer usable as a pizza place. This is like being evicted by the landlord because the LL caused the construction, therefore she rendered the rental space unusable. If Peter claims constructive eviction, he can terminate the lease and thus is relieved from his duty to pay rent up to December 31, 2023. Linda can argue that in order to cliam constructive eviction, Peter must abandone the premises. He had not left yet, therefore the situation must not be as bad as he claims it to be. The landlord in the Reste case was negligent and did not respond at all to the tenant's complaints. On the contrary, Linda is very responsive and even sympathetic to Peter's situation. She deducted $100 from the rent in recognition for the situation. She is laso communicating with the developer and giving Peter updates about the construction situation. Linda can also argue that there is no proof that the decrease in revenue is entirely due to the construction. Perhaps Peter's pizza is just not good anymore because he changed some ingredients in the pizza. She can argue that the customers will not be deterred by a little challenge in getting to the pizza place if they really wanted to eat there. Therefore, Peter cannot claim constructive eviction because the seriousness of the interference does not rise to the level of being ""so substantial"". The premises is still usable. In that case Peter is still responsible for the rent upto December 21, 2023. rent at any point before then. Linda can sue for recovery of the rent is he stops paying Peter can counter argue that as a landlord, Linda has duty to mitigate the damages, meaning she has to ingredients in the pizza. She can argue that the customers will not be deterred by a little challenge in getting to the pizza place if they really wanted to eat there. Therefore, Peter cannot claim constructive eviction because the seriousness of the interference does not rise to the level of being ""so substantial"". The premises is still usable. In that case Peter is still responsible for the rent upto December 21, 2023. Linda can sue for recovery of the rent is he stops paying rent at any point before then. Peter can counter argue that as a landlord, Linda has duty to mitigate the damages, meaning she has to try to re-lese the property before she can sue for recovery of rent. Kridel states that even if the tenant defaults on rent, the LL has the duty to put good faith effor into mitigating the damages. This could be through trying to re-lease the apartment by relisting it in the market, advertising it, showing it to prospective tenants and so forth. There is no set formula, but it is on the burden of the LL to provide evidence of good faith effort. Peter can argue that she should try to look for other interested tenants. Who knows, perhaps there could be someone who can use it as office to whom easy access to the building is not as important as it is for Peter's business. From a policy standpoint, a property should not be wasted and should always be put to most productive use. The LL has a resposiblilty in trying to accomplish this rational. Peter can also claim partial eviction on his parking spot. the construction equiptment has encroached on Peter's designated parking spot. This spot in particular is assigned to Peter in the lease, so he can argue that it is included in the $2000 rent he is paying. The situation is like in the Smith case where the LL built a fence that encroached onto the tenant's leased premises. This physical encroachment was considered as partial eviction. The rational is that the tenant is paying rent to use the premises as a whole and the this cannot be approportionated, thus, eviction from part of it is eviction from all. The court in that case ruled that the rent can be suspended. However, a more modern and reasonable solution would be to renegotiate to decrease the rent to reflect the encroachment. Linda can argue that she already deducted $100 from the rent, but Peter can argue that this was to refelct the inconvenience the construction has caused and not for the physical encroachment. Linda could also argue that Peter can still squeez into the parking space so the space is still usable. This does not matter based on the policy rational because the issue is whether there was a physical encroachment or not and not about the usability of the space. ",109,2961
6dfac62a-26c6-4c69-afe0-39aa1b1a3e44," What kinds of interests were created by Dana's conveyance, and why? Because the conveyance is ambiguous, Eve is either entitled to a fee simple determinable interest or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Again the ambiguity also changes whether Dana has a possibility of reverter or a right of re-entry. In a right of re-entry situation, Dana would have to assert her power of termination. The conveyance contains both durational and conditional language such as ""provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house."" For these reasons one must look at the Rules of Construction to determine which interest Eve holds. Per the Rules of Construction classifying conveyances should best achieve the interests of the grantor, i.e. Dana, and fee simple subject to condition subsequent is favored over fee simple determinable. Dana wants to keep Blackacre in her family and adamantly does not want Blackacre to be sold, so for these reasons, the conveyance only sought to give Eve a fee simple subject to condition subsequent interest and Dana retained the right of re-entry. However, this case could be an exception to the Rules of Construction, like the Mahrenholz case was, in which the court chose to favor fee simple determinable over fee simple subject to condition subsequent because they only intended for the conveyance to last so long as it was used as a school. The exception could possibly apply here because Dana only wants to have family living on Blackacre so long as they don't sell the land. Are there any arguments that Eve could make that she should be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre? The conveyance suggests that so long as Eve is living on Blackacre she should not be able to sell the house. However, Eve has not lived on Blackacre for five years and has sinced moved to Florida. She still pays real estate taxes but she has locked up the house. Eve could argue that she never violated the condition subsequent and as an interest holder in Blackacre she should be allowed to solicit offers. Soliciting offers also does not imply that Eve will sell; she could merely be inquiring about the value of Blackacre. If Eve were to pay for the repairs to Blackacre, it is possible that the value of the house would rise as well. Fiona could argue that Eve is close to violating her condition subsequent because she is considering soliciting other offers. The conveyance specifically states that ""only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house."" Dana did not intend for Eve to sell Blackacre and thus this boost still pays real estate taxes but she has locked up the house. Eve could argue that she never violated the condition subsequent and as an interest holder in Blackacre she should be allowed to solicit offers. Soliciting offers also does not imply that Eve will sell; she could merely be inquiring about the value of Blackacre. If Eve were to pay for the repairs to Blackacre, it is possible that the value of the house would rise as well. Fiona could argue that Eve is close to violating her condition subsequent because she is considering soliciting other offers. The conveyance specifically states that ""only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house."" Dana did not intend for Eve to sell Blackacre and thus this boost Fiona's argument for reclaiming ownership. Does Fiona have any basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre and/or for holding Eve accountable for the repairs needed on Blackacre? Prior to leaving college, Fiona lived on Blackacre for 18 years. According to Dana's will, Fiona inherits all her personal property. Even if Dana hadn't written a will, per New Suffolk General Laws, ""said property shall first be distributed to issue."" Issue is another word for lineal family members such as children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren. Again if the will wasn't written, Fiona, as an issue of Dana, would still inherit Blackacre. Since there is a will that specifically states that Fiona should inherit all of Dana's personal property, then regardless of this law, Fiona should inherit Blackacre. Eve could argue that personal property is ambiguous and might only apply to Dana's chattel, not necessarily her real property, i.e. Blackacre, which she conveyed to Eve in 2010. Eve could also argue that she has a stronger sentimental attachment than Fiona does because she moved in with Dana's family onto Blackacre when she was young and was conveyed the property when Dana moved to Switzerland. Similar to Arkland where the court determines that sentimental attachment should be a consideration when deciding whether to partition in kind or by sale, the court could apply the sentimental attachment factor here but use it towards deciding whether Eve should be able to sell the house or whether Fiona should be able to live on Blackacre again. Eve could also argue that Fiona's sentimental attachment is less because she had no interest in returning to New Suffolk in 2010 when Dana originally conveyed Blackacre, nor has she lived on Blackacre in 16 years and it is not until now that she all of a sudden she feels very sentimental about Blackacre. To that point, Fiona could argue that Eve has basically relinquished her connection to Blackacre because she has not lived there in five years and her payments of the real estate taxes are on auto-pay and require no further action on her part. It also seems that Fiona wanting to move back to Blackacre is solely contingent on whether Eve would pay for the repairs. With regards to holding someone accountable for 6 repairs, Fiona could argue that per the idea of the permissive waste, in which a present interest holder has lasped in their upkeep of the property, Eve should be accountable for the repairs of the missing shingles and cracked windows. This is not an relinquished her connection to Blackacre because she has not lived there in five years and her payments of the real estate taxes are on auto-pay and require no further action on her part. It also seems that Fiona wanting to move back to Blackacre is solely contingent on whether Eve would pay for the repairs. With regards to holding someone accountable for the repairs, Fiona could argue that per the idea of permissive waste, in which a present interest holder has lasped in their upkeep of the property, Eve should be accountable for the repairs of the missing shingles and cracked windows. This is not an example of affirmative, ameliorative or economic waste, because Eve did not do anything to increase the value of the property, diminish the productivity of the property, nor did she voluntary act in damaging the property, she merely left it alone. Eve could argue that because Fiona was not an interest holder when Dana conveyed Blackacre to her, Fiona has no right to decide who is accountable for repairing what. A possible equitable solution would be to classify Eve and Fiona as tenants in common, who hold concurrent interests in Blackacre. From there a discussion of partition in kind - dividing up the land equally between Eve and Fiona - or partition by sale - selling Blackacre and distributing the profits among Eve and Fiona - could be had. In this scenario, Eve could solicit offers to drive up the price of Blackacre so long as she agree to make the necessary repairs. Fiona would get Blackacre in its original form, i.e. what it was like when it was conveyed, and they could decide amongst themselves whether to possibly partition in kind or partition by sale. "," Peter's legal rights and options. What are the strengths and weaknesses of any claims that he can make? (issues Linda would raise) As the tenant of a term of years lease, Peter is required to pay his rent from January 1, 2019 until December 31, 2023 at $2,000 a month and he is required to not breach the lease. As the landlord, Linda is required to make all necessary repairs and keep the building up to health and safety codes. If Linda breaches the lease, Peter is not on the hook for rent. If Peter breaches the lease, he is required to pay rent for the entire term of years lease. If Peter's covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached, i.e. if Linda interferes with his enjoyment of the property set out in his lease, he could bring a suit for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment and argue that he was actually evicted, he was constructively evicted, or that while his breach wasn't substantial, he should at least be entitled to damages. Peter could argue that he was actually evicted because the construction equipment encroached on his designated parking spot. Per the lease, Peter was provided one designated parking spot. Similar to the breaches the lease, Peter is not on the hook for rent. If Peter breaches the lease, he is required to pay rent for the entire term of years lease. If Peter's covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached, i.e. if Linda interferes with his enjoyment of the property set out in his lease, he could bring a suit for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment and argue that he was actually evicted, he was constructively evicted, or that while his breach wasn't substantial, he should at least be entitled to damages. Peter could argue that he was actually evicted because the construction equipment encroached on his designated parking spot. Per the lease, Peter was provided one designated parking spot. Similar to the Smith v. McEnany case in which the brick wall infringed upon the enjoyment of the property, amounting to actual eviction, Peter could argue that he is being actually evicted from his designated parking spot. Linda could argue that this so-called eviction is not substantial whatsoever because Peter admits that he can still park in the spot. If Peter argues actual eviction he must vacate the premises immediately. If he were to use this option, I might recommend that he put his rent money in escrow in case the court decides that he is still on the hook to pay the rent for the rest of the term of years lease. Peter could also argue that he was constructively evicted because the scaffolding largely blocked access to the rear door, the construction is noisy and Peter is unable to open his windows because of the dust. The rear door is helpful for customers who park in the lot and for delivery-people to pull up cars and make pizza deliveries faster. Per his lease, Peter has common use of the parking lot. Peter could use the holding from Reste Realty in which Mrs. Cooper's business was significantly hindered by the flooding and amounted to constructive eviction. The construction in this case has led to less customers coming to Peter's pizza shop and slower pizzer deliveries, thus his profits have gone down. Peter could also argue that the construction is being down on the exterior of the building, which is not necessarily a part of his lease. Again, Reste Realty showed us that the flooding was because of an issue with the building that was not a part of the lease that Mrs. Cooper signed and thus she was entitled to constructive eviction and so should Peter in this case. Linda could use the holding from Echo Consulting in which Echo was blocked from using the front entrance door but because they still had access to the back door they were only entitled to damages. Per Linda's argument, Peter's lease gives him ""common right of access thereto."" The lease doesn't specify which door Peter is given access to, merely that he has access to entering and leaving his pizza shop, which he does from the front door even with the ongoing construction. Linda could also argue that Peter's customers still have access to the back door, they just might have to navigate a little scaffolding. If Peter argues constructive eviction he usually must vacate the premises. He must also give the 6 the landlord reasonable time to fix the landlord a reasonable notice of the repairs as well 5asofgive problems. Linda said the repairs should only take a week or so. However, months have passed and the repairs are still ongoing and are correlated to Peter's loss in revenue. Peter has give reasonable notice merely that he has access to entering and leaving his pizza shop, which he does from the front door even with the ongoing construction. Linda could also argue that Peter's customers still have access to the back door, they just might have to navigate a little scaffolding. If Peter argues constructive eviction he usually must vacate the premises. He must also give the landlord a reasonable notice of the repairs as well as give the landlord reasonable time to fix the problems. Linda said the repairs should only take a week or so. However, months have passed and the repairs are still ongoing and are correlated to Peter's loss in revenue. Peter has give reasonable notice by asking Linda every single week when the repairs will be finished and he has given her a reasonable amount of time to fix them. A week or so is not the same timeframe as months and thus Peter could argue constructive eviction because Linda breached the lease by evicting Peter from the common use of the parking lot and thus he should vacate the premises. Again, Linda could argue that Peter is only entitled to damages because his interference was not so substantial that his use of entire the property was significantly hindered. Peter could argue for damages, because while the scaffolding and construction equipment is a bother, customers still have a means to enter the pizza shop and the ongoing construction is not permanent. Linda has also recognized that the construction is an incovenience by deducting $100 from Peter's monthly rent. ",1281,1054
d6db68eb-a97f-49b6-b974-8146d81c7417," Essay 1 1a. Interests Created in Conveyance Dana: The first issue to determine is if Dana retained a future interest in Blackacre when she gave the property to her cousin Eve. Dana conveyed the property Eve, which means that she gave the property to Eve. In the conveyance, Dana indicated that Eve must not sell the house. The accompanying rule is that the grantor of the property maintains a reversion if he or she does not give away the interest in question with certainty. In this situation, Dana did not give her interest away with certainty to Eve because of the stipulation that Eve should not attempt to sell the house. Therefore, Dana maintains a future interest in Blackacre. The type of interests will be discussed below. Eve: Eve received the land from Dana. The issue here is determining what kind of interest Eve has. There are three types of present interests, which are: fee simple determinable, fee simple subject to condition subsequent and fee simple subject to executory limitation. Fee simple determinable is classified by durational language such as ""so long as,"" fee simple subject to condition subsequent is classified by conditional language such as ""provided that"" and fee simple subject to executory interest can be classified by either durational or conditional language. The focus is on the exeuctory interest, which means that the interest is held by a third party and someone other than the grantor. In this situation, Dana used the language ""provided that and only so long as,"" which are two phrases that are used for two different types of present interests. Therefore this language is unclear as to what type of conveyance Dana intended. Since the language in Dana's will is unclear, this means that is is an ambiguous conveyance. For ambiguous conveyances, there are rules of construction that help figure out what the grantor intended with the will. Rules of construction state that the conveyances should be read to favor a fee simple absolute. However, given the piece about preventing from selling the land, there is no fee simple absolute. Another rule of construction, is that the conveyance should be read to favor a fee simple two different types of present interests. Therefore this language is unclear as to what type of conveyance Dana intended. Since the language in Dana's will is unclear, this means that is is an ambiguous conveyance. For ambiguous conveyances, there are rules of construction that help figure out what the grantor intended with the will. Rules of construction state that the conveyances should be read to favor a fee simple absolute. However, given the piece about preventing from selling the land, there is no fee simple absolute. Another rule of construction, is that the conveyance should be read to favor a fee simple subject to condition subsequent instead of a fee simple determinable. Therefore, the language in the conveyance should be classified as this,which means that Eva has a fee simple subject to conditon subsequent. Fiona: Since Eve has a fee simple subject to coniditon subsequent, this means that Dana would have had a future interest called a right of entry/pwoer of termination. Dana has since died.Other rules of construction are that the conveyance should be read in a way that most closely alligns with the grantor's intent and in a way that prevents partial intestacy. As grantor, Dana initially wanted Blackacre to go her daughter, Fiona, who had the time did not want it since Dana wanted Fiona to have the property it is likely that she would want her future interest to go to her daughter. Additionally, Fiona inherited all of Dana's personal property. There is no mention of the exact language of Dana's will, which could be helpful to determinining what Dana's intent was. Dana's personal property is different from her real property. Real propery is land whereas personal property is everything else. Since conveyances should be read to prevent partial intestacy and Dana initially wanted to give Blackacre to Fiona, it is likely to assume that Dana also intended to give Fiona her future interest in Blackacre and as Dana's daughter, Fiona is her issue and inherits her future interest. Therefore, Fiona now has the right of entry/power of termination that was once her mother's future interest. 1b. Eve's arguments for selling Blackacre Eve has ownership of Blackacre when she receives a call from a real estate developer offering to purchase Blackacre, and wants to know if she has any arguments that she can make that would allow her to be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre. In the coveyance where Dana conveyed Blackacre to Eve, she specifically mentioned that the property should not be sold. However, Eve could make the argument that the property is not being used and therefore is waste. Property law generally intends to prevent waste, which could give Eve an argument for selling. At this period he property is sitting in permissive waste, which means that Eve has been negiligent and has failed to Eve has ownership of Blackacre when she receives a call from a real estate developer offering to purchase Blackacre, and wants to know if she has any arguments that she can make that would allow her to be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre. In the coveyance where Dana conveyed Blackacre to Eve, she specifically mentioned that the property should not be sold. However, Eve could make the argument that the property is not being used and therefore is waste. Property law generally intends to prevent waste, which could give Eve an argument for selling. At this period he property is sitting in permissive waste, which means that Eve has been negiligent and has failed to maintain the property. Eve could use the case with elderly woman whose husband died and had conveyed the property to her and if she died without children to his grandchildren who unfortunately found out about the property through developers. In that the case, part of the property was eventually sold despite the conveyance of the land indicating that the property was not sold. 1c. Fiona's basis for reclaiming interest in Blackacre and holding Eve accountable As discussed above, Fiona has an interest in Blackacre. Fiona could make the arugment that since she inherited the interest from Dana, she is now the rightful interest holder for the right of entry associated with Eve's fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Assuming that Fiona knows about the call from the real estate developer, she can exercise her right of entry and claim Blacackre from Eve because she violated Dona's condition by attempting to sell the property. Therefore, Fiona can claim ownership of Blackacre. Additionally, on the issue of Fiona holding Eve accountable for the state of the building on Blackacre, Fiona does have a claim. The rule is that the present interest holder has a duty to maintain the property so that the future interest holder will receive the property in the condition it was in when the present interest holder received it. Since Eve was negligent and did not perform any upkeep or maintence of Blackacre, it is not in the condition it was in when Eve received it. Therefore, Fiona can hold Eve accountable for the repairs on Blackacre. This is brought up in the barn case where the present interest holder wanted to knock it down because it would increase the value of the property, but the future interest holder did not want it knocked down and eventually sued for this recovering money for the barn Therefore, it is likely that Fiona will also be able to seek legal action for the condition of Blackacre and be successful in this claim. "," Essay 2 2a. Strengths Peter has been leasing a space for his pizza shop in a commcercial buidling owned by Linda for 5 years when she begins construction to repair the outside of the building, which is taking longer than inticipated. The first issue to determine if Linda can be held resonsible for the construction. The rule is that if a party is acting on behalf of the landlord then the landlord is responsible. Linda is the landlord and Linda hired the contractor to complete construction on the exterior of the building where Peter is leasing the space, so therefore Linda can be held liable for this issues. The next issue is to determine if Linda acting in capacity of the landlord has breached the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (CQE), which is implied in all leases. The covenant of quiet enjoyment requires that the landlord will furnish the property to the tenant and will not interfere with the tenant's use of the entire property that he or she has rented. In this situation, the construction equipment is interferring with Peter's designated parking space which is mentioned in the lease and the construction is leading to a decrease of sales. The nex tissue is to determine if the encroachment into the parking space constitutes a breach of the CQE. For this claim, he can turn to the concept of partial actual eviction, which means that eviction from part of the land constitutes being evicted from all of it. He can use the Boston Wagon case for support. In the this case, the court held that an encroachment by the landlord onto the tenant's property led to partial actual eviction and therefore constructive eviction of the tenants from the property and that the tenants were not responsible for rent because the rent is charged for the entire land and cannot be aportioned. The landlord built a wall that encroached on the property and prevented the tenants from being able to store as many wagons on the property as they could before, which led to a decline in revenue and eventually an inability to pay rent. Peter can use this case to support his claim because like the tenants in the Boston Wagon case, the landlord's encroachment led to issues with his business. His designated parking spot is now a tight squeeze for his car and construction has led to a decline in revenue. Additionally, in the Echo Consulting case, the tenants also dealt with construction issues. The court held in this case that the construction was temporary and that since the construction interferred with the common areas, the tenants could not argue that were constructively or partially evicted from the property. However, unlike in that case, Peter's lease specifically mentions that he has a designated revenue and eventually an inability to pay rent. Peter can use this case to support his claim because like the tenants in the Boston Wagon case, the landlord's encroachment led to issues with his business. His designated parking spot is now a tight squeeze for his car and construction has led to a decline in revenue. Additionally, in the Echo Consulting case, the tenants also dealt with construction issues. The court held in this case that the construction was temporary and that since the construction interferred with the common areas, the tenants could not argue that were constructively or partially evicted from the property. However, unlike in that case, Peter's lease specifically mentions that he has a designated parking spot and this is spot that has been encroached upon. Since Linda is responsible for the construction, and the construction has lead to both an encroachment on his leased property and a decline in revenue sales, it is likely that he could argue the construction has caused him to be partially evicted. However, there are also some weaknesses to this argument. In the Boston Wagon case the encroachment was directly related to the decline in revenue. In this case, the encroachment into Peter's parking space does not directly relate to his decline in rent. Additionally, in the Echo Consulting case, the court held that the construction was temporary and this meant that the construction was not enough for eviction. SInce, Peter has a strong claim that he the construction has lead to breach of CQE and therefore partial eviction, Peter's next step would be to leave and then bring his claim. Before Peter can leave the leased property, has to notify the landlord of the issue, give the landlord reasonable time to fix the issue, and if after a reasonable period of time the issue has not fixed then he can go. In order to notify the landlord of the issue, Peter must bring the issue to Linda. When Linda first notified Peter of the issue she said it would only take a week or two. When Peter returned the construction was still going on. At this point, the construction has gone on for months. Peter has called Linda every week to figure out why the construction is taking so long and every week she gives him an answer. However, there appears to be no indication of when the construction will end and it is interfering with his business because there are fewer customers and his staff are having trouble making the pizza deliveries on time, which means that revenue is down. As long as Peter has made it clear to Linda how the construction is affecting his business, he could argue that Linda has breached the CQE. Since Peter has called Linda multiple times and the construction is still on going, Peter could argue that he has given Linda reasonable time to fix the issue. Linda has decreased his rent by $100 a month as a way to remedy the issue, but Peter is dealing with revenue loss and it is unclear if the amount of money that Linda has decreased the rent by makes up for the decrease in revenue. The construction was supposed to take a week or so, but now that it has been months and the construction is on going and he the pizza deliveries on time, which means that revenue is down. As long as Peter has made it clear to Linda how the construction is affecting his business, he could argue that Linda has breached the CQE. Since Peter has called Linda multiple times and the construction is still on going, Peter could argue that he has given Linda reasonable time to fix the issue. Linda has decreased his rent by $100 a month as a way to remedy the issue, but Peter is dealing with revenue loss and it is unclear if the amount of money that Linda has decreased the rent by makes up for the decrease in revenue. The construction was supposed to take a week or so, but now that it has been months and the construction is on going and he has no way of knowing when the construction will end. As discussed in the Boston Wagon case above there is also a possibility that Peter will not be able to pay rent if the decline in revenue is more than the decrease in rent. Given these issues, Peter could leave and argue that Linda has breached the CQE. If Peter is successful in his claim that Linda has breached CQE then he will not have to pay rent for the remaining months on his lease. ",1289,1240
05ab5f67-d7d3-441f-8d3c-e879ece151f9," This situation is very similar to the situation we read about in White. Here, it is evident that though Dana cared about her cousing Eve, she primarily cared about preventing the house on Blackacre from being sold. First, we look at the interests that were created by Dana's conveyance to Eve The langugage that Dana used to convey Blackacre to Eve are unfortunately ambiguous because Dana employs language that could be interpreted to have conveyed Blackacre to Eve in Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent in FSA or Fee Simple Determinable in FSA. FSSCS is easily distinguished by language that imposes a potential defeasance condition by using terms that express that condition such as ""I convey Blackacre to A provided that...X condition,"" ""I convey Blackacre to A if...X condition,"" or most clearly, ""I convey Blackacre to A on the condition that..."" Here, at the beginning of the conveyance, Dana uses ""I hereby convey Blackacre to E, provided that...Eve does not attempt to sell the house."" Thus the, condition here is that E not sell the house rendering this a Fee Simple to Condition Subsequent. FSD is distinguished by language that imposes a potential defeasance condition that uses durational terms such as ""I convey Blackare to A so long as...X condition,"" ""I convey Blackacre to A until....X Condition."" Here, because Dana also used durational language in the conveyance, when she stated ""I hereby convey Blackacre to my cousin, E, provided that and only so long as E does not attempt to sell the house,"" one could also see that Dana employed langugae that would create in Eve a Fee Simple Determinable in Fee Simple Absolute interest. As a result, we could conclude that E's interest is either FSSCS or FSD in FSA and that this is an ambiguous conveyance. Next, we look at the interests that other parties might have, namely: Dana and her daughter Fiona: Because both FSSCS and FSD hinge on a potential defeasance condition, both conveyances allow the grantor to keep an interest. FSSCS usually means that the grantor has a future interest called the Power of Termination (POT) or Right of Entry (ROE) which is an active interest that allows the grantor, once As a result, we could conclude that E's interest is either FSSCS or FSD in FSA and that this is an ambiguous conveyance. Next, we look at the interests that other parties might have, namely: Dana and her daughter Fiona: Because both FSSCS and FSD hinge on a potential defeasance condition, both conveyances allow the grantor to keep an interest. FSSCS usually means that the grantor has a future interest called the Power of Termination (POT) or Right of Entry (ROE) which is an active interest that allows the grantor, once the condition imposed has been met/violated to re-enter the premises that have been conveyed (in this case Blackacre). FSD, in turn, implies that the grantor maintains a future interest called the Possibility of Reverter, which is a more passive interest in that if the condition imposed has been met/violated, then the grantor would automatically be granted the interest in the property at the moment that violation of condition occurred. Because the interest does not require the grantor to actively enter the property, it is simply triggered, we could consider this interest to be more passive. Thus, at the moment that D conveyed Blackacre to E, depending on how the court read the conveyance (more on this later), Dana would either have the possibility of reverter (if E has FSD) or power of termination/right of entry (if E has FSSCS). The next question, given that D dies, is whether F has any future interest in Blackacre. Here, one could argue that because D inherited to her dautgher F all of her personal property, it is clear that D wanted F to inherit all the property that was Dana's. Thus, F could make an argument that F is the natural ""inheritor"" of either D's POT/ROE or Possibility of Reverter. F could further strengthen her argument by pointing at the language of D's conveyance of Blackacre to E and noting that the conveyance does not state anywhere that upon D's death, the condition that the house is not to be sold is ""removed."" From the language of the conveyance, F could argue that D wanted that potential defeasance condition to always remain, even when D died. Thus, F could argue that the logical next step, because D gave F all of her personal property, is that F should inherit that accompanying future interest so that if the defeasance condition is met and E tried to attempt to sell the house, then F should be able to get Blackacre (either via POT/ROE or Possibility of Reverter). However, the instructions that we have been provided regarding the laws of New Suffolk may give Eve a powerful counter argument as to whether Fiona has any interest: namely, that New Suffolk General Laws state that every grant or devise of real estate, or any interest therein, shall pass all the estate/interest of the grantor/deviros, unless the intent to pass a less estate or itnerst shall appear by express terms, or Here, Eve could point to the document and be necessarily implied in the terms of the instrument."" emphasize its ambiguity. Much like the argument that was made in the White case, if D had wanted F to retain that future interest, she would have said so; it is evident that Dana is familiar + able to make gifts However, the instructions that we have been provided regarding the laws of New Suffolk may give Eve a powerful counter argument as to whether Fiona has any interest: namely, that New Suffolk General Laws state that every grant or devise of real estate, or any interest therein, shall pass all the estate/interest of the grantor/deviros, unless the intent to pass a less estate or itnerst shall appear by express terms, or be necessarily implied in the terms of the instrument."" Here, Eve could point to the document and emphasize its ambiguity. Much like the argument that was made in the White case, if D had wanted F to retain that future interest, she would have said so; it is evident that Dana is familiar + able to make gifts and conveyances; not only did she convey Blackacre to E, but she also made a will to give all of her personal property to F. Because the document does not expressly provide that F is to have the future interest and it does not imply that in the conveyance document, then E could argue that D did not intend for F to keep the future accompanying interest to Blackacre. F, however, could further argue that according to the laws of N. Suffolk, if the property of a deceased person is not distributed according to will or other instrument, then said property shall first be distributed to issue, then to ancestors, and then to collateral relatives. F could argue that because there is no instrument that describes to whom the property will go to if the defeasance condition is met, then N. Suffolk should give her priority since she is after all the daughter (issue) whereas Eve is only a collateral relative because she is a cousin and thus at the bottom of the distribution list. E, could counter by saying that the conveyance is a writtten instrument and once again highlight that D could have written out another one spelling out that F would get Blackacre if she so wanted and actually intended for it to be that way. Arguments that Eve could make that she should be permitted to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre E could make the argument that because the conveyance employs ambgiuous language, the court should thus look at the 7 rules of construction for ambiguous conveyances. These are: 1) Courts must look at grantor's intent 2) Courts favor Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent over Fee Simple Determinable 3) Fee Simple Absolute favoured the most 4) Avoid partial intestacy 5) Favor vested remainders over contingent remainders 2) Courts favor Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent over Fee Simple Determinable 3) Fee Simple Absolute favoured the most 4) Avoid partial intestacy 5) Favor vested remainders over contingent remainders 6) Favor alienability of property --> this is what E will want to employ 7) Read document as a whole. If we look at these rules of construction, E could argue that these rules of construction coupled w N. Suffolk's Law that states that future interests are alienable, devisable, and inheritable make a strong case for E to be able to exploit and take advantage of the economic returns of Blackacre's worth. Beacuse the courts will want to preserve the free alienability of property, then E should be able to sell Blackacre as she sits fits. Furthermore, E could couple this argument with a theory of Waste, in particular arguing that given the worth of Blackacre, if she weren't to be able to sell the property, then Blackacre would be falling prey to a Economic Waste because she wouldn't be taking advantage of Blackacre's economic worth like N. Suffolk would want her to. However, F, could counter by referencing the very same rules of construction and noting that the courts have to value the intent of the grantor: from the conveyance used, it is evident that D really really wanted to prevent the house from being sold; she wanted this so much that she took the time to emphasize it: ""I convey Blackacre to my cousing E, provided that and only so long as E does not attempt to sell the house. The house is not to be sold."" Thus, F could argue that the courts should read the grantor's intent, and should also read the document as a whole. Clearly, even if the conveyance to E was ambiguous either FSSCS or FSD, the language about the house being sold is as un-ambiguous as it gets. This is similar to the grandchildren's argument in White. Thus, E should not be permitted to solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre. Whether Fiona has any basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre and/or for holding E accountable for the repairs on Blackacre This last question brings us face to face with the ambiguity of E's conveyance: is it in FSSCS or FSD. (Similar to the Mahrenholz case. Note that that case had to do with the transferability of the accompanying future interests) offers for the sale of Blackacre. Whether Fiona has any basis for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre and/or for holding E accountable for the repairs on Blackacre This last question brings us face to face with the ambiguity of E's conveyance: is it in FSSCS or FSD. (Similar to the Mahrenholz case. Note that that case had to do with the transferability of the accompanying future interests) If the conveyance to E is FSSCS then the accompanying future interest is the ROE/POT. This means, that this accompanying future interest is an active one. Similar to the Mahrenholz case, this would require the person with the ROE or POT to physically enter the property to reclaim that interest once that condition was violated. E would want to argue this conveyance because it woiuld require F to take more action if she actually ends up violating the condition subsequent of attempting to sell the house. FSSCS would benefit E because there could very well be a scenario where E tries to sell the house and even though she has violated the condition subsequent, if the conveyance is interpreted to be FSSCS, F would literally have to travel back to N. Suffolk to Blackacre in order to reclaim the property. If the conveyance to E is FSD, this would be less favorable to E because the accompanying future interest is the Possibiltiy of Reverter, and thus, at the moment she attempted to sell Blackacre, F would have Blackacre (without having to exercise like POT/ROE). E may be in luck because according to the rules of contruction of ambigious conveyances, courts want to favor FSSCS over FSD in order to emphasize that active accompanying interest; as a result, this is what E is going to want to argue. However, the question about the repairs is a slightly different one in that it is seemingly unrelated to the breaking of the conveyance. Though F might be appalled by the state of Blacackre, given that at the moment she sees and enters Blackacre in the fact pattern, E has not yet attemped to sell Blackacre, the most F could argue to make E accountable for the repairs is that E is guilty of permissive waste. Permissive Waste is one of 4 types of waste doctrines which essentially states that a person is guilty of this if they are negligent and fail to keep/maintain the property properly. Because the fact pattern states that Eve has left and hasn't been around for several years, and because it is clear that the house has not fared well (roof shingles missing, glass cracked, other serious problems...presumably the result of negligence and problems that would not be there but for Eve actually not inhabiting in the property), F could make the argument that Eve is guilty of permissive waste and thus try to hold Eve accountable for the repairs of Blackacre. F would have a really hard time stretching that argument so that she would get ownership of Blackacre, especially since, as we noted above, Eve has yet to attempt to sell the house and break the defeasance condition. that Eve has left and hasn't been around for several years, and because it is clear that the house has not fared well (roof shingles missing, glass cracked, other serious problems...presumably the result of negligence and problems that would not be there but for Eve actually not inhabiting in the property), F could make the argument that Eve is guilty of permissive waste and thus try to hold Eve accountable for the repairs of Blackacre. F would have a really hard time stretching that argument so that she would get ownership of Blackacre, especially since, as we noted above, Eve has yet to attempt to sell the house and break the defeasance condition. However, because N. Suffolk has a pretty short period for adverse possession (10 yrs provided for the owner to bring an action to recover the title or possession of real property), I would advise Fiona to simply advise Eve that she is around and stress that she doesn't want the property sold. This would hopefully scare Eve into not selling the property, during which time F could, if she felt as strongly about Blackacre as the fact pattern states, adversely begin possessing Blackacre, especially since Eve is not around. "," Peter's situation is very similar to the situation that Echo Consulting faced when repairs of the building hindered their ability to carry out business. However, as opposed to Echo Consulting, Peter is in a potentially worse situation given that according to the fact pattern, his revenues are substantially affected. (Thus, one could make the argument that Peter is falling more into the situation that the tenant of the Reste Realty case faced. Here, under Constructive Eviction, we could advise Peter that breaking his five year lease is possible since constructive Eviction exists to help tenants who are very much in Peter's situation. The 4 elements of Constructive Eviction are: 1) That the landlord be responsible for the tenant's interference. That the interference be substantial (this means that it cannot simply be any annoyance) 3) That the landlord/lady be on notice of such interference either by the tenant (or have knowledge of it him/herself already) 4) That the tenant abandon the premises (this is required) Given the gravity of Peter's situation, it is evident that Peter can meet each of these 4 elements. 1) Linda here is responsible for the interference given that, as the fact pattern explicates, Linda was the one who decided to make some repairs to the building to begin with. 3) That the landlord/lady be on notice of such interference either by the tenant (or have knowledge of it him/herself already) 2) As the fact pattern demonstrates, the interference is pretty substantial; first of all, the construction has gone on for months as opposed to the 1 week that Linda initially told Peter. Second of all, there is a lot of construction noise (which will understandably deter customers from going to P's restaurant) and there is a lot of dust. Given that this is a restaurant, the court will probably consider this infromation in light of the potential public health hazard that opertaing a restaurant in the middle of construction poses to society. As a result, P would have a strong argument to demonstrate the substantiality of the interference. (I believe that public health hazard is P's strongest point and this would highlight the differences between his case and the Echo Consulting case which Linda is going to want to emphasize should we go to court; in Echo Consulting, there was no restaurant and no related public health hazard of any sort. Here, it seems that the court would have a stake in protecting society at large from allowing a restaurant to operate in such conditions, and it would also be unfair for P to shoulder that burden alone. Thus, P would make a strong claim that he should be allowed to break his lease and relocate somewhere else; it seems like the most straightforward solution) 3) Linda is clearly aware of the situation: not only did she order the construction herself, but P has called Linda for several months, once a week, to complain and inquire about the construction situation. Given the longevity of the situation, P would be able to demonstrate that he not only called his LL to ensure that she was aware of the situation, but that he also gave her more than reasonable time for her to respond to the situation. This would be similar to the tenant in the Reste Realty case who renewed their lease despite flooding given that their building's manager had been responsive and attentive to their flooding complaints. Here, after the building manager died and after several instances of flooding, culminating in the ""crowning blow"" flooding where the tenant was forced to leave after severe flooding of several inches, the tenant had a strong claim for Constructive Eviction and breaking the lease by abandoning the premises. I would advise P that we could reference this case 8byofdemonstrating 12 that P rented from Linda as a tenant for such a long time because she'd been a reliable landlady in the past. However, after several months of declining revenue, and continuous disruptive construction despite promises to the contrary, P could given that their building's manager had been responsive and attentive to their flooding complaints. Here, after the building manager died and after several instances of flooding, culminating in the ""crowning blow"" flooding where the tenant was forced to leave after severe flooding of several inches, the tenant had a strong claim for Constructive Eviction and breaking the lease by abandoning the premises. I would advise P that we could reference this case by demonstrating that P rented from Linda as a tenant for such a long time because she'd been a reliable landlady in the past. However, after several months of declining revenue, and continuous disruptive construction despite promises to the contrary, P could argue that he is very much in a factually similar situation as the tenant in Reste Realty since, even though Linda is sympathetic to his plight, she may as well be unresponsive given her inaction to stop the construction from continuing. 4) Though P has not done this yet, I would advise him to go through with breaking his lease. Given that P has rented from Linda since 2007, the court will gather that this is not a decision that P made on a whim; there are costs to breaking a lease and especially to breaking a lease when there is an established relationship between tenant-landlord. P could thus make the argument that the situation is just so severe, that even he, a tenant yrs, has been forced to relocate given the substantial interference. I would advise P that we could further strengthen his argument by pointing to the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, which provides a tenant with the ability to ""quietly enjoy"" the premises/space that they lease and be free from any substantial interference. The CQE covers areas such as 1) Actual/partial eviction 2) Construction eviction (covered above) 3) Damages for annoyance (which is what P was initially granted by Linda when she was willing to deduct $100 from his monthly rent for the hassle). If we apply the breach of the CQE to P's case, we find that its application fits neatly with P's situation: 1) Actual/partial eviction: Though there is no actuall complete eviction, there is partial eviction given that, as the fact pattern explicates, the construction equipment encroaches a little on his designated parking spot. This is important because the the fact pattern states that Peter is granted common use of the parking lot and one designated parking spot. Thus, this encroachment of the P's parking spot is actually partial eviction because it is not letter P have full ownership of the space. Though the argument would be unlikely to stick, (like any good lawyer, we'd want to have multiple arugments prepared) we could argue that ""partial eviction is enough to suspend rent payments of the that, as the fact pattern explicates, the construction equipment encroaches a little on his designated parking spot. This is important because the the fact pattern states that Peter is granted common use of the parking lot and one designated parking spot. Thus, this encroachment of the P's parking spot is actually partial eviction because it is not letter P have full ownership of the space. Though the argument would be unlikely to stick, (like any good lawyer, we'd want to have multiple arugments prepared) we could argue that ""partial eviction is enough to suspend rent payments of the whole"" like the rule in the wagon case where the LL encroached on the tenant's leased premises by 15in where there was wagon storage space with a wall, and the tenant suspended rent payment because they were partially evicted from the premises. Here, the court held that it was alright for the tenant to suspent rent payment because partial eviction sufficed. That is to say, the court ruled that it was unfair for the tenant to pay rent for the entirety of the premises, when he was being partially evicted from part of the premises. Thus, P could make a similar argument: it is unfair for him to be paying rent of the whole restaurant + parking spot, when he is being partially evicted from the parking spot by the construction equipment. However, L could argue that this argument is not a good one because unlike the above cited wagon case, this is the placement of construction equipment that, should P have notified L of this particular grievance, L could have taken care of it (nothing in the fact pattern states that P actually made this specific complaint about the parking spot; it simply states that he complained about the construction activity as a whole). This is different from the wagon case because that encroachment reagrded the actual building of a physical brick wall. 2) Constructive Eviction we have covered above. 3) Damages for annoyance: P could argue that even though Linda deducted $100 from his monthly rent for the hassle, that might not be enough to make up for the damages that he has suffered as a result of the construction. To further strengthen this claim for remedy damages, I would have P (or myself) calculate the loss revenue that P has incurred as a result of the construction. Futhermore, like any good (future!) lawyer, I would advise P, if he has the means, to continue depositing the rent into a separate account (not to Linda) as a back-up measure should we have to go to court. Linda's counterarguments Linda's strongest counter-arguments would be that P's case is more like the Echo Consulting case as opposed to the Reste Realty case that P would want to rely on. Here, Linda would point to how, Futhermore, like any good (future!) lawyer, I would advise P, if he has the means, to continue depositing the rent into a separate account (not to Linda) as a back-up measure should we have to go to court. Linda's counterarguments Linda's strongest counter-arguments would be that P's case is more like the Echo Consulting case as opposed to the Reste Realty case that P would want to rely on. Here, Linda would point to how, despite P's annoyance at the repairs, P is largely basing his claim off of ""damages"" that are a result of the construction's intereference with common space. Linda could argue that even though the construction interferees with the back door (which customers and the pizza restaurant use--the latter in order to make faster deliveries), the front door, which faces onto Main Street after all, has an entrance to the pizza place. Thus, Linda could argue that although the back door presents an annoyance, she should be made responsible for the pizza restaurant's staff inability to use the front door for deliveries. Furthermore, Linda could argue that it is reasonable for her (and any other LL in her situation for that matter) to believe that preserving the front door from construction (and placing the scaffolding all acorss the rear of the building) would have been sufficient. In addition, Linda could highlight the common right of access that P's lease grants him to the common spaces that are being affected by the construction. Given that the backdoor is a door to the entire building (as the fact pattern explicates), Linda could highlight that this is as common as common space would get and that P should not be able to break his lease given that this is a common space and given that she is not encroaching on any of the 2000 sq. ft. provided on his lease. In this regard, Linda could further strengthen her argument by citing to the Echo Consulting Case, where the court was reluctant to find for the tenant, Echo Consulting, after they complained of construction repairs that hindered their ability to use common spaces such as doors of common access. In this regard, Linda could argue that case law strongly supports her case. In addition, Linda could argue that she shouldn't be held responsible for being a good landlord. After all, this whole situation arises from her proactivity as a good landlord (presumably wanting to maintain the building), and that it would be unfair to punish her for being proactive and hiring a contractor to make repairs. Linda could argue that the implications of allowing P to walk away and break his lease would deter other LLs from wanting to make repairs to the property that might get them sued by tenants arguing constructive eviction. (this would be a policy argument) Furthermore, Linda could address some of the Covenant of Quient Enjoyment Factors: 1) Actual/partial eviction: as we mentioned lightly above, P never specifically complained about the the building), and that it would be unfair to punish her for being proactive and hiring a contractor to make repairs. Linda could argue that the implications of allowing P to walk away and break his lease would deter other LLs from wanting to make repairs to the property that might get them sued by tenants arguing constructive eviction. (this would be a policy argument) Furthermore, Linda could address some of the Covenant of Quient Enjoyment Factors: 1) Actual/partial eviction: as we mentioned lightly above, P never specifically complained about the partial eviction from the parking lot, so it is unreasonable for this element to have been met 2) Constructive eviction: though P has a strong argument, Linda could highlight the common usage of the common spaces, and how the rear door and parking lot are not exclusively granted to P (save for his designated parking spot) 3) Damanges: Linda could argue that it is evident that she had the intention of assuaging some of her tenant's fears when she was willing to deduct some money from P's monthly rent. Thus P could argue that this is a solution that the court should consider while preventing P from breaking his lease. A special note that the Implied Warranty of Habitability does not apply in this scenario given that this is a commercial building and tenancy. ",2470,2328
9409cf99-d224-4e45-87dd-81b81afccec7," Question 1 As a result of Dana's ambiguous conveyance, two potential sets of interests were created. One in which Eve has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS), and Dana has a right of entry/power of termination, and one in which Eve has a fee simple determinable (FSD), and Dana has a possibility of reverter. As a result of Dana's will establishing that Fiona inherited all of her personal property, Fiona has the reversion interests in this case. Due to Dana's ambiguous conveyance, in which both FSD (""so long as"") and FSSCS (""provided that"") language is used, there is some confusion as to whether Eve has a FSSCS or FSD. In cases of ambiguous conveyance, there are factors a court weighs in determining the defintiion of the conveyance. Two factors are applicable to this conveyance, them being, that FSSCS is prefered over FSD, and the other being that you should look at the intention of the conveying party. FSSCS is prefered over FSD as while FSD establishes an automatic reversion, while FSSCS leaves it to the grantor to decide if he or she would like to retake the property. This case is similar to the Tennesse dilapidated house case, in which there was also an ambiguous conveyance (White?). In that case, the court helkd that the ambiguous conveyance, created a FSD, as it was clear that the grantor wished for her house to not be sold. Given that case's precedent, and the factors a court weighs in deciphering ambiguous conveyances, a court will likely determine in thuis case, that Eve has a FSD interest. While there is a preference for FSSCS over FSD, the inclusion of ""only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house"" and ""the house is not to be sold"" establishes that Dana clearly wished for the house to not be sold, and as a result established a FSD, in which Fiona would automaticly retake the property should Eve try to sell it. Eve can make a few arguments that she should be able to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre. One of the arguments Eve can make is a result of the specific text included in the conveyance. The conveyance stated that the property was not to be sold, but did not include any language regarding soliciting offers for the sale. Based on the exact text in the conveyance, there seems to be nothing wrong with Eve seeking out offers, and listening to offers for Blackacre's sale. If the court relies on the principle of adhering to strictly the text within a conveyance, Eve should be free to solicit other offers Eve can make a few arguments that she should be able to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre. One of the arguments Eve can make is a result of the specific text included in the conveyance. The conveyance stated that the property was not to be sold, but did not include any language regarding soliciting offers for the sale. Based on the exact text in the conveyance, there seems to be nothing wrong with Eve seeking out offers, and listening to offers for Blackacre's sale. If the court relies on the principle of adhering to strictly the text within a conveyance, Eve should be free to solicit other offers for the sale of Blackacre. Should a court hold strongly that the intent of the grantor is of the upmost importance, they may rule that in addition to not being able to sell the property, Eve cannot even sollicit offers for the property. Additionally, if a court determined that Eve held a FSSCS in Blackacre, she can sollicit other offers for the property freely if Fiona agreed to not exert her right of entry or power of termination. Eve can also make an argument similar to the one used in Baker v. Weedon. In Baker v. Weedon a dispute arose between an elderly woman and her dead huisband's grandchildren. The elderly women needed money to live comfortably in her remaining years and sought to sell the land her dead husband's grandchildren ahd a future interest in. The grandchildren opposed the sale as the property was set to greatly increase in value over the next years. If Eve can make an argument that she needs the money from the house's sale, she may have a case that she should be permitted to sollicit offers for its sale. However, that argument will likely fall flat if it considering she abandoned Blackacre due to distraught from Dana's death and not because of the need for money. Additionally, another argyument she can make is that not selling the property is committing econimc waste, meaning that the property is not bein used in the bestr manner. As the real estate developer mentioend, the house is in a prime location in New Suffolk, and is worth a staggering amount. Eve can argue that it is in the best interest to sell the house for a good deal of money, and not doing so is commiting economic waste. However, Fiona can counter that argument by raising her emotional interest in the property. This would be similar to the case Ark Land, as a mining company sought to force a partiton by sale of a property it jointly owned with a family. Ark Land argued the economic necessity for selling the land, but the family won and prevented a partition by sale by arguing their emotional and family ties to the land. Economic interest, emotional interest, and family ties, are factors a court can weigh in determining what should be done with a property. If Eve argues the economic necessity for selling the property, fiona can counter by arguing her emotional ties to Blackacre and the sentimental value it holds in her heart. Additionally, if a court determines Dana's primary intent was keeping Blackacre in the family, and not necessarily having Eve own it, a court can reconcile Eve's wish to solicit offers for its sale, and Fiona's wish to move back by having Fiona purchase Blackacre from Eve. Regardless of whether a court determiend that Dana's conveyance granted Eve a FSD or FSSCS, Fiona would have a basis for reclaiming the property should Eve attempt to sell it. The only difference is done with a property. If Eve argues the economic necessity for selling the property, fiona can counter by arguing her emotional ties to Blackacre and the sentimental value it holds in her heart. Additionally, if a court determines Dana's primary intent was keeping Blackacre in the family, and not necessarily having Eve own it, a court can reconcile Eve's wish to solicit offers for its sale, and Fiona's wish to move back by having Fiona purchase Blackacre from Eve. Regardless of whether a court determiend that Dana's conveyance granted Eve a FSD or FSSCS, Fiona would have a basis for reclaiming the property should Eve attempt to sell it. The only difference is should a copurt determine that Eve has a FSD, which it likely would, Fiona would automatically retake Blackacre, as she has a possibility of reverter interest. On the other hand, if a court were to determine that Eve has a FSSCS, Fiona would have a right of entry/power of termination interest, and should Eve attempt to sell the house, Fiona would have the right to tetake Black acre should she wish. Whether Eve's interest is a FSD or FSSCS, Fiona can hold Eve accountable for the repairs needed on Blackacre, as Fiona is the future interest holder, via reversion, as Eve's interest is not fee simple absolute, or fee tail. The doctrine of waste, seeks to remedy disputes between the present interest holder and thr future interest holder, and that doctrine is applicable to this case. While Eve did not commit affirmative waste, as her actions did not directly cause the damages to the house, she did commit permissive waste, as she neglected the house when she boarded it up and moved to Florida for five years. Additionally, Eve did not improve the property in any way, and as a result did not commit ameliorative waste. As Eve does not own Blackacre in fee simple absolute, she needs to be aware and considerate of whoever holds the future interest in Blackacre, being Fiona in this case. The doctrine of waste reconciles differences betwene the present interest holder and the future interest holder and seeks to prevent the present interest holder from commiting waste that impacts the future interest holder. As a result, a court will likely find that Eve committed permissive waste by neglecting the property when she lived in Florida, and therefore a court will likely find that she is accountable for the repairs needed on Blackacre. "," Essay 2 As a result of the noise from the construction work, and the fact that Peter has to keep his windows closed because of the dust, Peter can argue that there is a breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (CQE). The CQE is applicable to both residential and commercial leases, and establishes that a tenant has the right to enjoy the lease premises under the terms they agreed upon. Peter may be able to make a case that his CQE has been breached, but Linda can counter his argument by stating that the noise and dust is only temporary, and the result of much needed repairs to the building. While Linda stated that she would deduct $100 from Peter's monthly rent as a a result of the hassle, Peter may be able to make a claim for more rent deducted based on the amount of money his business lost due to the prolonged repairs. As a result of the noise and the dust, Peter has a legal claim to arguing for a breach of the CQE. Peter will mosy likely be unable to claim that the Implied Warrant of Habitability (IWH) has been breached in his case. As a rule, the IWH typically only applies to residential leases. Further, the facts of the circumstances Peter faces will most likely not qualify as a breach of the IWH. Hilder v. St. Peter set forth the standard of what can be considered a breach of the IWH. In Hilder, a family was subject to attrocious conditions in the apartment they leased, such as collapsing ceilings, no locks, and no heat. In that case the court held that there was a breach of the IWH. However, in Peter's case, the conditions may not be ideal, but they do not prevent him or anyone else from stepping foot in the premises, and he still is able to do some business, just at a decreased capacity. Therefore, Peter's case will most likely not be considered to be a breach of the IWH. One of the legal rights Peter has is regarding the issue of construction equipment encroaching a little on Peter's designated parking space, Peter has a claim to partial actual eviction. The five-year lease Peter signed provides him with ""one designated parking spot"". As stated in McEnany v. Smith, minor encroachments on leased premises serve as a partial actual eviction, as when one leases property and pays rent for said property, they are doing so on the expectation that they will be able to enjoy all aspects of the property. In this case, the $2000 a month Peter pays in rent is paid for his right to enjoy 2000 square feet of floor area, a common use of the parking lot, and one designated parking spot. As the brick wall encroached on the tenant's leased premises in McEnany, here the construction equipment goes over the whit line into Peter's designated parking space. While Peter is still able to park in the spot, the construction equipment still prevents him from5 using the entirety of the premise. As a result, Peter has a legal claim that the enroachment of construction equipment into his parking space, which is part of the his leased premises as designated in the five-year lease he signed, prevents him from enjoying the aspects of the property. In this case, the $2000 a month Peter pays in rent is paid for his right to enjoy 2000 square feet of floor area, a common use of the parking lot, and one designated parking spot. As the brick wall encroached on the tenant's leased premises in McEnany, here the construction equipment goes over the whit line into Peter's designated parking space. While Peter is still able to park in the spot, the construction equipment still prevents him from using the entirety of the premise. As a result, Peter has a legal claim that the enroachment of construction equipment into his parking space, which is part of the his leased premises as designated in the five-year lease he signed, prevents him from enjoying the entire leased premises and therefore serves as a partial actual eviction. As a result of the partial actual eviction, Peter has a legal claim to reduced rent proportionate to the amount of the leased premises he is prevented from enjoying. However, if Peter were to feel that he has been subject to a constructive eviction, his best bet is to provide notice to Linda. Should the noise and the dust stop within a reaasonable time, Peter has no claim to constructive eviction. However, if the noise and the dust were to continue, Peter can vacate the premises, under the claim of a constructive eviction. This a risky move, but if he does so, and if a potential court were to find that there was evidence of a constructive eviction, Peter would not be liable for the remainder of the rent on the five year lease. Additionally, Peter has legal rights if he chooses to vacate the leased premises before the conclusion of his lease. If Peter were to vacate the premises, an issue would arise as to whether he abandoned or surrendered the premises. As a rule, Peter would surrender the premises if, prior to vacating the property, he and Linda came to an agreement to prematurely end their lease, or if after he vacates the property, Linda accepts his surrendering of the property. On the other hand, if he and Linda were to not come to an agreement prior to him vacating the property, or if upon his vacating of the property, Linda refused to accept his surrendering of the property, Peter's actuions would constitute as an ""abandoment"" of the property. The distinction between the two is important. If Peter surrenders the property, the lease is terminated and he is off the hook for what the remaidner of the rent would have been. On the other hand, if Peter abandons the property, he is liable for rent, until the conclusion of the original five year lease, or upon Linda finding a new tenant for the property. However, if Peter were to abandon the property, he would have some rights, because as stated in Sommer v. Kridel, landlords have a duty to mitigate damages following tenant's abandoning property. Somer v. Kridel established that upon a tenant vacating proeprty, a landlord cannot simply do nothing, and sue the tenant for the remainder of the rent. Following this case, landlords have to to take some actions to find new tenants for the abandoned premises, whether it be by placing ads in the newspaper or online, hiring a real estate agent, or by looking for new tenants themselves. This case established right's for tenants who abandon original five year lease, or upon Linda finding a new tenant for the property. However, if Peter were to abandon the property, he would have some rights, because as stated in Sommer v. Kridel, landlords have a duty to mitigate damages following tenant's abandoning property. Somer v. Kridel established that upon a tenant vacating proeprty, a landlord cannot simply do nothing, and sue the tenant for the remainder of the rent. Following this case, landlords have to to take some actions to find new tenants for the abandoned premises, whether it be by placing ads in the newspaper or online, hiring a real estate agent, or by looking for new tenants themselves. This case established right's for tenants who abandon propertym and is applicable to Peter's case should he decide to vacate the property, and should Linda refuse tp accept his surrender of the property. However, a weakness in Peter's case arises from the difficulty in accessing the rear door. While the scaffodling across the rear of the building may inconvenience, Peter, his employees, and his customers, it does not serve as an actual eviction or constructive eviction. The scaffolding does not serve as an actual eviction because everyone is still able to access the rear door, it is just more difficult now. It additionally does not serve as a constructive eviction because of the terms, ""common right of access therto,"" within the lease. Thise case is similar to Echo Consulting v. North Conway Bank. In Echo, the plaintiff raised the claim of constructive eviction as a result of being unable to use their preffered front door. In that case, the terms of Echo's lease contaiend similar language as the terms of Peter's lease in this case. In Echo, the court held that there was no constructive eviction, as ""common right of access thereto"" refers to have similar access to the building as the other tenants. In Echo's case, all the building tenants were inconvenienced regarding the inability to use the front door, just as in Peter's case, all the tenants of the building have been inconvenienced by the scaffolding across the rear of the building. As a result, the scaffolding does not serve as an actual eviction or a constructive eviction, and Peter's legal claims have a weakness in that respect. ",1458,1505
e30bf1e9-16c1-451a-91f5-6d7892477df0," Essay 1 The first issue to address is what interests were created by Dana's conveyance. In assessing the conveyance, we must look at the language used: ""I hereby convey Blackacre to my cousin, Eve, provided that and only so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house. The house is not to be sold."" The issue with this coveyance is that the language can be construed to convey to Eve either a free simple subject to condition subsequent (FSSCS) because of the conditional language used ""provided that"" OR a fee simple determinable (FSD) because of the durational language ""so long as."" When the language of a conveyance is ambiguous, we must look to the rules of construction. The rules of construction advise us to favor fee simple absolute, favor free alienability of property, favor FSSCS over FSD, favor vest remainders over contingent remainders, aim to achieve the intent of the grantor, avoid partial intestacy, and ensure consistency across the whole document. We can also look to case precedent to interpret the conveyance. Although the rule of construction favor FSSCS over FSD, the court may still convey an FSD. Like in Marhenhotlz where the coveyance of school grounds was ambiguous, the ct found the language conveyed an FSD based on the decisions of similar cases the court saw and not FSSCS in accordance with the rules of conveyance. Whether Dana conveyed Eve an FSD or FSSCS is particularly significant as that will dictate what the future interest holder has. If Eve has an FSD, then the Grantor (Dana's estate which has been conveyed to Fiona) would have possibility of a reverter. This means that if the conveyance is violated and Eve did attempt to sell the house, the property would automatically revert to Fiona (Dana'a estate). If, however, the court finds this coveyance to be an FSSCS, then Fiona (Dana'a estate) would have a future interest right of re-entry, which is not automatic and Fiona would have to take action to reclaim the property. This decision hinges on whether the ct finds the language of conveyance and the intent of the grantor was to impose a conditional limitation (FSSCS) or durational limitation (FSD) on Eve's ownership of the property. The next issue to address is whether Eve should be allowed to solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre. This of course hinges on what the court finds was conveyed to Eve, and thus if her soliciting an offer would violate the coveyance and lead to the property reverting to Fiona. Much like how the handwritten right of re-entry, which is not automatic and Fiona would have to take action to reclaim the property. This decision hinges on whether the ct finds the language of conveyance and the intent of the grantor was to impose a conditional limitation (FSSCS) or durational limitation (FSD) on Eve's ownership of the property. The next issue to address is whether Eve should be allowed to solicit offers for the sale of Blackacre. This of course hinges on what the court finds was conveyed to Eve, and thus if her soliciting an offer would violate the coveyance and lead to the property reverting to Fiona. Much like how the handwritten will in White v Brown conveyed a house to the Grantor's family member ""to live in and not to be sold,"" the will here uses the same language. The White v Brown court found the language ambiguous. The ct ultimately held that the intent of the Grantor was not clear enough, and thus granted the grantee an FSA per the statutory presumption of the state and the court's interest in promoting FSAs and the associated freedom of alienability. If a court were to follow the same logic, then they would convey an FSSCS as that is favored by the rules of construction. In that case, Fiona holds a future right to reentry and the property does NOT automatically revert to Fiona at Eve's solicitation of an offer. On the otherhand, the dissent of the White v Brown court found that the intent of the Grantor was clear with the language ""not to be sold."" A court could find that Dana's intent was clear here as well with the statement ""so long as Eve does not attempt to sell the house"" and ""the house is not to be sold."" If a court followed this line of reasoning, then the court would find that the conveyance was an FSD to Eve, and Fiona has an automatic possibility of reverter. That means that as soon as Eve solicits offers for the house, the property reverts to Fiona. It is important to note that Eve did not yet violate the terms of the conveyance, because she did not ""attempt to sell the house"" as the developer came to her. This situation changes as Eve then attempts to solicit additional offers. Eve may argue that not selling the house or soliciting offers to sell the house for more money would constitute economic waste. Much like in Baker v Weedon where the future owners wanted to sell at the time the new highway would quadruple the value of the property, Eve wants to see how much she can capitalize on the house's prime location in New Suffolk. The Baker court remanded the case, suggesting that the parties seek an equitable and fair solution, such as morgaging the house. Here, perhaps a court would suggest selling a part of the land for the economic benefit, but retaining the house to live in for sentimental purposes. She could argue that NOT selling would be economic waste, or not using the property to it's most productive extent. This is a weak argument, however, because in Arkland Co v Caudil where the coal company wanted to force sale in the intererest of preventing economic waste, the court found that economic waste is but one factor to balance against the best interest of all parties. So, the court would balance this economic value against Fiona's sentimental attachment to the house. This is likely valued very highly considering the passing of Dana and the fact that Dad lived in that houe here would suggest selling a part of the land for the economic benefit, but retaining the house to live in for sentimental purposes. She could argue that NOT selling would be economic waste, or not using the property to it's most productive extent. This is a weak argument, however, because in Arkland Co v Caudil where the coal company wanted to force sale in the intererest of preventing economic waste, the court found that economic waste is but one factor to balance against the best interest of all parties. So, the court would balance this economic value against Fiona's sentimental attachment to the house. This is likely valued very highly considering the passing of Dana and the fact that Dad lived in that houe here whole life, even after Fiona's dad died. The family lived in the house from 1980-2003 which would accrue quite a bit of emotional value. The final issue to resolve is what claims Fiona has for reclaiming ownership of Blackacre and hold Eve acountable for repairs. To do so, we need to determine what future interest is held and reconcile any conflict with the future interest. The doctrine of waste exists to reconcile present and future interests to ensure all parties receive what was conveyed to them at the time of conveyance. The court has acknowledged three types of waste (excluding the aforementioned economic waste). Permissive waste is when the present owner lacks a reasonable amount of care for the property, and such negligence deteriorates the value of the property. Affirmative waste occurs when the present owner voluntarily takes action to destroy part or all of the property and decrease its value. Ameliorative waste is when the property holder does something the increase the value of the property, thus making a change in what the future interest holder receives. Though the CL consideres ameliorative waste to be a form of waste, most jurisdictions will not find for ameliorative waste. Typically, the resolution for waste would be damages to the future interest holder, however it would be difficult to assign damages for increasing the value of someone's property. As in Wood v Woodrick where the future interest holder tried to claim damages for the current owner's removal of the barn based on the fact that the barn had monetary value, the court found that the removal of the barn actually increased the value because the barn was dilapidated so damages were not owed for the ""ameliorative waste."" In this case, Eve locks the house and moves to Florida. She take the voluntary action of leaving, so Fiona could accuse Eve of creating affirmative waste and expect damages for such deterioration of the property. Even left and when they returned to the property 5 years later, the roof shingles are missing, the glass is cracked, and there are several other problems. Most likely, a ct would find that this was due to Eve's negligence and therefore Eve owes Fiona damages for this permissive waste because Eve's negligence decreased the value of the property she has a future interest in. If a court did find that the sale of the house is in the best interest of all parties, and thus the value increases despite the condition of the house, then overall Eve would have increase the value of the property. The court would likely not consider this to be waste, and therefore no damages would be owed. returned to the property 5 years later, the roof shingles are missing, the glass is cracked, and there are several other problems.

The court would likely not consider this to be waste, and therefore no damages would be owed. If the court interprets Dana's conveyance to grant Eve an FSD, then Eve cannot solicit offers for the sale of the house, or else the property will automatically revert to Fiona. If the court interpret's Dana's conveyance to grant Eve an FSSCS, then Eve may still solicit offers and Fiona would have to be aware of this and take action to claim her right of re-entry. Either way, if a court finds that Even created waste, whether it be voluntary and thus affirmative or negligent and thus permissive, Eve would likely owe damages for the decrease in value conveyed to Fiona as a future interest holder. "," Essay 2 Peter has several options in dealing with the difficulty he is having with his rental property. Because Peter is renting for a term of years, as a tenant he is liable for rent for the entirety of that 5 year term, unless he is evicted, either constructivly by constructive eviction (CE) or actually, or there is a breach of the lease or of the covanent of quiet enjoyment (CQE). We first must address if there was a breach of the lease. In doing so, we read the lease as a contract, defining all terms by their common meaning. The lease provides Peter with ""approximately 2000 sq ft of floor area, together with common right of access thereto, a common use of the parking lot, and one designated parking spot."" Much like in Echo Co v North Conway Bank where the lease denoted common access yet construction rendered the main office door blocked, here the lease also grants Peter a ""common right of access."" Because the lease does not specify what door he and his employees/customers shall have access to, as long as he maintains access to an entrance, this term is not being violated by the landlord. Though there is not an outright breach of the lease agreement, clearly Peter is suffering an interference as he, his employees and his customers must navigate scaffolding to access the pizza shop. The Echo court held that even without breaching the lease, the landlord could still be liable for damages because the construction caused a substantial interference in the beneficial enjoyment and use of the property, constituing a breach of CQE. We next must address the issue of whether there was a breach in the CQE. The CQE dictates the that employees/customers shall have access to, as long as he maintains access to an entrance, this term is not being violated by the landlord. Though there is not an outright breach of the lease agreement, clearly Peter is suffering an interference as he, his employees and his customers must navigate scaffolding to access the pizza shop. The Echo court held that even without breaching the lease, the landlord could still be liable for damages because the construction caused a substantial interference in the beneficial enjoyment and use of the property, constituing a breach of CQE. We next must address the issue of whether there was a breach in the CQE. The CQE dictates the that landlord (or an agent of the landlord) cannot cause a substantial interfernce with the tenant's use or beneficial enjoyment of the property. As determined by Reste Realty, the CQE cannot be waived and exists in all lease agreements, so even if Peter knew the construction was happening, the LL may still be liable as ""caveat empter"" is no longer viable. If the court did find a breach in CQE, Peter could be owed damages from the landlord. In order to find a breach in CQE, Peter must prove that there was a substantial interference, the landlord cause such interference, and the landlord was notified and given reasonable time to address such interfernce. Here, Peter can claim that the landlord's construction project (clearly caused by the LL) constituted a substantial interference as he cannot open his windows because of the dust, he is losing customers, and it is more difficult to make pizza deliveries on time because of access issues. This all significant impedes his pizza business. Peter notified Linda weekly, however the construction persisted for months. A court would likely find that Peter gave notice and waited a reasonable amount of time, and thus is owed damages or is not liable for his rent. Linda may argue that given the scope of the construction, that the few months time is not reasonable. Linda may argue that this interference is not substantial due to the temporary nature of the construction project. This would not likely be a strong arguemtn, because in Reste Realty the landlord tried to claim that the flooding of the office space was not a substantial intereference due to its lack of permanance. The court held that the flooding was bound to happen every time it rained, which was substantial enough. Here, though the construction may lack permance, the impact it has on the pizza shop's business and customer base may be permanant. If customers are unable to comfortable enter the shop and delieries are coming late, Peter may permanently lose their business, which a court could find to be a substantial interference. Peter has several options for dealing with this breach of CQE. He could continue to pay rent and claim damages, he could remain and stop paying rent from the time the interference began. If he chooses this option, I would suggest he put the rent money in escrow so he can show the court that he did have an ability to pay, but withheld due to the breach of CQE. The Reste court broadened the definition of CQE. Further, he could leave and claim CE. He does not have to leave in order to recover, as the Reste court broadened the CQE, holding that a 9tenant can still recover even absent of CE, as CE is an extreme expectation to have on a tenant given the financial implications of finding a new place to rent. rent and claim damages, he could remain and stop paying rent from the time the interference began.

He does not have to leave in order to recover, as the Reste court broadened the CQE, holding that a tenant can still recover even absent of CE, as CE is an extreme expectation to have on a tenant given the financial implications of finding a new place to rent. Peter could claim CE if he does decide to leave and find a new store front. In order to claim CE, a tenant must show that the landlord's conduct substantially interfered with the use and enjoyment of the property, that the LL was notified and given reasonable time to make repairs, and that the tenant left because of the interference. Like in Reste Realty where the office flooding eventually forced the company to relocate, the construction may force the pizza shop to relocate. The LL in Reste tried to argue that there was no claim for CE because the company remained months after the flooding. Here, Peter has remained for months after the construction has gone on. Linda may try to make a similar argument, however will likely be just as unsuccessful as the LL in Reste, as the court found that the company leaving was a result of the flooding and they left once that crowning blow of their inability to host a meeting substantialling interfered. The revenues of the pizza shop being down may constitute that crowning blow. Peter may not be liable for rent if he makes a claim for partial eviction. As seen in Smith v McEnany where the landlord built a brick wall that encroached on the rented property of the tenant, the courts have held that partial eviction equates to actual eviction and dispossession of the property and as such the tenant is no longer liable for rent. The rationale here is that the rent is based on enjoyment of the entire property. Because the construction equiptment is encroaching on the parking spot Peter is promised in the lease agreement, the interference is dispossessing Peter of his property. Though he can claim partial eviction, a more practical approach would be to reassess cost and reduce based on the reduced use of property. Linda could argue that this encroachment is the reason she has deducted $100/mo from his rent. Though this is not a residential space, Peter may still attempt to claim there was a breach of the implied warranty of habitibility (IWH). The implied warranty of habitability states that the landlord must deliver a space that is clean, safe, and habitable for humans. The IWH is breached when there is a prima facea a threat to health and safety. This diverges from violation of the housing code or the interference poses the common law notion (caveat lessee) that the landlord must only deliver the property and the tenant is responsible for all other forms of maintainance. Caveat lessee was thrown away by Hilder v St Peter, $100/mo from his rent. Though this is not a residential space, Peter may still attempt to claim there was a breach of the implied warranty of habitibility (IWH). The implied warranty of habitability states that the landlord must deliver a space that is clean, safe, and habitable for humans. The IWH is breached when there is a prima facea violation of the housing code or the interference poses a threat to health and safety. This diverges from the common law notion (caveat lessee) that the landlord must only deliver the property and the tenant is responsible for all other forms of maintainance. Caveat lessee was thrown away by Hilder v St Peter, where the slumlord rented the tenant an apartment that was is terrible, unsanitary and unsafe conditions. The court reasoned that the modern tenant expects the LL to address issues as they have more knowledge of the property and superior resources. The court has an interest in protecting the tenant, who has less bargaining power. Though the IWH typically only extends to residential rentals, Peter could argue that the construction poses a health and safety risk. The scaffolding blocks access to the rear door-- of a kitchen! What would Peter of his staff and customers do if there was a fire? This blocking of the entry may violated the restaraunt building codes. Further, Peter can't open windows to ventilate which poses additional health and safety concerns. If he did, dust would enter and compromise the food he prepares, another health risk to many. Peter states it is nearly impossible to bring a car to the rear door, his only entry/exit currently, so it would be nearly impossible for an emergency vehicle to help someone inside. Due to these violations, Peter may have a claim to a breach in the IWH which would end his liability to pay rent. Linda will argue this does not apply in a non-residential space, but a court may be persuaded by the significance of the risks to health and safety. If there is a breach in the IWH, Peter has the same options to continue to pay rent and claim damages, he could remain and stop paying rent from the time the interference began. If he chooses this option, I would suggest he put the rent money in escrow so he can show the court that he did have an ability to pay, but withheld due to the breach. He would also have the option to pay for repair on his own and deduct the cost from his rent, but nothing he could really do to repair this interference. Perhaps he could hire additional workers to speed up the construction and deduct this cost from his rent. If Peter decides to stay and withhold rent, he should not fear that his LL will evict him on her own accord via means of self help. Though the common law permits LL self-help to reentry if there is (1) a tenant breach and (2) re-entry is peaceable, the Berg v Wiley court found that self help is never peaceable and thereby not permitted. In that case, the tenant breached the lease by renovating, and the LL attempted to reenter to stop damages. The tenant called the police to prevent the LL from entering. these days, the LL would have to evict the tenant The court found that the judicial process is so speedy throught the legal system. So, if Linda wanted to evict Peter if he were to stop paying rent, she would have to do so through the legal system, as the court has an interest in preventing the potential violence accord via means of self help. Though the common law permits LL self-help to reentry if there is (1) a tenant breach and (2) re-entry is peaceable, the Berg v Wiley court found that self help is never peaceable and thereby not permitted.

So, if Linda wanted to evict Peter if he were to stop paying rent, she would have to do so through the legal system, as the court has an interest in preventing the potential violence with self-help remedies. Peter should note that if he were to be evicted through the legal system, he would then have a record of the eviction and may struggle to find his next rental space. Linda would probably put the costs of that process onto her next tenant, so that has implications for the whole system. If Peter withheld rent and Linda wanted to sue for the lost rent payments, she would have a duty to mitigate the damages before claiming they are owed to her by Peter. As determined by Sommver v Kridel, where the tenant had to break the lease bfore moving in because his marriage fell through and he couldn't afford it, if the LL has the option for another suitable tenant to move in and pay rent, they must pursue that to mitigate the lost rent costs. Linda would have to show the court that she took all the reasonable measures to secure a new tenant, holding the burden of proof. This is unlike the usual contracts approach fro burden of proof, but simply makes sense because Linda would have access to the evidence of her attempt to mitigate. Of course, Peter could rebut any evidence she produced. Peter is liable for rent until the end of the term of years, however this liability would likely fall away because he has valid claims for a breach of the convanant of quiet enjoyment by the construction interfering with his beneficial use of the property, a potential claim for partial eviction, and a potential claim for breach of the implied warranty of habitability.

Eve will have hold of Blackacre until she attempts to sell the house. Upon selling the house, Dana would have the right to re-enter and claim possession in FSA, leaving Eve with nothing. However, it could be argued that Eve had a Fee Simple Determinable (FSD) and Dana have a Possibility of Reverter (POR) based on durational language being used. But, the conveyance is rather ambiguous as both durational and conditional language is used and the Rules of Construction would lean towards favoring a FSSCS over a FSD. On the contrary, the case involving whether or not storage still constituted a ""school purpose"", the court held such language as being more like an FSD. The ""school purpose"" clause construed a limitation, which points to a FSD. Eve would have Blackacre until she attempts to sell. Such interpretation would point out a durational and limitation aspect in the conveyance, compared to a conditional aspect as needed for a FSSCS. Upon the death of Dana, Fiona then gets passed down Dana's interest in Blackacre and holds a right of entry in FSA. Strictly looking at the conveyance, Fiona would have the right to re-enter Blackacre if Eve decided to make an attempt to sell. When it was discovered that Eve was willing to hear offers to sell Blackacre, Fiona would have the right to re-enter and take ahold of Blackacre in FSA. However, there could be trouble in her case considering Eve never put forth an attempt to sell, but rather was given an offer. A court could read the clear language of the conveyance and could reasonable infer that Eve never made a substantial step in selling Blackacre. In such a case, Fiona would not have the right to re-enter and assert her claim of Blackacre. By taking offers on Blackacre, Eve is not attempting to sell and therefore not creating a breach on the conveyance. Hearing offers would not be convincing enough for a court to rule it as an ""attempt"". The conveyance is slightly ambiguous in that aspect and the there could be trouble in her case considering Eve never put forth an attempt to sell, but rather was given an offer.

In such a case, Fiona would not have the right to re-enter and assert her claim of Blackacre. By taking offers on Blackacre, Eve is not attempting to sell and therefore not creating a breach on the conveyance. Hearing offers would not be convincing enough for a court to rule it as an ""attempt"". The conveyance is slightly ambiguous in that aspect and the meaning of ""attempt"" that Dana was intending. Eve could also argue that if it was shown that her accepting offers was an ""attempt"" to sell that she had done so because she was under the impression that Fiona had no interest in Blackacre, which is why Eve was in the conveyance in the first place and not Fiona. Fiona would also be able to hold Eve accountable for the poor conditions of Blackacre and re-enter the property because of waste. Eve committed affirmative, permissive, and ameliorative waste. She committed affirmative waste by purposefully leaving Blackacre knowing that herself and no-one was staying behind to maintain the land, leading to a deteriorating roof and cracked windows. She committed permissive waste by purposefully neglecting Blackacre by laving it locked and moving to Florida, leaving Blackacre subject to the cold, harsh weather in New Suffolk. Lastly, she committed ameliorative waste because the lack of care actually led to an increase in value for the property. However, a more modern doctrine approach has deemed that an increase in value is actually not waste at all. The United States has started to move away from the idea that an increase in value is waste. Such was seen in the Red Barn case where it was held the destruction of the barn was not waste because it actually increased the property of the land. If found that Eve could sell the property, it would go under the partition steps. It is presumed that a partition of kind is favored over a partition by sale through Common Law. While value is there for Blackacre, Fiona claims to have sentimental interests in the property and that must also be considered. While only a handful of states have adopted the Uniform Act, it would most likely be used by a court for this case. The act would allow Eve to sell the property to Fiona for a set price that is determined from an appraisal of the property. If Fiona elects to reject the offer to purchase, then Eve would be allowed to auction off her interest in Blackacre to a third party. "," In order for Peter, the tenant, to not be liable for any of his further rent he needs to show that Linda, the landlord, breached her obligation of an Implied Warranty of Habitability (IWH) or the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (CQE). Considering this case is only set in a commercial setting, the IWH would not apply as that deals solely with a residential setting. That leaves the argument of whether Linda violated her obligation of the CQE. A breach of CQE can result in actual/partial eviction, constructive eviction (CE), or damages (at least). A court would likely rule that there was an actual/partial eviction based on the fact that Peter's parking space was encroached on by the equipment. Part of his lease determined that Peter would be awarded a designated parking space. As seen in the brick wall case, the landlord built a brick wall that encroached on the land that was being leased out by a tenant and ruled that that was an actual/partial eviction. This case is no different in how Peter's parking space (leased land) was encroached on by the construction equipment (brick wall). This would leave Peter the ability to withhold all further rent. However, a court would likely rationalize that Peter's rent be deducted based on the degree of encroachment. Being it was a mere encroachment, Linda's act to deduct $100 from the rent would be reasonable and a court would agree. The rent of $1,900 for that given month would be solved. The remainder of rent for the overall lease would not be in question. While actual/partial eviction can be seen here, CE cannot. CE is met when there is a substantial interference from the landlord towards the tenant, when the tenant gives notice and a reasonable amount of time for the landlord to resolve any issues, and when the tenant abandons the property. Peter was substantially interfered by the construction due to his access being restricted, customers loosing track on how to enter his business, and trouble keeping pizzas warm and sent out quick with the construction distruppting Peter's ability to park a car right outside the back door. However, Echo showed how the language of the conveyance listing a ""common access"" is not implying front door access. The court held that other access points are available and therefore there is not a breach, even though such access might be annoying. Peter may be annoyed that it is a maze-like path to get through the scaffolding but substantially interfered by the construction due to his access being restricted, customers loosing track on how to enter his business, and trouble keeping pizzas warm and sent out quick with the construction distruppting Peter's ability to park a car right outside the back door. However, Echo showed how the language of the conveyance listing a ""common access"" is not implying front door access. The court held that other access points are available and therefore there is not a breach, even though such access might be annoying. Peter may be annoyed that it is a maze-like path to get through the scaffolding but such an annoyance is not enough to bring forth a claim of CE. Echo also raised the point of how such contruction was only a temporary interference and could not be seen as being substantial as a result. Such a court would rule that the construciton done by Linda was only a temporary occurrence and not an everlasting one. However, Peter could argue that he was assured it would be done in a reasonable time of a week and it turned into a multi-month project. Peter prepared only for loosing a week of business, not several months. Peter gave Linda notice of the issues that arose from the construction around the building. Linda assured him that the construction would only last a little longer. Peter continued to raise the issues with Linda and Linda continued to say the construction was almost done. No definative time was given for when the construction would be complete. Peter gave Linda a reasonable amount of time to fix the issues and Linda failed to do so. Peter would be able to stop paying rent untl the issues were resolved. Although that is a reasonable conclusion, Peter could not bring a claim of CE because he failed the last requirement of abandoning the property. If Peter had abandoned the property, he could successfully assert a claim of CE considering he gave notice and has a reasonable argument that the construction was actually a substantial interference to his business. In conclusion, Peter was not CE but he was actually/partially evicted and could be awarded damages as a result. Such an eviction constitutes a breach of CQE by Linda. Part of his leased space was encroached upon. To resolve the issue, Linda deducted $100 from his overall monlthy rent and the court would agree, following the rationale that stemmed from the brick wall case. Following that issue, Peter's business was substantially altertered due to the construction. He gave notice to Linda and after an unreasonable amount of time the issues were still present. In Reste Realty it was shown how there was a ""crowning blow"" which led to the abandonment of the property (severe flooding). Here, Peter's crowning blow was the continued distrubance by the construction and the negative impact it had on his business. While he never abandoned quite yet, the crowning blow led to his desire to move locations. Peter would be able to leave the property and find a new place to lease without having to fulfill the remaining payments owed to Linda. Linda would suffer the loss as she breached her landlord obligation by violating the CQE of the lease she held with Peter. an unreasonable amount of time the issues were still present.
