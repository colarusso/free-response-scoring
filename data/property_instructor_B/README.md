This folder contains:
- the text of two _Property_ final exam questions (`property_instructor_B.docx`)
- a set of student answers to these questions (`texts_redacted.csv`), along with unique exam IDs and word counts for each answer
- the scores for each exam, along with their unique exam IDs (`actual_redacted.csv `)

Notes: After human review for inadvertent PII disclosure, it's seems the preprocessing step produced some duplicate strings (e.g., sentences) within student answers. This doesn't appear to have effected the information content of the answers aside from repeating some points and when measured against the entirety of answers constituted only a small fraction of the text.
