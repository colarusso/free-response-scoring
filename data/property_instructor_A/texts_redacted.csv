b54398fb-14ce-4ad0-9a86-9813160d627f," As written the grant gives the following present and future interests: Oliver has a fee simple subject to executory limitation. Carla, Connor, and Oliver's potential other children who have not yet been born at the time of the grant have a(n) (shifting) executory interest in fee simple as well. Robert has an indefeasibly vested remainder in a life estate. Victor, the grandchild of Oliver who has reached the age requirement set forth in the grant has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple. Vivian, the other grandchild who has not yet reached the age requirement of the grant, has an executory interest in fee simple. Other grandchildren not-yet ascertained at the time of the grant have an executory interest Going into depth as to why each of these interests was created and how the Rule against Perpetuities applies to them creates an in depth discussion that I will break down in detail. The language of the grant conveys the property to the first of his children to retire. As both of the children are still working full time, the conveyance has not yet occurred. The present interest created when a grantee can cut short the grantor's present interest is a fee simple subject to executory limitation. The future interest created in this case is an executory interest which either Carla or Connor can have. While the person who will cut short the present interest is not technically known yet, their future interest cannot be a contingent remainder as contingent remainders cannot cut short possessory estates and can only follow the natural end of a possessory estate after the death of the previous interest holder. Carla and Connor's interest is in the quantum of a life estate because the language of the grant clearly stipulates that they will receive the property ""for life."" In instances where an explicit phrase such as ""for life"" has been used and there is no ambiguous meaning looking to the grant as a whole, the court will determine that this is a life estate granted to them. Executory interests are subject to the Rule against Perpetuities (""RAP"" for the remainder of the exam) along with both contingent remainders and vested remainders subject to open. As Carla and Connor have an executory interest we must ask whether their interest will either necessarilly vest or fail within a life in being plus 21 years of the time of the grant. As they are both alive at the time of the grant and we will know for a fact whether or not they retire within their own lives, Carla property ""for life."" In instances where an explicit phrase such as ""for life"" has been used and there is no ambiguous meaning looking to the grant as a whole, the court will determine that this is a life estate granted to them. Executory interests are subject to the Rule against Perpetuities (""RAP"" for the remainder of the exam) along with both contingent remainders and vested remainders subject to open. As Carla and Connor have an executory interest we must ask whether their interest will either necessarilly vest or fail within a life in being plus 21 years of the time of the grant. As they are both alive at the time of the grant and we will know for a fact whether or not they retire within their own lives, Carla and Connor are their own validating lives in this instance. If the language had called out just those two, their executory interest would be valid under the RAP. Oliver's other children that are not yet born also have an executory interest, but their interest is invalid under the RAP which causes the entire line to be struck from the grant. Say, for instance, the day after the grant has been made Oliver has another child and then the day after that child is bor, everyone alive at the time of the grant dies. That child may not retire for 70 years which exceeds the life in being plus 21 years of a validating life at the time of the grant. Robert then has an indefeasibily vested interest in a life estate as the language of the grant, again, clearly creates a life estate for Robert and there are no conditions that may divest the life estate either before he takes possession of the property or after he has taken possession other than his own natural death. As this is not an executory interest, contingent remainder, nor a vested remainder subject to open, the RAP does not apply to Robert's interest and it is valid at the grant. Victor, the eldest grandchild of Oliver has already satisfied the age requirement of the grant and therefore his interest has vested. Where it is possible that other grandchildren are born and reach the age requirement of the grant, though, Victor's interest is subject to partial divestment or subject to open. Vivian has the ability to cut short or take away part of Victor's vested interest, so though she has not reached the precedent conditional age to take an interest in the property, she cannot have a contingent remainder and must have an executory interest as she is a grantee. Victor and Vivian's interests are both subject to the RAP and typically their interests would violate the RAP. There is a world where the day after the grant Oliver has another 3 children and then the rest of the folks alive at the time of the grant die. Those 3 children go on to wait 40 years before they have kids and then those kids do not turn 25 for a total of 65 years after the death of all of the validating lives in being at the time of the grant which means the class would not necessarily close within a life in being plus 21 years of the grant. If we were to apply the Rule of Convenience, however, victor and Vivian's interest would be valid. Essentially, the Rule of Convenience (""RAC"" for the rest of the exam), allows us to rewrite the grant, as long as at least one person has satisfied the condition stipulated in the grant, to include only those currently alive. Therefore, applying it and striking from the grant the piece discussed previously that violated the RAP, the grant would read instead: after the death of all of the validating lives in being at the time of the grant which means the class would not necessarily close within a life in being plus 21 years of the grant. If we were to apply the Rule of Convenience, however, victor and Vivian's interest would be valid. Essentially, the Rule of Convenience (""RAC"" for the rest of the exam), allows us to rewrite the grant, as long as at least one person has satisfied the condition stipulated in the grant, to include only those currently alive. Therefore, applying it and striking from the grant the piece discussed previously that violated the RAP, the grant would read instead: ""To my nephew Robert for life, then to my grandchildren currently living who reach the age of 25."" "," 1A. A Conversation with Brock Hi Brock, thank you for coming by the office today, I'm happy to take a few moments to work with you and figure out exactly what is going on here. To start, we need to examine what exactly the property interest that you have in the land is. That is to say, we must determine if you have a tenancy in common with your brother Alex, or whether you have a joint tenancy, as that will effect what steps we might need to take to ""make some money from the developer"" as you put it. Tenancy in Common is the default form of co-tenancy that courts recognize. It is characterized by a separate, fractional interest in the property with a universal right to use the entirety of the property. If there is any ambiguity in the conveyance, then courts will hold you and your brother as tenants in common. Joint tenancy on the other hand is a bit more specialized and harder to establish. A Joint tenancy is characterized by an undivided interest between all parties to the joint tenancy with a universal right to use the entirety of the property. The thing that makes a Joint Tenancy especially unique, though, is the right of survivorship that accompanies it. The right of survivorship in a joint tenancy makes it so that when one of the joint tenants dies, all of the interest that the now-deceased party had automatically goes to their joint tenant, avoiding probate entirely. In other words, if you had a will that passed along all of your property interests to your heirs, if you died while in a joint tenancy, those heirs would receive no interest in the property you held in a joint tenancy. A joint tenancy is created and can only be sustained so long as the four unities of time, title, interest, and possession are held in tact. Time, refers to the fact that all parties to the joint tenancy must have received the property interest at the same time. The unity of title stipulates that the same document needs to create the joint tenancy, there cannot be two documents. goes to their joint tenant, avoiding probate entirely.

Time, refers to the fact that all parties to the joint tenancy must have received the property interest at the same time. The unity of title stipulates that the same document needs to create the joint tenancy, there cannot be two documents. Interest refers to the need for all partiesto the joint tenancy to have equal property interests in the property, and finally possession speaks to the ability of all parties to the joint tenancy's ability to use te entirety of the property. Creating a joint tenancy is also very difficult. The language needs to be precise. A majority of courts hold that if one piece of language is missing, then the grant that creates the co- tenancy is actually creating a Tenancy in Common. As such, modern courts often require language such as ""to a and b as joint tenants, not as tenants in common, with right of survivorship."" This is the most iron-clad example. Other minority courts, like MA courts however, hold that ""to a and b jointly"" is enough to establish a joint tenancy. With that rule in mind let's talk about your specific situation In this instance, it appears that Alex acquired the property before you as evidenced when you informed me that Alex purchased the property in 2000 and invited you to join him in the business and land in 2003. At the time that you paid him for your interest, though, Alex created a new deed that granted the land to himself and to you, Brock, jointly as tenants in common."" Applying the lense of the joint tenancy for a moment, this conveyance would be enough to satisfy the four unities of time (both of you received your interest simultaenously), title (one deed gave both of you your property interests), interest (the conveyance did not call out that either of you had unequel or separate fractional shares) and possession (the grant said nothing about your ability to use or not use the entirety of the land. Where the unities of a joint tenancy were created, we need now look at the language used, ""to hold jointly as tenants in common."" From that language, it is not abundantly clear that a joint tenancy was created. In fact, the language explicitly creates a tenancy in common. Therefore, you and your brother are likely tenants in common, each with a 1/2 interest in the property. Next, we need to talk about what your rights to sell your interest is and how you might be able to split up the land should you choose. There are three options open to you. You can unilaterally sell your 1/2 property interest to the developing company, or you can ask for a partition in kind, or move for a partition by sale. As a tenant in common, you have the ability to unilaterally alienate (sell/transfer) your interest to another party. We should also speak more in depth about partitions. Courts have held that a partition in kind wherein property is distributed to each of the tenants in common according to their fractional property Next, we need to talk about what your rights to sell your interest is and how you might be able to split up the land should you choose. There are three options open to you. You can unilaterally sell your 1/2 property interest to the developing company, or you can ask for a partition in kind, or move for a partition by sale. As a tenant in common, you have the ability to unilaterally alienate (sell/transfer) your interest to another party. We should also speak more in depth about partitions. Courts have held that a partition in kind wherein property is distributed to each of the tenants in common according to their fractional property interest is the default version of a partition action. A partition by sale, on the other hand has to be specifically requested by one of the tenants in common and, along with moving for the partition by sale, they must prove that a partition in kind is impracticable due to the geographical qualities of the land itself and that a partition by sale would better suit the interests of all parties. For a partition by sale, the profits from the sale are then split up according to the fractional property interests. The word ""interests"", in the context of a partition by sale, does not refer only to financial interests, either. Sure financial interests are accounted for, but there are also personality interests to take into account. A personality interest refers to a sentimental connection with the property that one of the parties might have. The reason that courts apply partition in kind by default is to stop one tenant in common from essentially forcing a sale of the land. There are also situations where Here, you could unilaterally sell your 1/2 share to the property development company no problem. Additionally, you could move for a partition of the property in kind. A partition in kind in this instance is most likely to be met wth little oppossition from the court as there do not appear to be any geographically unique aspects of the property that would not allow a court to equitably split the property. In theory, the piece of the land with the brewery, restaurant, and tasting room may be worth more than the undeveloped space of the rest of the 10 acres. In that instance, a court may split up the property equally and require one of you, Brock or your brother Alex, to make an Owelty payment to the other so that the value of the land that you receive is equal to what you are receiveing in total compensation from the other. I foresee some trouble in trying to create a partition by sale. As I stated, there does not appear to be any geographically restrictive qualities to the property that would make the partition in kind impracticable. Say that there was, though, you will likely not be able to prove that a partition by sale best serves the interest of all parties. Although Alex paid only 500k for the property back in 2000 and the property is worth 2 million currently, Alex has a personality interest in holding onto his piece of the property. It was his dream to make beer and he is succeeding in that regard. Applying the two-part conjunctive test, you will likely not be 13 to have a partition by sale. able You may also have the ability to request some contribution charges from your brother Alex as he partition in kind impracticable.

It was his dream to make beer and he is succeeding in that regard. Applying the two-part conjunctive test, you will likely not be able to have a partition by sale. You may also have the ability to request some contribution charges from your brother Alex as he ousted you from your property. Ouster occurs when one of the tenants in common either physically or manifestly in words or writing completely excludes another tenant in common from entering the property. It is not enough that you not be able to use some of the land as the other tenat in common is using it, but rather, it needs to be full exclusion in the manner described. In those instances, the party that was ousted can request a contribution action and recover rent for the property up to the market value that the land would garner should the tenant in common not be using it. If the possessing party is paying other carrying costs, though, they can offset the rent that they might owe for the ouster with those costs in an accounting motion. In this instance there was an ouster when Alex told you to ""get out of her and don't come back."" This intent to ouster you is clearly manifested in words and/or writing satisyfing the ouster condition. You may be able to recover market-value rent from your brother given that you had paid your half of carrying charges like taxes and repairs previously and currently. Thanks for coming by, let me know if you have any further questions. B. A Conversation with Carl Hi Carl, thank you for coming by let's have a chat about your situation. In regards to the gold coins, the issue here is what kind of property those gold coins are going to be classified as- lost, mislaid, abandoned, embedded, or treasure trove. All of these types of property have different implications as to who gets to keep the coins. With lost property classified in a very colloquial way wherein property must be in a place the owner did not intend to put it, finders have the best right to the property against all but the original owner. For mislaid property which is classified as property that was intentionally placed somewhere but then forgotten, the person who's property the mislaid item is on has the best right to all else but the original owner. This is so that if a person is tracing back their steps, they are able to find the property easily. Embedded property exists when an item becomes part of the property that it is on itself and the best right as to all else but the original owner. Treasure trove is not typically recognized in American courts as it went7 into the British C.L. after the American Revolution, but the best right goes to the person that finds it. Finally, the person who finds abandoned property has the best righ to it over all else, even the original owner. In this situation, the property you found was was intentionally placed somewhere but then forgotten, the person who's property the mislaid item is on has the best right to all else but the original owner. This is so that if a person is tracing back their steps, they are able to find the property easily. Embedded property exists when an item becomes part of the property that it is on itself and the best right as to all else but the original owner. Treasure trove is not typically recognized in American courts as it went into the British C.L. after the American Revolution, but the best right goes to the person that finds it. Finally, the person who finds abandoned property has the best righ to it over all else, even the original owner. In this situation, the property you found was likely either mislaid and then deemed abandoned, or embedded. (Armory v. Delamory) The bag of gold coins could be established as mislaid and then abandoned. It is unlikely that a person could lose a bag of this nature into a small crevice in the base of the foundation of a warehouse, making the qualification of ""lost"" unlikely. In order for a bag to get into a space where you yourself had to get down on your hands and knees, and squeeze your fingers through a small hole, it seems to reason that someone would have likely also needed to put that same amount of effort in to get the bag into the space. The bag also had the name of a supermarket that opened 10 years ago on it. As such, if the bag had been in this space for as long as the store was open for, 10 years, with no one having come back for it, this property could be seen as abandoned. On the other hand, it could be embedded property. Another scenario exists as to how the bag got into the warehouse foundation base, though I believe the courts would find this less compelling. In the construction of warehouse when the crew was digging out and displacing dirt, the bag could have been placed into it. Where it is behhind a wall, a court might hold that this bag has become embedded into the warehouse itself. Given that the warehouse was an ""old warehouse"" when the current owner bought it in 2000, though, I believe the more likely scenario is the aforementioned where it was mislaid into this space and then abandoned which would give you, Carl, the best right to it against all in the whole world. The growler that you gave to the brewery constituted an express bailment agreement. In an express bailment agreement you become the bailor and the person you gave the item to becomes the bailee. An express bailment is created when the bailor deposits intentionally, an item with another party and is given specific receipt of the deposit with the receipt being the means of retrieving the bailed item. In this case, you gave the growler to the bartender and he handed you back a claim ticket with a number on it. He subsequently attached a tag with the same number to your growler clearly marking that as yours. As such, a court, would likely hold this as a bailment relationship as it pertains to your growler and you would be able to recover from the brewery for the value of the growler itself.

As such, a court, would likely hold this as a bailment relationship as it pertains to your growler and you would be able to recover from the brewery for the value of the growler itself. We also need to look to see if you had an implied bailment agreement for your jacket. (Hyatt) In an implied bailment, though there is no specific ticket tied to a specific item, a reasonable degree of care requirement is established for your item from the attending circumstances of the way in which the item was stored. In Hyatt, for example, a car was parked inside a lot with an attendant, a security team making sweeps of the garage, only one exit, and the need to pay a parking fee at the aforementioned exit, which was also gated. In this instance, the coat that you left on the rack by the door was not monitored. Per fire codes, there was likely more than one exit in and out, and you did not need to pay to remove a coat from the rack. For all of these differences, even the majority court in Hyatt would likely find that you did not have a bailment agreement for your coat. C. Hi Alex, thanks for coming, let's talk about each of your grants separately and examine what the interests were at the time of the grant and what the current interests are now. David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation, frank and fred have an executory interest in fee simple. Frank and Fred's interest are subject to the RAP as they are executory interests. This portion of the grant violates the RAP because David, and his heirs which is implied in modern jurisdictions, could use the land for residential purposes for 200+ years after the death of all of the persons alive at the time of the grant. As such, the grant would need to be rewritten as just ""To David."" The rewriting of the grant establishes David as having a fee simple absolute and allows David to continue to use the land as he pleases for whatever purpose he wants without deadhand control. Therefore, neither Frank nor Fred are going to be able to take the land that you had granted to David. Edward has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, Alex has a right of re-entry in fee simple. The language that you used ""so long as"" when creating the grant, are words of duration which is indicative of a present interest known as a fee simple determinable with your future interest being a possibility of reverter. When we look at the grant as a whole, though, you ended the grant with the fact that you have the right to re-enter and reclaim the premises. This language is typically indicative of a future interest he pleases for whatever purpose he wants without deadhand control. Therefore, neither Frank nor Fred are going to be able to take the land that you had granted to David. Edward has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, Alex has a right of re-entry in fee simple. The language that you used ""so long as"" when creating the grant, are words of duration which is indicative of a present interest known as a fee simple determinable with your future interest being a possibility of reverter. When we look at the grant as a whole, though, you ended the grant with the fact that you have the right to re-enter and reclaim the premises. This language is typically indicative of a future interest known as a right of re-entry and a present interest known as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. When there is ambiguity, the court will look towards the rules of construction to parse the grant. The rules of construction hold that courts prefer a fee simple subject to condition subsequent with a right of re-entry future interest because a right of re-entry is not an automatically applying interest like the possibility of reverter is. Neither of these future interests are subject to the RAP, though, and therefore, we do not need to examine whether your grant language violates it. All things considered, the courts will most likely interpret the language you used to have created a fee simple subject to condition subsequent present interest and a right of re-entry in fee simple as a future interest. As such, in order to exercize your right, you will need to bring a claim against Edward to remove him from the propert before he is able to satisfy the elements of adverse possession which would see him take the interest from you. "," A. Debbie and Betty Debbie will likely bring a claim of adverse possession against Betty in a Quiet Title action should there be any legal conflict over Greenacre. In order to satisfy adverse possession and take the land, one must meet 5 essential elements of possession: the possession must be open and notorious, the possession must be hostile, the possession must be actual, the possesion must be continous for the statutory period, and the possession must be exclusive. As demonstrated in the Marengo Cave case, open and notorious possession is possession to an extent that would put the actual owner of the land on actual or constructive notice that someone else has taken possession. Hostility must be examined through one of three standards, the good faith standard set up in the Tieu case, the bad faith standard of the state of Maine, or the objective standard set forth in Cahill. The good faith standard requires that for a person to demonstrate the hostility element of adverse possession (AP henceforth) the AP'er must enter unaware that the land belongs to someone else. They must, in other word, have good faith and believe the land is theirs. In a bad faith exclusive. As demonstrated in the Marengo Cave case, open and notorious possession is possession to an extent that would put the actual owner of the land on actual or constructive notice that someone else has taken possession. Hostility must be examined through one of three standards, the good faith standard set up in the Tieu case, the bad faith standard of the state of Maine, or the objective standard set forth in Cahill. The good faith standard requires that for a person to demonstrate the hostility element of adverse possession (AP henceforth) the AP'er must enter unaware that the land belongs to someone else. They must, in other word, have good faith and believe the land is theirs. In a bad faith jurisdiction, the AP'er must enter with the conscious desire to take the land of another- they must know the land is not theirs and enter anyways with the desire to take the land. Finally, the majority of jurisdictions are objective standard jurisidcitions which examine the acts of th AP'er to see if they believed they had the best title to the land regardless of what their belief was when they entered. Actual possession is characterized as using the land in a way in which the person who rightfully owned the land otherwise would. Continuous for the statutory period states that a person must possess the land for the required amount of time under the statute, but they may tack with privity the possession of any previous Adverse posssessor to their time of possession (eg. x possesses for 2 years, y for 3 right after and the land was transferred willingly and voluntarily, makes y=5 years of possession.) Finally, the last element of AP, exclusive, requires that a person not share the land with the public or the rightful owner of the land but for the AP'er granting their permission for the public or rightful owner to use the land. Color of title is also relevant in this situation. Under color of title, if a possessor is able to show the elements of Adverse Possession for the statutory period and they acquired the land through a defective title, then they get constructive ownership of the entirety of the property outlined in the defective title and as long as the rightful owner of the property is not present on the property, then the AP claim will see the person possessing under Color of Title receive the entirety of the property. Debbie must prove that she satisfied all of these elements. Let's examine them more in depth. 1. Open and notorious Debbie will argue that she possessed the land in such a manner that Betty was on actual or constructive notice when she cleared out the acreage for the formal garden and when she placed built the year-round home on the property. Betty will argue that she had no way of knowing that Debbie was on her property as she had never been to the area. The court will likely rule in favor of Debbie. AP exists in part to keep sleepy owners from exercising control on land that they do not use. The folks of the area knew that Debbie was on this land (more on this later). This would be enough that the actual owner be put on constructive notice. 2. Hostile notice when she cleared out the acreage for the formal garden and when she placed built the year-round home on the property. Betty will argue that she had no way of knowing that Debbie was on her property as she had never been to the area. The court will likely rule in favor of Debbie. AP exists in part to keep sleepy owners from exercising control on land that they do not use. The folks of the area knew that Debbie was on this land (more on this later). This would be enough that the actual owner be put on constructive notice. 2. Hostile Debbie will argue that under the good faith jurisdiction and objective standard jurisdiction that she satisfied the AP element of hostility. She entered in good faith under color of title (more on this later as well) believing that the deed given to her in her father Chris's will was valid. Additionally, under the objective standard, unlike in Cahill, Debbie never sought permission from anyone before making changes to the property and did not inquire about the purchase of theproperty from anyone indicating that she believed someone had better title to the land than she. Betty would win in a bad faith jurisidiction on this element, though, as Debbie impliedly had no reason to suspect that the land was not hers and therefore did not enter with the conscious desire to take the land from someone else. 3. Actual Debbie will argue that she used the land in a way an actual landowner would use it. She improved the property by clearing out a section and maintaining a ""lovely"" garden and built a house on the land that could be inhabited year-round. Betty, though, will argue that the land was hunting ground and fishing areas and that any usage of the land for any reason outside of this would not be in the way an actual landowner would use it. Debbie has a better argument here as the court would likely see the public good that Debbie has brought to the area in terms of improving the property and not want to set the precedent that Debbie or any AP'er for that matter, only be able to use land in a way that the previous owner was using it. Betty will also argue that Debbie only uses one small tract of land so that, even if she does satisfy all AP elements, she is only entitled to the 2 acres while Betty should have the rest. Debbie entered under color of title though. Chris received a defective document from Andrew that he, in good faith, thought was sufficient. As such, when Debbie received the defective title from her father Chris, she entered the land under color of title. Though she only used the small two-acre piece of land, she had constructive use of the entirety of the property since Betty was not on the property in any capacity. Therefore, Debbie stands to take the whole of Greenacre. 4. Continous entered under color of title though. Chris received a defective document from Andrew that he, in good faith, thought was sufficient. As such, when Debbie received the defective title from her father Chris, she entered the land under color of title. Though she only used the small two-acre piece of land, she had constructive use of the entirety of the property since Betty was not on the property in any capacity. Therefore, Debbie stands to take the whole of Greenacre. 4. Continous Debbie herself satisfied the statutory period of New Suffolk's AP statute by possessing the land for 10 years from 2009-2019. Should the dates not be a complete 10 years, though, she may tack on her father's possession time (Chris) so that in effect, her possession has spanned since 2001. Tacking is only possible with privity which is a voluntary transfer from the subsequent possessor, Chris. Chris voluntary left Greenacre to Debbie in his will which establishes both the voluntariness aspect and the subsequent possessor aspect as there was no gap in possession from the time Chris had the land and th time Debbie entered. Betty, though will argue that there was not continuous possessoin as Debbie only moved to the property in 2011 which leaves 2 years on Debbie's clock in terms of AP and a gap in the possession from Chris to Debbie. This is Betty's best argument, however, an AP'er does not need to spend every waking moment on the land in order to satisfy continuity of possession. It is fair to assume that Debbie, in constructing her house, visited the property more than one time before she moved their permanently. This land was previously a seasonal retreat so these visits, though infrequent satisfy. 5. Exclusive Debbie and Chris both clearly showed that their possession was exclusive by allowing their neighbors to enter the property with permission. This permission is the important piece as it shows that the public recognized that Chris and then Debbie respectively had the best claim to the land. Considering and analyzing all elements of AP, Debbie has a strong AP claim and would likely be able to gain control of the entirety of Greenacre under the constructive possession exception of Color of Title.

Can Brock make money from the developer considering that he is tenants in common with his Brother Alex? Tenancy in common have certain rules they have to follow, they are allowed to convey their interest in someone else, share the profits the land may make, and equally pay for necessary repairs. They are not subject to the four unities. Tenancy in common may be broken by ousting one or more tenants in common from the property, in which case they have a right to bring forth partition by kind or by sale to court. Even though Brock and Alex may very well have satisfied the four unities a court will not consider them joint tenant with the right of survivorship. The grant has to specifically say that and it does not. What someone else, share the profits the land may make, and equally pay for necessary repairs. They are not subject to the four unities. Tenancy in common may be broken by ousting one or more tenants in common from the property, in which case they have a right to bring forth partition by kind or by sale to court. Even though Brock and Alex may very well have satisfied the four unities a court will not consider them joint tenant with the right of survivorship. The grant has to specifically say that and it does not. What they are is tenants in common who both have an equal share of 50% in the land. When Brock was ousted from the property it allowed him to bring forward a suit against so he can sell the property to the developer. The court use two methods to settle these disputes, partion by kind or partition by sale. Court's prefer to do partition by kind, which allows them to distribute the property by the property percentage owned by each tenant in common. Partition by sale forces one or more owners to sell their property against their will. If a court finds in favor of Brock it will be by partition by kind. They are likely to give him the property that does not include the warehouse or the open taste room of the brewery. They will not do a partition by sale because they do not want to force Alex to sell his property interest that he has had before Brock bought into the company, just because Brock grew tired of brewing beer doesn't mean that Alex should have to suffer. The court will also likely find that having a brewery is good for the community, it brings in tax dollars, provides a service for residents and tourists, and is a place to congregate. A partition by kind giving Brock the area that is undeveloped allows him to sell to the Real estate developer satisfying his interest in selling the place. 1b What type of found property are the gold coins considered, and can Carl keep them? Finders law is settled law, there are five types of found property; abadoned, lost, mislaid, treasure trove, and embeded property. Each one has a specific set of rules that apply to them, abadoned property is created when someone gets rid of something they no longer want, belongs to whoever finds. Lost property is property that has been lost by the true owner. Once found the the true owner has until the statute of limitations runs out(generally a year) to find the property. Mislaid property is similar to lost property, the difference being the person purposefully put it somewhere and forgot where they put it. Treasure trove is generally antiques where the true owner is long gone and someone finds their property, the finder now owns the property. Embeded property is property in which embeded items are found, the owner of the property owns the items. property is property that has been lost by the true owner. Once found the the true owner has until the statute of limitations runs out(generally a year) to find the property. Mislaid property is similar to lost property, the difference being the person purposefully put it somewhere and forgot where they put it. Treasure trove is generally antiques where the true owner is long gone and someone finds their property, the finder now owns the property. Embeded property is property in which embeded items are found, the owner of the property owns the items. The coins are not abadoned property, it is highly unlikely that someone wanted to get rid of their property and decided they would abandon it by putting it under the base of the wall in a warehouse. It is also highly unlikely that it is lost property given where it was put. It is also unlikely that it is treasure trove property given that the bag the coins are in are from a grocery store that only opened ten years prior. If it were Carl might have a case that he found them, and the true owners are long dead therefore he is allowed to keep the coins, if they were dead it could be for a max of ten years and their heirs should be able to be tracked down and given the property. Mislaid property or embeded property are the two most likely types of property. Someone may have hid the coins in the wall for safe keeping and forgot about them. If the coins were not put their by Alex or Brock then Carl may be able to keep them if no true owner comes forward within the twelve month statute of limitations on mislaid/lost property. If a court decides that it is embedded property then Alex and Brock get to keep the coins because it was on their property. A court will likely find that coins are embedded property. The were in the wall embedded, hidden away. It is unlikely that someone mislaid a bag of valuable coins in the wall. Even if they did the court would likely find that it's been five years that Alex has owned the property and if it was mislaid it is now embedded property. Courts generally don't like lazy property owners, someone lost valuable coins and then the building was sold, that person can not come forward five years later when the property is found and claim it as their own, the court will likely give the coins to Alex and Brock as punishment for lazy property ownership. If the coins do belong to Alex or Brock and they mislaid the property there they will likely come forward and claim true ownership against the world. On top of that, it would be difficult for the court to figure out whether the property was pursposefully put their by Alex or Brock or mislaid there. The reason being is it is impossible to know whether or not they put the coins there on purpose or not. When Carl gave the brewery his Growler to hold did this create a bailment? What about his Coat? A bailment is created when posession of property(without title) is given to someone with the expectation that it will be given back in the same(or fixed) shape that it was given to the bailee, the bailee may have for the court to figure out whether the property was pursposefully put their by Alex or Brock or mislaid there. The reason being is it is impossible to know whether or not they put the coins there on purpose or not. When Carl gave the brewery his Growler to hold did this create a bailment? What about his Coat? A bailment is created when posession of property(without title) is given to someone with the expectation that it will be given back in the same(or fixed) shape that it was given to the bailee, the bailee may have to pay to recover the damages on the bailment. Full automation does not create a bailment generally. Carl gave the bartender his growler, the bartender gave him a claim ticket, this created a bailment. Carl had every expectation to recieve his growler back from the bartender and with no damage to it. Similar to a valet, if a valet takes your car and gives you a claim ticket and your car comes back damaged the valet or their company has to pay for your car to get fixed. The bartender knew the bailment was being created, gave him a ticket to prove the bailment, and the growler was either lost or destroyed. The coat on the other hand is a different story. Carl put his coat on the hook. You can't create a bailment with an inanimate object. If their were a person collecting coats then that might of created a bailment. He may have put his coat on the hook with the expectation that it would be there when he came back, but he never gave possession of his coat to someone, he left it somewhere. This is similar to the discussion in the Hyatt case, if a parking lot is fully automated and no one is really in charge of it there is usually no bailment created. A court will likely find that the brewery has to pay damages for the lost or destroyed growler because a bailment was created between Carl and the bartender. However, a court will likely not make the brewery pay for his coat as a coat hanger is a fully automated system that does not create a bailment. 1c David Developer a present interest in fee simple subject to executory interest. Frank and Fred have an executory interest in fee simple. Alex has no interest in the property. Edward has a present interest in fee simple determinable, Alex has future interest in right of re entry. The conveyance made to David is void under the rules of perpetuities. David's deed says that the property has to be used as a residential property if not it goes to Frank or Fred. Frank and Fred could both die and in 21 years David or his estate could use the property for commercial use. Even if the grant have didn't violate the rule of perpetuities Alex would still 8 no legal claim to the property. He sold his property interest to David, and gave his two sons an executory interest. Alex has no right to revert the property nor does he have a right of re entry. Frank and Fred, if this was valid, could claim that the have Edward has a present interest in fee simple determinable, Alex has future interest in right of re entry. The conveyance made to David is void under the rules of perpetuities. David's deed says that the property has to be used as a residential property if not it goes to Frank or Fred. Frank and Fred could both die and in 21 years David or his estate could use the property for commercial use. Even if the grant didn't violate the rule of perpetuities Alex would still have no legal claim to the property. He sold his property interest to David, and gave his two sons an executory interest. Alex has no right to revert the property nor does he have a right of re entry. Frank and Fred, if this was valid, could claim that the have legal right under their executory interest to take the property in a vested remainder in fee simple. Edward is subject to legal claims by Alex. Edward made an agreement with Alex that he would buy the property and if IPA's were ever made on the property he would have a right to re enter the property. Edward started to make IPA's, so Alex can re enter the property. This is valid under the rule of perpetuitites because it does not apply to future interests of the grantor(Alex). Alex can reclaim the property from Alex. There is an off chance that a court may find in favor of Edward because people like IPA's and Alex's stringent rules are putting a choke hold on his business which is harming the economy. That is unlikely though, future interests and estates are generally settled law and there is a correct answer. "," Who has legal claim to the Greenacre Property? Adverse posession is created when the adverse possessors is hostile, exclusive, open and notorius, actual, and continous. Color of title is when a bad deed is made for a property, if the person lives on the property past the statute of limitations like an adverse possessor the property is theres. When adversely possessed property is conveyed to someone else the adverse possession time tacks on(Cahill). Chris bought greenacre under color of tile in 2001, he did not realize that Betty's name was forged. He did not ask for permission to live on or use the property because he thought in good faith that it belonged to him. During the weeks he was on greenacre he excluded his neighbors from using the property to hunt and fish while he was there, he allowed them when he was not there. The property was able to be seen by the neighbors, and the neighbors knew where his property was because they used it to hunt. It was open and notorius. He acted as an actual property owner would, he took walks around the property, fished in the river nearby, he insulated the cabin and made regular repairs. He continously visited until his death in 2009 when his daughter was given the property. Debbie also never asked did not ask for permission to live on or use the property because he thought in good faith that it belonged to him. During the weeks he was on greenacre he excluded his neighbors from using the property to hunt and fish while he was there, he allowed them when he was not there. The property was able to be seen by the neighbors, and the neighbors knew where his property was because they used it to hunt. It was open and notorius. He acted as an actual property owner would, he took walks around the property, fished in the river nearby, he insulated the cabin and made regular repairs. He continously visited until his death in 2009 when his daughter was given the property. Debbie also never asked permission to live on the property, she thought in good faith the property truly belonged to her. She exlcluded her neighors from hunting on two acres of her property and they can't enter without her permission, but allows them to hunt everywhere else. Same as her father her neighbors know where the property is as they know where they can and can't hunt. She planted a garden, built a year round house and lives there continously for 10 years. Betty may argue that her dead husband was not allowed to sell the property without her permission and the deed is void because of it. This could have been true, but color of title is not exlcuded from the statute of limitations. She may also argue that Debbie was not there long enough to adversly possess it. However, getting property that has been adversly possessed does not start the statute of limitations over again, it simply just tacks on and nineteen years is plenty of time to adversely posess property and the law states that ten years is enough, which is how long Debbie has owned the property anyways. If hypothetically it was less than ten years Betty may argue that Chris did not act as an actual property owner, because there was no home and much of greenacre was undeveloped, and that he wasn't there continously because it was only eight weeks out of the year. However, there is no specific guidelines for actual in adverse possession, it is likely that fishing, and insulating the cabin are sufficient to satisfy this, and same for continous, you do not have to adversely possess a place every day for ten years straight to satsfy the continous element. He was there eight weeks, that should satisfy it. A court will likely find that Debbie is the true owner against all claims. She and her father clearly satsified the elements of adverse possesion past the statute of limitations. The bad deed is also fine because it was past the statute of limitations. Chris did not purchase this in bad faith, knowing that it was illegal, he didn't even realize that it wasn't her signature, which could have changed things because bad faith purchases do not give someone property rights. Debbie is likely the true owner of greenacre after it has been adversely possessed for nineteen years. ",169,2020,742
a503bcd8-7709-45ef-b48f-d56131f99108," Connor and Carla have a contigent remainder in life estate Any future children have an executory interest Robert has a life estate Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple Vivian and any future grandchildren have an executory interest Because Victor is already over 25, Oliver does not have a reverter or any other interest in the estate Connor and Carla's contigent remainder in life estate is void under the rule against perpetuities (RAP) because Oliver is the life in vest and if he dies tomrorrow, it might be more than 21 years before either child retires. Any furture children's executory interest is void under RAP because if Oliver has another child then dies, in 21 years the child will be in college and cannot retire from a full time job. Robert's life estate is valid under RAP because RAP does not effect life estates. Victor's vested remainder is valid under RAP because he is already 26, older than 25, so even if all other possible lives in vest die, Victor's interest will immeadiately vest. Vivan's executory interest is valid under RAP because in 21 years she will be 28, which is older than 25, so even if all other lives in vest die, she will be older than 25 in 21 years and the interest will vest. Any future grandchildren's is void under RAP because if they are born and all other lives in vest die the next day, they would be 21 in 21 years, which is less than 25, so the interest would not vest. The rewritten grant would be ""To my nephew Robert for life, then to my grandchildren, currently alive, who reach the age of 25."" 2) Any future grandchildren's is void under RAP because if they are born and all other lives in vest die the next day, they would be 21 in 21 years, which is less than 25, so the interest would not vest. The rewritten grant would be ""To my nephew Robert for life, then to my grandchildren, currently alive, who reach the age of 25."" "," A.) First, Brock and his brother are tenants in common. This means that they each hold their own interest (in this case, 50% and 50%) and can do what they want with that interest. However, the grant states that the two brothers hold the property ""jointly as tenants in common."" This could be interpretted as a joint tenancy that cannot be unilaterally severed but because it does not include anything about the right to suriviorship, and labels the tenants as tenants in common, a court would find that the specific language necessary to create a joint tenancy is missing and therefore, the brothers are tenants in common. The issue presented by Brock is whether he can make money from the developer with his interest in the property the brewery is on. The rule that would apply is the rule for how a tenency in common can be severed. Tenancies in common can be unilaterally severed, meaning that both parties do not have to consent to the sever, so Brock could sever his interest with Alex and sell his half to the developer for some of the $2 million being offered. B.) The first issue presented by Carl is his legal rights towards the discovery of gold coins. The rule that would be applied comes from the Wenner case. In that case, contruction workers found gold coins in a bag, wanted to keep them, but had to surrender them to the property owner. The result in this case would be the same. Because Carl found the coins in the wall of the brewery, the coins are imbedded property, meaning that whoever owns the property the coins were imbedded in also owns the coins. However, the coins were found in a bag from a local and still existing grocery store. This means that the coins found their way into the wall of the brewery within the last 10 years. So the owner of the coins could very well be alive. This could mean that instead of imbedded property, this is a case of found property. If that is the case, then the rule from Armory applies. In that case, a jewel was found and not given back to the person who found it. That case established that the first finder has a supiror claim to everyone else, except the true owner. If the coins are found property, then untill the true owner comes forward, Carl has the right to the coins. This being said, it is most likely that these coins are imbedded property because they were found in a small hole in the wall of the brewery. It seems unlikely that coins mistakenly dropped on the sidewalk would be well wrapped and end up in a hole in a wall. Because of could very well be alive. This could mean that instead of imbedded property, this is a case of found property. If that is the case, then the rule from Armory applies. In that case, a jewel was found and not given back to the person who found it. That case established that the first finder has a supiror claim to everyone else, except the true owner. If the coins are found property, then untill the true owner comes forward, Carl has the right to the coins. This being said, it is most likely that these coins are imbedded property because they were found in a small hole in the wall of the brewery. It seems unlikely that coins mistakenly dropped on the sidewalk would be well wrapped and end up in a hole in a wall. Because of this, Brock and Alex have the best claim to the coins. The next issue is Carl's legal rights towards his broken growler. The rule that would be applied in this case would be from Hyatt Hotel, where someone's car was stolen when that person reasonably blieved that Hyatt would protect his car from damages and theft. This case established a rule on bailments and that any place where a person had a reasonable expectation of security for their property can charge that place with negligence. In this case, it would seem that Carl had a reasonable expectation that is growler would not be broken because he had taken his gowler there before without issue and because it is a brewery that deals with many other growlers. However, the brewery could argue that they were not negligent becuase the growler was dropped by accident by a new employee that did not know how to properly handle them. Also, Carl's sentimental feeling towards the growler has no effect on the argument because the brewery did not know how speical it was to Carl. This being said, Carl's reasonable belief that his growler would be taken care of is stronger than the arugment of the accidental destruction of the growler becuase it is reasonable for a person to believe that their glass countainer for beer would be taken care of at a place that sells beer. The final issue Carl raised what about his coat that was taken from the brewery. The rule that applies here comes from the Medina case, where a purse of money was left and a barbershop. That case established the rule for mislaid property which stated that mislaid property belonged to the owner of the establishment the object was left in hopes of the original owner coming back to find it. That would apply to this case assuming that the coat was taken by accident and that the person who took it would come back to the brewery and say that they accidently took the wrong coat. Then Carl would have to return to the bewery and ask if anyone had surrendered a coat. However, Carl did not try very hard to look for his coat. He could have asked the people in the room or the bartender if there was a coat matching his laying around somewhere else. Even so, the best thing for Carl to do now would be to alert the bewery of the theft (puposeful or not) so if anyone surrenders the mistaken coat, they know to alert be best becasue the coat is mislaid property Carl. Also, bringing the coat back to the brewery 4would that the store is entitled to. return to the bewery and ask if anyone had surrendered a coat. However, Carl did not try very hard to look for his coat. He could have asked the people in the room or the bartender if there was a coat matching his laying around somewhere else. Even so, the best thing for Carl to do now would be to alert the bewery of the theft (puposeful or not) so if anyone surrenders the mistaken coat, they know to alert Carl. Also, bringing the coat back to the brewery would be best becasue the coat is mislaid property that the store is entitled to. C.) First concerning David and the residential property, the grant gave David a fee simple subject to executory interest and gave Alex's sons Frank and Fred an executory interest. The condition the grant rested upon was that the property was used for residential purposes only. Because David broke that condition by creating stores, the interest in the property goes to Frank and Fred, assuming they are of legal age. David could argue that the majority of the property is being used for residential purposes but that is not what the grant states. The grant states that the property can only be used for residential puproses, which it currently is not, so Alex's sons get the property interest in fee simple. So to regain control of the property, Alex's sons (again assuming legal age) can file against David in court and would most likely win the property interest. Now concerning Edward and the brewery, the grant gave Edward a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and gave Alex the right to reentry. The condition Edward had to satify was to never brew IPAs. Now that he has brewed IPAs, Alex has the right to reenter the property and in doing so, takes back his interest in those 5 arces only. So to regain control of the property, Alex needs to reenter it. 3) "," First, Betty would claim that Debbie was tresspassing on her property becuase Betty was never made aware of the sale. The validity of the deed would be brought into consideration because Andrew foraged her signature. However, Deddie would argue that her father Chris was a good faith purchaser, like in Nowlin, and should not be held responsible. Chris did not know what Andrew's realationship with Betty was like so when he saw her signature on the deed it was reasonable for him to assume that Betty was aware of and consented to the sale. Because of this, the court could consider Chris a good faith purchaser because he did not mean to buy the land behind Betty's back. However, even if the the deed is ruled illegal, Debbie would still own the land through adverse possession. Becasue Debbie and Chris had stayed on the land and improved it for 18 years, longer than that statute of limitations for New Suffolk. They would qualify for adverse possession because they with Betty was like so when he saw her signature on the deed it was reasonable for him to assume that Betty was aware of and consented to the sale. Because of this, the court could consider Chris a good faith purchaser because he did not mean to buy the land behind Betty's back. However, even if the the deed is ruled illegal, Debbie would still own the land through adverse possession. Becasue Debbie and Chris had stayed on the land and improved it for 18 years, longer than that statute of limitations for New Suffolk. They would qualify for adverse possession because they satify all of the requirements. Debbie and her father did not hide the houses (open and notrious), they used the property often (continuous), they used it without Betty's knowledge (hostile), they actaully possessed the land, and they made sure that there was a part of the property, the cabin and later the house, that only they used (exclusive). However, you could aruge that the hostility requirement is not fufilled. The hostile requirement makes it so the adverse possessors possess the land without the rightful owner's knowledge and Andrew, one of the rightful owners had knowledge of their possession. Even so, the only owner that matters in this case is Debbie and she was no aware of the possession. Debbie's interest is the one that matters because her and Andrew owned Greenacre as tenants by the entirety. Tenants by the entirety have the right to suvivorship so all of Andrew's interests would disapear and would become Betty's interest. Also, it could be argued that the exclusive requirement was not fufilled because both Chris and Debbie let their neighbors use the property. This arguement would not stand because Chris and Betty never let the others use their cabin or house, so their use for that part of the property was exlusive. In addition, Debbie is not an outdoor person and did not really care about the other 48 acres that her neighbors used. Another counterargument to Debbie's adverse possession claim is that she was only on the property for seven years, which is less than the ten required by the statute of limitations. This argument would not stand up in court because Debbie can tack on the time that Chris spent on the property because Greenacre was legally conffered to Debbie and the time can be tacked on because of the ruling in a case where a disputed strip of property used to park cars for a daycare was ruled as adversely possessed because the first owners legally sold their property to the new ones. Becaue of the above, Debbie would be able to keep Greenacre because Chris was a good faith purchaser or because she adversely possessed the land. ",348,1373,630
fe25f63c-223b-4a54-bc0c-9af412bc1911," At the time of the grant, Oliver has a present possessory interest in Fee Simple subject to executory limitation. Oliver's children have a springing executory interest in life estate. This is an springing executory interest as the Grantor, Oliver, is keeping possession of the estate, but when his first child retires, the interest will spring to that first child. Oliver's nephew Robert would have a vested remainder in life estate. Oliver's grandchild Victor would have a vested remainder in Fee Simple subject to partial divestment. However, since Vivian has not met the requirement of being 25, she would have a contingent remainder in fee simple, the contingency being living to be 25 years old. The Rule Against Perpetuities only applies to four types of future interests, which are executory interests, contingent remainders, interests subject to open(partial divestment), and option contracts. Here, since the Rule Against Perpetuities does not apply to the vested remainders, it does not apply to Robert's vested remainder in life estate. The clasue of the conveyance that states ""to my first child to retire, for life"" would violate the Rule Against Perpetuities as this is a grant and a devise executed by a will. This means that the class of Oliver's children is still open. Oliver could have a 3rd child,Kaylee, the next day, everyone dies, and Kaylee could retire 80 years after the end of all validating lives at the time of conveyance. Since it could vest or fail within 21 years of all lives in being, it would be invalid. Normally, the clause stating ""to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25"" would violate the Rule Against Perpetuities as all lives in being could die except one of Oliver's child, Connor, who has a child the next day, then Connor dies. In this scenario the grandchild would take 25 years, after the end of all lives in being at the time of the conveyance, for the interest to vest. However, modern courts usually Kaylee could retire 80 years after the end of all validating lives at the time of conveyance. Since it could vest or fail within 21 years of all lives in being, it would be invalid. Normally, the clause stating ""to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25"" would violate the Rule Against Perpetuities as all lives in being could die except one of Oliver's child, Connor, who has a child the next day, then Connor dies. In this scenario the grandchild would take 25 years, after the end of all lives in being at the time of the conveyance, for the interest to vest. However, modern courts usually recognize the ""Rule of Convenience"" which allows otherwise invalid clauses that grant an interest subject to partial divestment to be valid. Here, at the time of conveyance, Vivian is a grandchild of Oliver and has reached the age of 25. In this case, the court would likely close the class with Vivian but uphold her vested remainder in fee simple (which would convert to a vested remainder in fee simple absolute, as no other grandchild can join the class after it is closed) Oliver's keeps a present possessory interest in the life estate and conveyance limits his title to spring to a grantee. The Rule Against Perpetuities only applies to future interests, so there is no need to apply it here. "," Dear Brock, You have multiple options you can take regarding the purchase of your property, but first you must understand what you actually own and what you are able to do. When Alex drafted the deed that stated that you were both to hold ""jointly as tenants in common"", Alex granted you both a 50% interest in the land as tenants in common. Even though Alex used the language ""Jointly"" he also ended the deed with ""tenants in common."" When there is a ambiguity in the language of the will, Courts are likely to find that a Tenancy in Common exists over a creation of a Joint Tenancy. This is due to the Court being weary of granting the right of survivorship, which is a right that Joint Tenants have that Tenants in Common do not, when the person conveying the interest does not intend to do so. There is no indication that Alex is a law trained reader, and he may have put jointly for other reasons besides the explicit intention to create a Joint Tenancy. As a tenant in common, you (Brock) own a fractional, separate share of the entirety of the property. This means you and Alex are able to fully use the entirety of the property, but only have a 1/2 interest in language of the will, Courts are likely to find that a Tenancy in Common exists over a creation of a Joint Tenancy. This is due to the Court being weary of granting the right of survivorship, which is a right that Joint Tenants have that Tenants in Common do not, when the person conveying the interest does not intend to do so. There is no indication that Alex is a law trained reader, and he may have put jointly for other reasons besides the explicit intention to create a Joint Tenancy. As a tenant in common, you (Brock) own a fractional, separate share of the entirety of the property. This means you and Alex are able to fully use the entirety of the property, but only have a 1/2 interest in the value of the property. This also means that, as a Tenant in Common, you may convey or sell your 1/2 interest to whomever you would like without any agreement from your brother, Alex. A main issue here is what you are able to sell. There are two options you have regarding the partition and sale of your property. However, there are multiple issues that would likely come up if you move to partition your land. The first option would be a partition in kind, where in this case, you would physically partition the property, here you would be able to sell 5 acres of the property as you have a 50% interest in the property, while Alex could stay and keep his interest in the remaining 5 acres.However, you would have to convince the real estate developer to purchase only 5 acres instead of the aforementioned ten acres. However, if a partition in kind is equal in square footage but are drastically different in property value (i.e. 1/ property with a beach side view, while the other 1/2 having a view of a swamp) the benefitting party may be ordered by the court to pay an Owelty fee to the other, which is the court's way of making the outcome more equitable. Your second option would be to could convince Alex to commit to a partition by sale, in which you sell the entirety of the property, and split the profits according to your interests. Partitions in sale are granted when a physical partition would be impracticable, such as have a lack of sufficient access roads, and the rights of all parties would be benefitted by the sale. However, Courts would also consider the Personality Interest of the property as well as the parties' Financial Interest. Brock would have a strong claim for partition by sale as there is no indication that dividing the land physically is impracticable, and the price of sale offered by the real estate agent is ""far more than the property is worth"" and allow for Alex to buy land not too far to move his brewery to. However, Alex would likely turn the Court's decision in Delfino v. Valeancis, which, similarly, involded two tenants in common, where one sought a partition by sale while the other sought a partition in kind. In that case, the property was able to be physically divided and it would financially benefit both parties, however, the Court considered one of the cotenant's Personality Interest in the property. A personality interest physically is impracticable, and the price of sale offered by the real estate agent is ""far more than the property is worth"" and allow for Alex to buy land not too far to move his brewery to. However, Alex would likely turn the Court's decision in Delfino v. Valeancis, which, similarly, involded two tenants in common, where one sought a partition by sale while the other sought a partition in kind. In that case, the property was able to be physically divided and it would financially benefit both parties, however, the Court considered one of the cotenant's Personality Interest in the property. A personality interest would be defined as a sentimental or emotional tie to the property in question. Another similarity to Delfino was the party not seeking sale ran a grabage removal business on the property, like Alex's Brewery. Like the Personality Interest tied to the property, the Court also considered the business owner's financial interest tied to the land, and the burden of moving ones business to another location. The Court decided that the businessowning Cotenant's financial interest and personality interests outweighed other interests, and a partition in kind was order. Here, Alex was invested in the property both financially and emotionally. Alex's love for the property and his other sentimental ties would be considered by a court, as well as the burden that would be moving his Brewery would cause on Alex and weighed against the benefit of selling for 2 million dollars. Even though courts favor partitions by sale (as they are more likely to result in a more equitable outcome for all parties) the court, considering all attendant circumstances, would likely consider both Alex's sentimental interest in the property as well as his financial interest as being valid and outweighing the benefit that would brough by sale. Thus, the court would likely order a partition in kind where Alex would keep the acreage on which his business is run, and allow Brock to claim ownership to the other half of acreage where the business is not, and he may in turn sell those 5 acres. 3) Dear Carl, The Coins To determine whether or not Carl has a rightful claim to the coins, the Court must determine what kind of found property it would constitute as. Carl found the gold coins, wrapped in a garbage bag, under the warehouse wall of the property owned by Alex and Brock. The Coins To determine whether or not Carl has a rightful claim to the coins, the Court must determine what kind of found property it would constitute as. Carl found the gold coins, wrapped in a garbage bag, under the warehouse wall of the property owned by Alex and Brock. These coins would likely be defined as a lost property. Lost property is found property that has been lost by its original owner, the finder of lost property has a superior title to all other claims to property except a prior finder or the original owner. It is lost as there is no indication that it was carefully placed there and forgotten about, if so they would constitute as Mislaid Property where the owners of the location found would have a superior title over a finder. The coins were found in a small hole, underneath a wall. Although this would technically be the definition of Treasure Trove, which constitutes as buried gold coins or bullions, American courts do not recognize Treasure Trove as a valid form of Lost Property, also, Treasure Trove may not apply. Even though the coins are aged to be around 200 years old, they were still carefully wrapped in a grocery bag, which would not have existed at the time of the coins creation or usage. Therefore they may have not been buried for centuries, perhaps being there for only a couple days. Lastly, there is no indication that the coins were abandoned. No fact suggests someone got tired of owning priceless coins and decided to extinguish their title to them. So a court would most likely find the coins to be lost property. However, the property was taken from another person's property. Since the coins were underneath the wall of Alex and Brock's establishment, it would likely be found that Alex and Brock have a superior claim to the coins. A trespasser cannot enter someone else's property and take lost items from their property. Although the coins were found in the ground and the owners, Alex and Brock, have no knowledge to their existence, the Court would still likely find that Alex and Brock to have superior claim to the coins. The court would likely want to disuade people from entering onto others properties to take precious items, even if they appear to be lost property. For all Carl knew, those gold coins could have been there because Alex and Brock distruct the bank and would rather stow their savings underneath their building for safe keeping. For the purposes of preventing trespass and theft, the court would likely force Carl to return the coins to Alex and Brock. The Growler coins. The court would likely want to disuade people from entering onto others properties to take precious items, even if they appear to be lost property. For all Carl knew, those gold coins could have been there because Alex and Brock distruct the bank and would rather stow their savings underneath their building for safe keeping. For the purposes of preventing trespass and theft, the court would likely force Carl to return the coins to Alex and Brock. The Growler The main issue regarding the Growler is whether or not there was a bailment relationship established between Carl and the Bartender. The Court would likely rely on decision made in Allen v. Hyatt, in which a bailment relationship was found to be established between emplyees of a parking garage and a customer parking their car. In that case, the Court found that due to the nature and circumstances (i.e. the garage was ticketed, monitored by security guards, and was indoors) of the parking garage, there was an implied bailment relationship, meaning their was also an implied duty of care that was necessary in watching the customer's car. In that case, the customer received a ticket when he entering disclaiming that there was no bailment relationship and that they were parking there on their own risk of losing their car. However, the Court found that claim tickets that have language stating that a bailment relationship does not exist is insufficient to negate a bailment relationship. Here, the court would likely find that a bailment relationship existed. Bailment relationships are established when a a customer pays to have their clothes dry cleaned, as they are foregoing their current right to possession to the Dry Cleaners, but retains all other rights to the clothes. When a customer pays for dry cleaning, there is also an implied duty that the establishment will undertake a reasonable duty of care as to the clothes. Carl's situation is no different. When Carl entrusted his Growler to be filled by the bartender, with a claim ticket for extra measure, there was an implied duty of reasonable care communicated to the bartender. By allowing the growler to shatter while in possession of it would break this duty of care. Therefore, the Court, to encourage those who take temporary possession of others' valuable items, would likely hold that there was a bailment relationship established between Carl and the Bartender, and Carl would likely be able to obtain damages as to his destroyed property. The Coat As to the Coat, there are no facts indicating what happened to the coat besides it being gone when Carl returned. The person who took may try to argue that the coat was abandoned as Carl exclaimed ""Forget it"" and The Coat As to the Coat, there are no facts indicating what happened to the coat besides it being gone when Carl returned. The person who took may try to argue that the coat was abandoned as Carl exclaimed ""Forget it"" and left without searching further for it, however, this was done after the coat had been taken. This would mean that the Coat was taken before it had been abandoned meaning that Carl would still likely retain his claim to the coat against whomever took it. Carl would also likely argue that ""Forget it"" does not equate to voluntarily extinguishing his title to it. The Court would likely find that Carl would still be the rightful owner, as the court would not want to encourage others to steal from others under that guise that they believed it to be abandoned. 4) David Alex's deed to David would likely grant David a present possessory interest in a Fee simple Subject to Condition Subsequent. Although the deed in question uses ""so long as"" a phase of duration, the Court would likely find that the second clause starting with ""if it is ever used for non-residential purpose"" would create a Fee Simple Subject ot Condition Subsequent. The court would likely rely on the ruling in Ford v. Allen, where a similar language of duration was used in a conveyance yet it was decided that it was in essence a FSCCS. Courts prefer to grant FSCCSs whent there is an ambiguity in the conveyance as they prevent Grantees from automatically losing property like in Fee Simple Determinables. Edward For the same reasons as above Alex's deed to Edward would likely be found to be a Fee Simple Subject to Condtion Subsequent, with Edward's condition being not making IPAs, whereas David's would be to use the land for non-residential purposes. Frank and Fred For the same reasons as above Alex's deed to Edward would likely be found to be a Fee Simple Subject to Condtion Subsequent, with Edward's condition being not making IPAs, whereas David's would be to use the land for non-residential purposes. Frank and Fred Frank and Fred would have a shifting executory interest, since they would cut short David's property interest if he were to use the land for non-residential purposes. In 2017 By 2017, both David and Edward, broke the conditions place upon them in their respective deeds. David began using the property for non-residential purposes, whereas Edward used the premises to make IPAs, meanign that Alex would be able to bring a claim against them in court to extinguish their interests in the property. Since the grants are not Fee Simple Determinable, which automatically revert to the owner upon meeting the condition set, but FCSSCs, this means that David and Edward will keep their interests in the property, even though they broke the conditions of their deeds, until Alex brings a claim in court against. Although tedious, the court would likely extinguish both David's and Edward's interests in the property as they explicitly broke the conditions set forth in their deeds. Davids deed, however, violates the RAP as Fred and Frank's interest may vest in their respective estates far past the deaths of all lives in being alive at the time of the conveyance. The RAP would apply as Frank and Fred's interests are executory intrerests, which apply under the RAP. After applying the RAP, the court may just construe the grant as being "" "," Andrew and Betty Andrew and Betty owned multiple pieces of property as Tenants by the Entirety. A tenancy by the entirety is created when a married couple are granted property while satisfying the four unities. These unities being that the couple received the property at the same time, the couple share the same Andrew and Betty Andrew and Betty owned multiple pieces of property as Tenants by the Entirety. A tenancy by the entirety is created when a married couple are granted property while satisfying the four unities. These unities being that the couple received the property at the same time, the couple share the same title, the couple share an equal interest in the property, and both spouses have equal ability to possess and use the entirety of the property. Also, like Joint Tenants, Tenants by the entirety have the right to survivorship. Here, Betty and Andrew appear to satify all 4 unities and meet the necessary requirement of being married before becoming Tenants by the Entirety. However, unlike Joint Tenants, Andrew cannot unilaterally sever his interest, without the agreement of his spouse, Betty. Meaning that he cannot grant Blackacre to someone else, and in drafting the deed, did not in fact grant any property to Chris, meaning Chris would be given a faulty deed and would believe to own it under a color of title. Debbie The main issue here is whether Debbie has rightful claim of Greenacre through the process of Adverse Possession. To be able to make a rightful claim through adverse possession, the claimant must satisfy 5 key elements. First, their use of the property must be Open and Notorious, in that they are not hiding their possession of the property, and there use is sufficient enough that the true owner, with reasonable inspection, would be notified of their possession. The notice may be Actual Notice, meaning that the original owner, themself, are witness to the Adverse Possessor's use, or Constructive Notice, meaning that their use is so open that the owner ""ought to know"" that the claimant was adversely possessing the land. The original need not be notified herself that the Adverse Possessor lives on the land, only that a reasonable owner would have known in their situation. Second, the claimant's use of the land must be Hostile, meaning that they are in possession of the property without the permission of the original owner. Jurisdiction differ as to whether to require a Good Faith Requirement, a Bad Faith Requirement, or apply an objective standard to the claimant's intent. A Good Faith Requirement requires that the claimaint honestly believe that they are the rightful owner of the land, whereas a Bad Faith Requirement requires that the claimant know they are on another person's land and they intend to take possession through Adverse Possession. However, the majority of Second, the claimant's use of the land must be Hostile, meaning that they are in possession of the property without the permission of the original owner. Jurisdiction differ as to whether to require a Good Faith Requirement, a Bad Faith Requirement, or apply an objective standard to the claimant's intent. A Good Faith Requirement requires that the claimaint honestly believe that they are the rightful owner of the land, whereas a Bad Faith Requirement requires that the claimant know they are on another person's land and they intend to take possession through Adverse Possession. However, the majority of Courts apply the objective standard and do not consider the actual intent of the claimant, only requiring that there is no manifestation of permission granted to the claimant by the original owner. Third, the claimant's use of the land must be actual, in that there use is similar to that of what a natural owner would use the property for. For instance, a claimant adversely possessing lake swims and fishes from the lake, a natural owner of a lake would likely do the same and this element would be satisfied. Fourth, the claimant's use of the land must be Continous. The claimant's time of possessio, starting from the time of entry, must toll past the required time allotted in the Statute of Limitations. Here in New Suffolk, the Statute of Limitations require that the claimant be in possession for at least ten years. The Court would also need to determine whether Debbie would be able to tack her Father's time on to her time in possession. Under the ruling of Tieu v. Morgan, an Adverse Possessor who receives the property in question from a predecessor who was also Adversely Possessing may be able to tack on the Predecessor's time to theirs in order to reach the required statute of limitations. This can only be done when the predecessor grants their adversely possessed property ""in privy"", meaning through sale or otherwise valid conveyance. Lastly, the claimant's use of the land must be Exclusive, in that they are exclusively owning the property and do not share it with others. Claimants may show this by exercising their right to exclude and permit others onto the property. Open and Notorious : Here, Debbie's use of the land would likely be found to be Open and Notorious, as she had cleared acres of trees to create gardens. The Court would likely find that the rightful would have taken notice of the adverse possession under a reasonable inspection, meaning that Debbie's use of the land would satisfy this requirement. Hostile: Here, Debbie's use of the land would likely be found to be Open and Notorious, as she had cleared notice acres of trees to create gardens. The Court would likely find that the rightful would have taken PROPERTY_102�1C_Infranca_FL the adverse possession under a reasonable inspection, meaning that Debbie's use of the land would satisfy this requirement. Hostile: Since Debbie believes she was given title through Chris, and has never gained explicit permission to be on the property from Betty, the Court would likely find that she satisfies the Hostility Requirement. Likewise, like the majority of courts, the New Suffolk court would likely apply an object standard and not consider Debbie's actual knowledge or intent as to the hostility requirement. Actual: Although her use of the land differs from that of her father or Andrew and Betty, clearing woods to make gardens, although slightly unconventional, are actions that a reasonable, natural owner may take with a property like Greenacre. Betty may, most likely unsuccessfully, challenge this claim, asserting that clearing woods for a garden not be an action similar to that of a natural owner. The Court would likely find that unpersuasive and find Debbie's use as being actual. Continuous: Debbie was conveyed the property from her Father Chris, not knowing that it originated from a faulty deed, and moved there in 2011. Her time adversely possessing would stop at 2019, when she is discovered by Betty to be on the property. The Court would likely find that although she took a 2 year gap to build a home before moving there, she would be able to tack on the time allotted by her Father Chris. Debbie's Father Chris entered the property in 2001, in which his use also satisified the 5 necessary requirements of adverse possession: ON: Chris' long outdoor walks and construction as to the cabin would satisfy his use as being Open and Notorious, as the rightful owner would be able to learn of his occupation under reasonable inspection. H: Chris was there under a Color of Title, honestly believing himself to be the sole owner, and not there on the express permission of Andrew or Betty, satisfying the Hostile requirement. A: Chris used the nature property for long walks and fishing, and although he only stayed there for 8 ON: Chris' long outdoor walks and construction as to the cabin would satisfy his use as being Open and Notorious, as the rightful owner would be able to learn of his occupation under reasonable inspection. H: Chris was there under a Color of Title, honestly believing himself to be the sole owner, and not there on the express permission of Andrew or Betty, satisfying the Hostile requirement. A: Chris used the nature property for long walks and fishing, and although he only stayed there for 8 weeks a year, a natural owner could likely do the same with a vacation cottage. C: Chris adversely possessed the property for 9 years before conveying it to Debbie, in privity (Required for Tacking) E: Chris would permit others to fish and hunt on his land, exercising his right to exclude, the court would likely find his use to be Exclusive. Because Chris's successfully satisfied all requirements of Adverse Possession, the time he tolled towards the Statute of Limitations would be able to be tacked onto Debbie's allotted time. Since Debbie may tack on Chris' time, she would have satisfied the time condition required for Adverse Possession in 2011, as it would be past the ten year requirement necessary for New Suffolk's Statute. Exclusive: The Court would likely find that Debbie's use of the property was exclusive as she exercised her right to exclide by permitting neighbors to enter 48 acres of land, but excluding them from the remaining two acres. Arguments against Debbie Betty may try and argue that Debbie's use was not continuous as there was a 2 year gap between her father's death and her entry onto the land. However, this was a reasonable gap in absence as a natural owner could likely do the same. A natural may receive a conveyance for property and order the construction of a home on it, and only enter upon its completion. Therefore the court would likely find this to not break the time tolled towards the statute of limitation. Courts favor the grant of adverse possession as a way to encourage owners to be mindful of their property and encourage beneficial use be made to the land. Many American courts would prefer that Debbie be able to beautify the property of another the other has never even visited, maintained, or 13when even seen the land that they owned. Applying Adverse Possessions promotes beneficial land use as opposed to land staying untouched by lazy, distant owners. construction of a home on it, and only enter upon its completion.

Victor has a vested remainder in fee simple subject to an open class. Vivian has a contingent remainder in fee simple.

Victor's and Vivian's interests would both be void under the rule becasue when there could be an afterborn child of Oliver or grandchild that was born after the conveyance and that child could not reach the age of 25 before the perpetuities period, meaning that we will not know whether Victor and Vivian's interst vests or fails within the period. 2) "," Dear Brock, Thank you for contacting me regarding the issue of whether or not you have the right to sell the the property you own as tenants in common with your brother Alex. I understand that you would like to make as much money as you can from the developer and I will be happy to help you in this endevor. I discuss possible solutions to your problem below, please reach out to me if you have any questions, concerns, or need more details on my explaination. Since you are a tenant in common with your brother in the property you possess 1/ the interest in the property. This means that you are free to do as you wish with you share, this means that you could sell your 1/2 interest in the property to the real estate developer on your own without your brother's permission. This is not likely to allow you to receive the most money possible from the real estate developer because they most likely want the entire property. In cases where there is contention between concerns, or need more details on my explaination. Since you are a tenant in common with your brother in the property you possess 1/ the interest in the property. This means that you are free to do as you wish with you share, this means that you could sell your 1/2 interest in the property to the real estate developer on your own without your brother's permission. This is not likely to allow you to receive the most money possible from the real estate developer because they most likely want the entire property. In cases where there is contention between interest holders there is an option to bring the issue to court and have the court decide if there should be a partition. A partition can happen in two ways, one is a partition by sale, which would allow for the enitre property to be sold, and each of you would receive you 1/2 interest in the value of the property. Another option is a partition in-kind. The courts often favor a partition in-kind, but sometimes it is not practicle. In Delfino the court ruled that a partition by sale should only be granted when a partition in- kind is impractical for some reason and when the interests of both parties are best suited by the sale. Since you are the party that would be requesting the partition by sale (if you decide to go with this option) you would have the burden of proving why the sale was best for both parties involved. Proving the sale is best for you and your brother may be difficult. This is becasue it appears that your brother has a sentimental connection with the brewery and the court in Delfino reasoned that sentimental value should be taken into account in partition matters because it is not fair to force someone to leave their property, especially when they have a senimental connection to the land. A partition in-kind may be possible becasue there does not seem to be any issue with the partition in- kind being impractical, there may be an issue splitting up the land becasue of the the mulitple buldings that are on the land. It may be difficult for the court to split up the land and ensure that both you and your brother are receiving a share of land that is equal in value. The land with or without the buildings may be more valuable and thus cause a proble deciphering shares. The partition by sale does not seem to be a viable option here becasue as mentioned above your brother seems unlikely to want to sell, and has a connection to the land. This means that the courts will not likely order a sale. If you were to be granted a partition in-kind you would be able to sell your share of the land to the real estate developers. This seems like your best option in the current situation if you would like to sell your interest. Another available option is to recover rental income from your brother as it appears he may have ousted you from the property. According to Martin a co-tenant may not recover rental income from another co-tenant unless they have been ousted or there is an agreement to pay. Since your brother yelled ""now get out of here and don't come back,"" you may have a case that he ousted you. In order to be liable for ousting you must show that your brother had excusive possession of the property and Another available option is to recover rental income from your brother as it appears he may have ousted you from the property. According to Martin a co-tenant may not recover rental income from another co-tenant unless they have been ousted or there is an agreement to pay. Since your brother yelled ""now get out of here and don't come back,"" you may have a case that he ousted you. In order to be liable for ousting you must show that your brother had excusive possession of the property and denied you rights of title and interest. Also, you have to show that you received notice of the ousting or that the acts of the ouster were so open and notorious that it was clear were being ousted. Since there is a disagreement between you two, and there was an arguement you are likley to prevail on an ousting claim. This means that you may recover the fair market value of the rent that the property could be making. Overall, I believe that you have a strong case for being ousted and recovering some money from that, you also may sell your portion of the land if the court grants a partition in-kind, or you could sell your portion of the land on your own because you possess a fractional share of the property as a tenant in common. Dear Carl, Thank you for contacting me regarding your right to property in the gold coins, and how you may recover for your growler and coat. I have explained some options that you have below, please contact me for further clarification on any of the issues. The first issue is whehter you have a right to property in the gold coins. This issue deals with found property and there are types of found property listed as follows: lost; abandoned; mislaid; and treasure trove. Since you found the gold coins and they have an element of antiquity (coins from 1800s) they could be classified as treasure trove property. This means that you as the finder would have the Thank you for contacting me regarding your right to property in the gold coins, and how you may recover for your growler and coat. I have explained some options that you have below, please contact me for further clarification on any of the issues. The first issue is whehter you have a right to property in the gold coins. This issue deals with found property and there are types of found property listed as follows: lost; abandoned; mislaid; and treasure trove. Since you found the gold coins and they have an element of antiquity (coins from 1800s) they could be classified as treasure trove property. This means that you as the finder would have the property rights to the coins, unless the true owner can be ascertained. The bag of coins has the name of a local grocery store chain on them and becasue of this you would need to make an effort to find the owner as it appears they may be it. If you cannot ascertain the owner of the coins you may keep them. The only issue here is that some courts are reluctant to recognize treasure trove property as they say that it encourages trespass and bad behavior from finders looking for treasure (Corliss). Another issue is a precedent from Corliss which ruled that personal property found embedded in the soil is the legal possession of the land owner. While the coins that you found were not exactly found in the soil, they were found on the property of a land owner. This means that the precedent may apply, giving possessions of the coins to the brewery owner. You may argue that the precedent does not apply becasue the coins were not actually found in the soil, but this does not appear to be a strong arguement because they were still found benieth the floor boards. The coins are not likely to be qualified as mislaid, lost, or abandoned property becasue it appears that they were intentionally concealed. Overall, you are may receive the coins possession as treasure trove property, but in light of the above mentioned proecedent it is unlikely that a court would rule in your favor and the coins are more likely to go to the owner of the property. The next issue is whether you can recover for your growler. It appears that a bailment may have been created when you gave the brewery your growler and received a ticket from the brewery. In Allen the court ruled that a bailment was created when the car owner parked his car in the garage for custody and safe keeping, there was limited access to the garage, and the partron needed to present a ticket to the attendant in order to leave the premises. In your case these same elements are present as well. You gave your growler to the brewery for safe keeping, there was limited access to the growler, and you had to present a ticket in order to receive your growler back. Although your case is not exactly the same as the car garage case I believe you are likely to be successful in a claim againt the brewery because of your sentimental connection with the growler and becasue you meet the above mentioned elements for a and custody, and they were responsible for the bailmet. The brewery took your growler for safe keeping care of it. your growler to the brewery for safe keeping, there was limited access to the growler, and you had to present a ticket in order to receive your growler back. Although your case is not exactly the same as the car garage case I believe you are likely to be successful in a claim againt the brewery because of your sentimental connection with the growler and becasue you meet the above mentioned elements for a bailmet. The brewery took your growler for safe keeping and custody, and they were responsible for the care of it. As for the coat, this appears to be an issue of mislaid property. You intentionally placed the jacket on a coat rack and then overlooked or maybe someone else had taken it. It is possible that the coat is also lost property and you do not rememebr exactly where you had placed it. If the coat were mislaid then the store owner has a duty to find you and return the coat, this is seen in the McAvoy case, where a customer found a pocket book but the court ruled that the pocket book belonged to the store, after the rightful owner, not the finder. The coat is first yours and then it is the property of the store where it was found. If the coat was lost then the coat is still yours, but it would be the property of a subsequent finder next. Someone may have mistaken the coat for their own and taken it accidentily. If this was the case and they realize their mistake they are obligated to try to find the rightful owner, but if they cannot find you within 12 months, the lost property becomes their own. In conclusion, your coat could be classified as both mislad and lost property but not abandoned becasue you did not intentionally relinquish title to it. Your coat would be likely to be classifed as mislaid property because you said that you intentionally placed it on the coat rack and then it was not there. Therefore the coat belongs to you, and then to the store, if you are not ascertainable. The first issue is what interest Alex conveyed to David and if there is any recovery available to Alex. The conveyance to David gives him a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, and Fred and Frank have an executory interest. The interest to David is a fee simple subject to executory limitation becasue the interest is not going back to the grantor if the condition is broken, since it is going to a third party it is classifed as a fee simple subject to an executory limitation. While David's interest is not subject to the rule against perpetuities, Fred and Frank's interest is becasue they received an executory interest. Fred and Frank's interest would be void under the rule becasue the condition is if it is ever used for non- The first issue is what interest Alex conveyed to David and if there is any recovery available to Alex. The conveyance to David gives him a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, and Fred and Frank have an executory interest. The interest to David is a fee simple subject to executory limitation becasue the interest is not going back to the grantor if the condition is broken, since it is going to a third party it is classifed as a fee simple subject to an executory limitation. While David's interest is not subject to the rule against perpetuities, Fred and Frank's interest is becasue they received an executory interest. Fred and Frank's interest would be void under the rule becasue the condition is if it is ever used for non- residential use. This could happen well after the 21 year period that is allowed under the rule after the grantor dies. David could chose to use the property for non-residential use 40 years from now, and therefore we would not know if Fred and Frank's interest vests or fails within the period. Becasue of this the conveyance would need to be rewritten to exclude Fred and Frank's interest as follows, ""To David, so long as the property is used for residential use only,"" this would mean that the childrens interest is void and now David's interest would be classified as a fee simple determinable becasue of the words of duration in the grant ""so long as,"" this also means that Alex, as the grantor would have a possibility of reverter in the interest becasuse it is no longer going to a third party on violation. This means that when the condition is violated, the property would automatically be given back to the Grantor, Alex. Therefore, Alex will get the 5 acres he granted to David back when David violates the above condition. The next issue is what interest Alex conveyed to Edward. Alex's grant seems to have some ambiguity and this is becasue he uses the words of duration ""so long as"" indicating that he would like the interest to be a fee simple determinable. He also uses the words ""right to re-enter"" indicating that he prefers a right of entry, which would indicate a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (""FSSCS""). In cases where a conveyance is ambuguous the courts are more likely to grant the FSSCS becasue it is less likely that a receipent would lose the interest since the grantor is not automatically given the property back and they must bring action to get the property back. This means that the courts will likey classify the interest as a FSSCS and a right of rentry, meaning that if Alex wishes to receive his property back, he will need to bring an action to court on the issue. It seems as though Edward is directly violating the conveyance so Alex may be successful in his claim. "," The first issue is what claims Betty has to the property. Betty and Andrew own the property as tenants by the entirety meaning that they each own an undivided whole of the property, and this is only available to married persons with rights of survivorship. They have the right to use, exclude and recieve rental income. The interest can be severed by divorce or through agreement, but since that is not present here, there is no severence of that nature. Andrew had no right to sell the property to Chris and because of this Chris received a faulty title, which in turn so did Debbie. The second issue is what interest in the property Debbie obtained. Debbie obtained a faulty title but could adversly possess the property through color of title. Six elements of adverse possession must be satisfied, the possession must be: actual, open and notorious (Marengo Cave); continuous; exclusive; hostile; and meet the stautory requirement (10 years). Although Debbie herself did not possess the land for 10 years, she may tack on her predecessor Chris's possession since the property was transfered to her in privty (Tieu), which means by a voluntary transfer and not through forclosure. Chris possessed the property for eight years and it seems that his possession meets the adverse possession criteria. Even though he did only use the cabin for eight weeks of the year this would not violate the continuous element because he was using this as a vacation home or retreat and that is a reasonable useage for this type of home. He used it as any other owner would. The exclusive requirement would also be satisfied even though he allowed others to hunt and fish on the property becasue they did so with his permision, and if you have permission of the owner, you cannot have hostile possession. Since Debbie moved to the property full time and continued on until 2019 she may tack on her father's eight year possession, meaning that she would now have 16 years of possession, making it likely that she would be successful in asserting a color of title claim. It is unclear if Debbie used the property for the two years after her father died, but if she did use it, even just occasionally as a vacation destination, she could pass the continuous requirement for adverse possession. Betty will argue that Debbie did not continuously possess the land because she only moved there in 2011, while the facts are not clear on this issue, Betty may have a valid arguement if Debbie did not vistit the property for the full two years. Debbie allowing her neighbors to use the property as they wish means that she will probably only be able to claim possession of the two acres in use. She may be able to also claim the whole land portion though becasue the true owners were not on the premises using the land, and when this happens, the possessor may claim the whole land. Debbie seems to satisfy all elements of adverse possession. She has actual possession of the land and is on the premesis. Her possession is open and notorious, as continuously possess the land because she only moved there in 2011, while the facts are not clear on this issue, Betty may have a valid arguement if Debbie did not vistit the property for the full two years. Debbie allowing her neighbors to use the property as they wish means that she will probably only be able to claim possession of the two acres in use. She may be able to also claim the whole land portion though becasue the true owners were not on the premises using the land, and when this happens, the possessor may claim the whole land. Debbie seems to satisfy all elements of adverse possession. She has actual possession of the land and is on the premesis. Her possession is open and notorious, as Betty has seen that she is living there, in Marengo Cave the court held that all elements of adverse possession (""AP"") must be met, and if there was no open and notorious possession there could not be AP claim. She is has continuous possession becasue she is living there as a true owner would. She also has exclusive possession because she is using the two acres as a true owner would. Betty will make the arguement that Debbie is not making exclusive possession of the whole 50 acres becasue she allows other hunters to go on the land without her permission and is only using the two acres which she occupies. This is a convincing arguement, especially because if one element of AP fails then the whole claim does. She does meet the hostie requirement as well because she does not have permission from the true owner. That being said Debbie does have a valid AP claim to the two acres of land that she is using becasue she does meet all of the above mentioned AP requirements for that land. She has exclusive possession because she no one is allowed to enter her property without her permission, unlike the other 48 acres. In conclusion, Debbie would probably be successful in asserting a color of title AP claim for the two acres of land that she is using, and Betty would receive the remaining 48 acres that is not in use.

219be98b-3fc1-4977-9f0e-71d47af28886," The future interests and present estates of question one are as follows: Currently Oliver's children, Conner and Carla have a conditon subsequent. Robert has a contingent remainder subject to open in fee simple interest Victor has an executory interest, Vivian has an executory interest with condition subsequent. Oliver has a reversion in fee simple. Oliver's children have a condition subsequent because they need to retire in order to be granted the property, whoever the first to retire would then have a life estate. This would give Robert a vested remainder in fee simple, The grandchildren's interests would stay the same. Robert has a contingent remainder due to the fact that both Conner and Carla could work until they die, or both die before they decide to retire. For this same reason the rule against perpetuities voids this interest. Victor has an executory interest which always comes after a contingent remainder, also he is 26 which satisfies the lanuage of needing to be 25. and Vivian has a condition subsequent, because she is only 17 years old. The rule of perpetuities voids these interests in the fact that Conner and Carla may never retire. It is also void in the fact that there are only 2 grandchildren alive right now and one is 17. We are unaware if more grandchildren may be born or If Vivian will ever reach 25 years old. Correct lanuage that does not violate RAP would be: to my children for life, then to my nephew, then to my grandchildren above the age of 25. "," Essay 1: 1a. When brock comes into my law office to discuss if there are any steps he can take to make money from the developer i would tell him the folllowing. When Alex asked Brock to come on board and pay half the sum of the money and the business, Alex signed a deed that made them tenants in common. As tenants in common in this particular interest it is split half and half. The first thing I would advise Brock to do is to try to convince Alex to sell him the other half of the interest. This would give brock sole control owner of the brewery and the land. However it seems that Alex is very unlikely to do this based on the fact that he loves this brewery so much. As a tenant in common the common law states he has every interest and right to do what he wants with the property so long as it does not cause injury to the other tenants in common. In this case you can make the argument that Alex is causing Brock harm due to the fact that the offer being made by the developer is so good and high not to take it would cause a harm to Brocks interest in the property. It would be difficult to make a waste argument due to the fact that it isnt a specific modification to the property that is causing it to lose value, this particular incident is just causing Brock to lose money by not accepting the offer. On the contrary you could argue the same way for Alex alex loves this brewery and focing him to sell it would cause great emotional distress to him. While not a monatary injury this is still an injury. However I would still advise Brock to bring suit against Alex due to the fact that Alex is restricting his rights as a Tenant in common. 1b. I would tell Carl the folowing: In relation to the gold coins carl would likely not be able to keep them. The gold coins were found on the property of the brewery when an item is buried in the soil on somebodys property it is characterized as abandoned and common law states it belongs to the owner of the property above the finder, true owner and everyone else. The reason being it is presumed to be down there so long that it would be unreasonable to think that anyone would go back and get them. New Suffolk which follows common law in the U.S does not have a treasure trove so that claim would be irellevant. A competing interest for the coins to Alex and Brock would be the previous grocery store because it had their label on the coins and this was once their property. However once they sold the parcel of land the coins went with it, even so 10 years is a reasonable legnth of time the believe these coins were abandoned and noone is coming back for them. As far as Carl's growler he may have a bailment claim against the bartender. In Allen v Hyatt we see the common law doctrine adopted when a man dropped off his car in a parking garage unreasonable to think that anyone would go back and get them. New Suffolk which follows common law in the U.S does not have a treasure trove so that claim would be irellevant. A competing interest for the coins to Alex and Brock would be the previous grocery store because it had their label on coins the and this was once their property. However once they sold the parcel of land the coins went with it, even so 10 years is a reasonable legnth of time the believe these coins were abandoned and noone is coming back for them. As far as Carl's growler he may have a bailment claim against the bartender. In Allen v Hyatt we see the common law doctrine adopted when a man dropped off his car in a parking garage handed over his keys, and his car was then damaged. In the parking garage it was heavily secured and there was a man working the check in area. The court held there was reasonable belief that his car would be protected and not damaged therefore the parking garage was liable to the damages. Just like in the Allen case Carl handed over the growler to an employee reasonably expected it to be filled and brought back to him in tact. However the court in Allen also made the point that if this had been an open with no security its unreasonable to think the owner of the lot should be liable for damages as accidents happen all the time. Similarly Carl should have thought it wasnt so unlikely that a busy employee filling up a growler should be liable as resturant workers drop plates and glasses all the time. In regards to his coat you can make the argument that it is mislaid and not lost due to the fact that he believed to have placed it on one of the hooks. Mislaid property is the property owners until the true owner comes back to claim it. It could have been claimed as lost if it had somehow slipped off without him noticing and was laying on the floor. However that does not seem to be the case. You can also make the counterpoint that the coat was abandonded because on the way out he said forget it and seemed to remember the coat and know it was there and walked out on his own. In that case it would go to the person who found the coat. It was not buried in the soil or put in the wall so unlike the coins it would not go to the property owner if abanodoned on the property. 1c. Original: Alex life estate 5 vacant acres: David the developer has a life estate with subject to executory limitation frank and fred have a contingent remainder Other 5 acres: Edward has a life estate with condition subsequent his heirs have a contingent remaindner Alex has a reversion in fee simple The 5 acres of land will now go to Alex's two sons the deed stated that if it was ever used for non David the developer has a life estate with subject to executory limitation frank and fred have a contingent remainder Other 5 acres: Edward has a life estate with condition subsequent his heirs have a contingent remaindner Alex has a reversion in fee simple The 5 acres of land will now go to Alex's two sons the deed stated that if it was ever used for non residential purposes david will lose title, due to the fact that he built commercial stores. However in the case of Edward Alex may not have as strong of a claim. Even though there is a condition subsequent to not make IPA the condition is causing Edward monatary injury. Edward has operated the business and sales have been poor a court is likely to rule in Edwards favor due to the injury he is suffering. However in the developers case he has not yet built the building. There is no sufficent evidence that building only a residence and no commercial stores will cause damage, he must build and try first or pass it to Alexs sons. If there is evidence not building the commercial stores will cause damage he can then bring up a claim against Alex saying the condition subsequent is causing him injury. "," Debbie would likely make a claim for adverse possesion against Betty inorder to claim the property. In order for adverse possesion to be satisfied the use of the land must be actual, open and notorious, hostile and consecutive In this case Betty could make a claim that there is no adverse posession due to the fact that when Chris bought the land from Andrew his use of the land wasnt continous. He only visited the land 8 weeks out of the year, and spent limited time on it. However on the contrary you can make the point that his use of the land was in fact continous, due to the fact that this was only a vacation home and he continously used it and visited for his fishing trips. In the case that a court rules Chris use not continous Debbie will not have a claim of adverse possesion against Betty due to the fact that she only lived on the land full time for 8 years when the statute of limitations is 10. However due to the fact that Bettys signature was forged she would likely sue for a tort. However due to the fact that Andrew is no longer alive she can not sue for fraud becuase the purchase by chris was out of good faith. If a trial court ruled in favor of betty not granting debbie adverse posession Debbie could make a claim of color title to the land giving her the 2 acres she was using and Betty the other 48. Under color title she is not allowed to ask for anymore of the property she was using. Due to the fact that the title she had was defective if she does not get an adverse possesion claim this would be her best route to go. It seems all other claims of adverse possesion are satisfied so long as a court rules in favor that chris the fact that Bettys signature was forged she would likely sue for a tort. However due to the fact that Andrew is no longer alive she can not sue for fraud becuase the purchase by chris was out of good faith. If a trial court ruled in favor of betty not granting debbie adverse posession Debbie could make a claim of color title to the land giving her the 2 acres she was using and Betty the other 48.

Due to the fact that the title she had was defective if she does not get an adverse possesion claim this would be her best route to go. It seems all other claims of adverse possesion are satisfied so long as a court rules in favor that chris use of the land was continous. He had physical posession of the land, he used the land as if it was his his intent was in good faith, however the minority rule on this is intent does not matter, and he used the land as if it was his own.

In this scenario, Oliver is alive as are his two children Connor and Carla. Connor and Carla each have a contingent remainder subject to complete divestment in a life estate- the property will go to whoever retires first for their lifetime but both could die before they retire in which case it would go to Robert. Robert has an executory interest in a life estate. Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple and Vivian has a contingent remainder subject to open and subject to complete divestment. Under the Rule of Perpetiuites, the last clause ""then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25. This is because Oliver could die, then his children and Robert could die tomorrow with a child who is 1 years old at the time of all of the life in being's death. That child would not turn 25 within 21 years after any of the lives in being and therefore that interest is void under the rule of perpetuities. This could be saved, however, if the court applies the rule of convience to Victor's interest because he has satisfied the requirements and they close the class. Then that interest is valid. Oliver's grant could also be written as ""to the first of my children to retire for life, then to my newphew Robert for life."" This would leave Oliver's estate with a reversion after the death of Robert. "," 1a. The issue here is what rights Brock has with regards his tenancy in common with his brother Alex. While the deed that Alex signed states that Brock and himelf are to hold the land ""jointly as tenants in common."" The type of concurrent interest they have is as tenants in common - not as joint tenants. Although the deed says ""jointly"" this is not enough to create joint tenants as there is no explicit mention of the right of survivorship. For this reason, their concurrent interests would be considered tenants in common. In a tenancy in common, Alex and Brock share an undivided interest in use of the property but can have 1a. The issue here is what rights Brock has with regards his tenancy in common with his brother Alex. While the deed that Alex signed states that Brock and himelf are to hold the land ""jointly as tenants in common."" The type of concurrent interest they have is as tenants in common - not as joint tenants. Although the deed says ""jointly"" this is not enough to create joint tenants as there is no explicit mention of the right of survivorship. For this reason, their concurrent interests would be considered tenants in common. In a tenancy in common, Alex and Brock share an undivided interest in use of the property but can have fractional economic interests. Tenancies in common can be unilaterally severed - and Brock could sell his individual interest in the property. There are a few options here that Brock could consider with regards to selling his share. Because Brock owns a share of the company, he can sell his interest to the real estate developer. The real estate developer probably does not want this, because he wants to purchase both the warehouse and the land around it develop the condos. This sale would likely not go over well with Alex who does not want to sell at all. It is likely that the court here with grand a partition by kind, like in Delfino v. Valencis. If they were to divide up the interests by a partition in kind, the court would move to install a physical border separating Alex's property from Brock's. As Alex has the most interest in the Warehouse where the brewery is, it's possible that by a partion in kind Alex could argue to keep his warehouse - that which is of the most sentimental and monetary value to him. This, like in Delfino, would likely be a winning argument to the court because there is strong persuasion in the sentimental value and investment. Brock could take the surrounding ten acres - perhaps not very valuable at the moment as there is nothing there. These acres are not part of Alex's business and likely are of lesser value to him than the brewery is. Brock could then sell those ten acres to the developer to build his condos and reap the benefits. Although the sale would be less than if the developer paid $2 mill for the entire property - Brock could still reap significant economic benefit from selling his interest to the developer if that is his goal. Brock however, may have to pay an owely to Alex from that money, as Alex's fractional share is likely larger than Brock's. In a partition by sale, the entire property including the warehouse would be sold and the money would be divided up between Alex and Brock. It's likely that Alex would have a larger fractional share of the proceeds because he established the brewery and is the most invested in with regards to both time and money. This does not particularly benefit Brock - since he could make more money by selling his shares to the developer then if they sold the entire property as he would not have to share it with Alex. Alex's main interest is also in the sentimental value with regards to the brewery and he would not likely be in In a partition by sale, the entire property including the warehouse would be sold and the money would be divided up between Alex and Brock.

This does not particularly benefit Brock - since he could make more money by selling his shares to the developer then if they sold the entire property as he would not have to share it with Alex. Alex's main interest is also in the sentimental value with regards to the brewery and he would not likely be in favor of a parition by sale because he does not care as much about the money. It's likely that in order to divide their tenancy in common interests, the court would grant a parition in kind in which Alex would be able to keep the brewery and operate it as he has the most attachment to it. Brock could then sell the remaining ten acres to the developer and reap the proceeds for himself. Alex and the developer would then become tenants in common. 1b. Carl - The first issue here is whether or not you have any claim to the gold coins that you found under the base floor of the warehouse. There are different categories for this kind of property. It is either going to be considered abandoned, mislaid, lost, or treasure trove. In order to keep the gold coins carl maywant to try to argue that this property is either lost, treasure trove, or abandoned. If it is lost, and Carl is the finder, then the gold coins belong first and foremost to the original owner of them, and after that to Carl who is the first finder. This may be problematic for Carl in the future if the orginal owner comes back for them, as they have a superior claim to them and can sue Carol for the value in which case he would lose the the original finder. If Carl argues that the gold coins should be considered treasure trove, then they would belong again first and foremost to the original owner and then to Carl because he is the finder. This again would be an issue for Carl because if the original owner came back they would have a suprerior claim over Carl and could sue him for the value. Many courts also do not recognize the category of treasure trove because treasure trove encourages trespass onto another's property to look for items of value. Even though the coins are old, because the bag they were found in have the name of a local grocery store on them that is currently open - it is likely that the original owner did not lose them too long ago and there is a strong change they will come back for them. It's also possible the coins could have been lost as long as 10 years ago and if it was 10 years it's less likely the true owner would come back for them, however, 10 years is not that if the original owner came back they would have a suprerior claim over Carl and could sue him for the value. Many courts also do not recognize the category of treasure trove because treasure trove encourages trespass onto another's property to look for items of value. Even though the coins are old, because the bag they were found in have the name of a local grocery store on them that is currently open - it is likely that the original owner did not lose them too long ago and there is a strong change they will come back for them. It's also possible the coins could have been lost as long as 10 years ago and if it was 10 years it's less likely the true owner would come back for them, however, 10 years is not that long and it is very possible. This would likely make both of these categories a losing argument for Carl. His strongest argument would be that the coins were abandoned. It seems intentional that the owner left them under the baseboard of the brewery and left them there. In this case, the coins would go to the finder even if the original owner came back for them. If the court were to buy Carl's argument for abandoned, he would always retain the superior claim. However, concealing valuable items under a floor is not likely going to sound like a traditionally abandoned item to the court and they may not buy Carl's argument. It is also likely that the owner of the brewery could come forward and make an argument that the coins were mislaid by the original owner. In that case, the coins would go to the owner of the premises on which the coins were found, not to the finder (Linder Aviation). This would be similar to the case where someone's bag was found in a barbershop and the court found that the owner of the premises had superior claim of title to it, after the true owner. This would cut Carl's claim out entirely. The facts here, are different, however, because gold coins in a bag under the floorboards seems more intentional than simply leaving a bag in a barbershop and the court would not likely agree with the brewery that it was mislaid. The brewery could, however, invoke Corliss v. Wenner and argue the additional category of embedded property, where the property would first go to the true owner and then to the owner of the presmises. It is possible that the court would buy this argument - but many courts do not recognize this category. Unforunately, it is unlikely that you, Carl, have any real claim to the gold coins that the court will recognize. With regards to both the growler and the coat, the issue is whether or not a bailment relationship was created here. In a bailment relationship, there is a presumption or explicit 10 agreement that the bailee is responsible for the items. This responsibility may be created by an explicit agreement or the circumstances surrounding the bailment (Allen v. Hyatt). recognize. With regards to both the growler and the coat, the issue is whether or not a bailment relationship was created here. In a bailment relationship, there is a presumption or explicit agreement that the bailee is responsible for the items. This responsibility may be created by an explicit agreement or the circumstances surrounding the bailment (Allen v. Hyatt). Here, Carl gave his growler to the bartender. The bartender then gave him a ticket with a number on it and attached a tag with the same number to Carl's growler. The growley was of great sentimental value to Carl, even if it was not of great monetary value. Under Allen v. Hyatt, Carl would want to argue that the surrounding circumstances created a bailment with the bartender in which the bartender was a bailee with regards to his growler. By giving the barteder the growler and attaching a number to the growler and carl's caim ticket, the bartender has a duty of care to be responsible for the mug and return it back to him in the same condition. This is like the parking garage in the Hyatt case where the car owner parked his car and was given a ticket, then with that ticket he could leave with his car and there was a presumption of a duty of care while he was away. The ticket is a circumstance that can create the bailment as Carl took the ticket thinking it would be in the bartender's care and that it would be returned in the same condition he left it. There are some notable differences here, however. The growler is not of as much monetary value as the car. The growler is also at a busy bar with lots of patrons and nobody monitoring it like the parking garage in Hyatt which had valuable cars that were monitored by the security guards. There is a higher chance of it being taken here and fewer circumstances (no guards or security) that would create a bailment realtionship like in Hyatt. Furthermore, the dissent in Hyatt emphasizes that bailments should be created through explicit language. The bartender and Carl never explicitly entered into a bailment realtionship, and if Carl tried to claim a bailment realtionship the bartender could invoke the dissent that there was never an agreement of any kind, nor were the circumstances enough to presume a duty of care by the bartender. It is unlikely that a court would find that a bailment relationship was created between Carl and the bartender and Carl likely has no claim with regards to the broken growler. Carl's claim for his coat is even less - he simply left it on a hook. it was not a coat check situation where he was given a ticket in exchange for his coat. It was simply left on a hook in a public area with other hooks. Because of this, there was certainly no bailment relationship created and there is nothing in the facts that suggest Carl could argue there was any kind of bailment created in regards to his jacket.

In David's first deed, he gives David a fee simple subject determinable followed by an executory interest in his sons Frank and Fred. Here this is created by the language ""so long as the proeprty is used for residential uses only...if it is ever used for non residential uses..to Frank and fred."" The moment that David stops using the property for residential purposes, Frank and Fred can cut short David's interest. As David has planned to build a development with gound floor commercial stores, this would violate the conditions of his deed and Frank and Fred's interest would cut David's fee simple short. Frank and Fred would then each have a fee simple as tenants in common. The facts here suggest that David has only made plans to build these commercial stores and has not actually executed this plan. As long as they remain plans, I do not believe Frank and Fred could cut his interest short yet. The moment he begins to use the property for commercial purposes, such as if he opened a store, then Frank and Fred's interests would automatically take hold and they would have present interests in the property. But until he actually begins to use them for something besides residental purposes, Frank and Fred's interest cannot take hold. In David's second deed, he gives Edward the other five acres in fee simple. What kind of fee simple he created, however, is slightly ambiguous. This is because he used the language typically of a fee simple determinable ""so long as"" followed by the language of a Right of Re- Entry ""if IPAs are ever made on the premises Alex has the right to reenter and reclaim the premises."" A fee simple determinable is typically followed by a possibility of reverter. If the court were to find the deed to be a fee siple determinable, then as soon as Edward made IPA's on the premises, the interest would atuomatically go back to Alex. It is likely here that the court would find this language to be a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and that Alex would have to exercise his right of re-entry to claim the premises back from Edward when he starts making IPAs on the property. the premises Alex has the right to reenter and reclaim the premises."" A fee simple determinable is typically followed by a possibility of reverter. If the court were to find the deed to be a fee siple determinable, then as soon as Edward made IPA's on the premises, the interest would atuomatically go back to Alex. It is likely here that the court would find this language to be a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and that Alex would have to exercise his right of re-entry to claim the premises back from Edward when he starts making IPAs on the property. In Marenholz, the court analyzed a similarly ambiguous will. In Marenholz, the court held that it created a fee simple determinable because of the language of duration. Modern courts prefer, however, prefer the fee simple subject to conditionsubsequent with the right of reverter because it limits deadhand control on property. Because in Alex's deed it explicitly states that Alex has a right of re-entry, a modern court would likely found that a fee simple subject condition subsequent was created and that Alex could exercise his right of re-entry and claim the property because Edward starting making IPA's on the property. Alex would then have a fee simple. "," The first issue here is whether Betty has a claim to Greenacre or not. Andrew and Betty were tenants by entirety - which means they were married and that their interests were subject to the right of survivorship. In a tenancy by entirety, when one spouse dies, their interests disappear and the surviving spouse gets all of their interests. This means that any interest Andrew had while he was living disappears- if he had left any of his property in a will it would not go those to whom he devised it but rather to the surviving tenant in is tenancy by entirety, Betty. The only ways a joint tenancy can be severed is through a prior agreement, death, or divorce. In this case, Betty is the surviving spouse in the tenancy by entirety and she gets all of Andrews interests. Betty would argue that although andrew sold Greenacre to Chris, when Andrew died, she took over all of his interests and therefore had a claim to Greenacre regardless of whether or not he had ever been there. They did not divorce and she did not agree to the sale of Greenacre with Andrew. As a tenant by entirety, Andrew could not unilaterally sell this property and he did so by forging Betty's signature - she did not actually agree to it. Betty would argue that because of this Debbie's claim to Greenacre is invalid and it should be returned to her as she has legal title to it. Debbie, however, also has several strong arguments to establish her legal claim to Greenacre. Debbie could argue that she has a claim to Blackacre through adverse possession. tenant by entirety, Andrew could not unilaterally sell this property and he did so by forging Betty's signature - she did not actually agree to it. Betty would argue that because of this Debbie's claim to Greenacre is invalid and it should be returned to her as she has legal title to it. Debbie, however, also has several strong arguments to establish her legal claim to Greenacre. Debbie could argue that she has a claim to Blackacre through adverse possession. In order to establish adverse possession Debbie would have to fulfill the statute of limitations and establish that her use was hostile, actual, continuous, exclusive, and open and notorious (Pimental). Debbie's family came into possession of Blackacre in 2001. The statute of limitations for adverse possession in New Suffolk is 10 years. Her father occupied the cabin just as Andrew did - as a vacation home for about 8 years. After this, Debbie inherited the property and used it as her home for the following 11 years. Debbie could tack on her father's 8 years to her 11 because she obtained them through privity - legal transfer from her father (Tieu v. Morgan). The tacking, hoever, is not even necessary because Debbie herself occupied the property for 11 years - exceeding the statute of limitations. Debbie would argue that her use was hostile because she was occuping the premises without the permission of the true owner - Betty. She would then argue that her use was actual because she was actually living on the land and present there for equivalent time that the true owner also would be. She would then argue that her use was continuous because she lived there year round - even if she just used it as a vacation home her use would be continuous because that was how Andrew used it but it goes even beyond that. She would then argue that her use was exclusive because she solely occupied the premises and anyone else who was there was acting with her permission to be there - like a true owner would. She would argue that her use was open and notorious because it was clear that she was living there - she built a large year round house, and cleared the trees and built a formal garde, and because of this Betty should have been on notice that Debbie was living there as she could have come up to Greenacre and discovered this at any time over the past 11 years. Betty would rebutt the argument of adverse possession and to defeat it she would only have to disprove one of the elements. She would argue that using the objective standard from Morrow v. Cahill, Debbie did not believe that she had a superior claim of right to the property because she believed she was acting with Andrew's permisison to be there - as he had sold her family the property and in that way he v. Cahilll, it is unclear if a court would buy this gave them the permission to be there. Just as in Morrow argument - but it is possible that this could defeat Debbie's entire claim to adverse possession because she did not objectively believe that she had the superior title to the land.

Betty may also try to argue that Debbie's use was not exclusive, because she allowed her neighbors to hunt on her property - however, a court would not likely buy this argument because the neighbors were acting with Debbie's permission. Debbie may also argue that she was operating under color of title. This is because when Andrew sold greenacre to Chris, the deed was invalid due to the forged signature. But because Debbie's family believed it was valid, they would still have a claim to Greenacre as they were operating as if it was valid. Through color of title, Debbie would have claim to all of the land of Greenacre. This one may be a difficult one for the court to decide. They sale of Greenacre does have both tenat's signature and does not seem at face value to be unilateral. However, Betty's argument that it was forged and therefore unilateral and invalid could be quite convincing to the court. Although Betty may have a claim to Greenacre because her and Andrew were tenants by entirety and this could not be severed when Andrew sold his interest to Chris, it is likely that the court would find that since then, because Debbie has satisfied the statute of limitations and the requirements for adverse possesion, she now has legal title to Greenacre.

4b049ce9-ee16-4711-93e7-eeea86d405da," Connor and Carla have future interest in a life estate with a conditional remainder being that the first one of them to retire will be granted the interest. Robert has a remainder in a life estate. Victor and Vivian have a fee simple subject to executory limitations, which are reaching the age of 25. Since Victor has already reached the age of 25 the interest can be granted to him fully after both life estates under the rules of convenience. Connor and Carla's interest is subject under the Rules against Perpetuities because it is a life estate with a contingent remainder. Robert's is not. Victor and Vivian's are also subject because of the subject to executory limitations. Connor and Carla's interest doesn't violate the rules against perpetuities because the first one to retire will be known in their lifetimes. Victor and Vivian's interest is subject to the rule against perpetuities, but since Victor has already satisfied the vesting requirement, Vivian doesn't need to and the entirety can be given to Victor if she is unsuccessful in doing so. "," 1A. Dear Brock, The question you are asking is, if it is possible for you to sell your shares of the property as a tenant in common? The courts generally say, as a tenant in common the land can be divided by partition or by sale. The language in the deed that grants the land to both brothers is wording that makes the division seem 50/50 for each brother. If you wanted to make money off of the portion you own you Alex, does not seem fond on the idea of selling, would likely have to take this to court as you brother, even though the asking price is more than the property is worth. That being said, the court has the option to take the entirety of the property and put it up for sale or to divide the land in half and allow tenant in common? The courts generally say, as a tenant in common the land can be divided by partition or by sale. The language in the deed that grants the land to both brothers is wording that makes the division seem 50/50 for each brother. If you wanted to make money off of the portion you own you would likely have to take this to court as you brother, Alex, does not seem fond on the idea of selling, even though the asking price is more than the property is worth. That being said, the court has the option to take the entirety of the property and put it up for sale or to divide the land in half and allow each brother to do what they desire with their own halves. Typically, the court prefers to use a partition. Delfino v Vaelencis. As seen in the Delfino case, the owner of only 1/ the property, Vaelencis, was content to keep just that to run her trash business on, but had the court ruled for the sale of the property Vaelencis would not have been able to afford to purchase the entirety, but Delfino would have. The court also considered the deep ties that Vaelencis had to her portion of the land. Being that, it had been used for almost 60 years as a place to run a family business. To uproot this would be detrimental to her and her livelihood. Alex has clear ties to the land even though he has only been situated there and running the business for four years it is an up and coming neighborhood and the brewery is profitable. Although, the warehouse itself rests on 10 acres, of which the business does not operate from outside of the warehouse. With partitions, it can be difficult depending on where the resources are on the land and if dividing the land into the portions allocated would even be possible. Sometimes there is more value to one half of the land in contrast to the other. Whether that be water/power lines, or even the view of a skyline could be taken to make a potion of the land to be more valuable. These are all things that the courts will have to consider when it comes to determining which option will be most beneficial to both parties. Overall, the court is likely to conclude that a partition would be the best in this situation as long as it is doable on the land. Likely, you will be left with five acres that do not include the warehouse, tasting room and restaurant and your brother will keep fives acres that the warehouse is on. This is because it will avoid putting the entirety up for sale when you both have equal stakes in the land because of the deed. Once this is done, you will be free to use your land as you see fit, meaning selling it to the real estate company would be an option. Your brother would be able to maintain his business on his shares of the land. Thank you. deed. Once this is done, you will be free to use your land as you see fit, meaning selling it to the real estate company would be an option. Your brother would be able to maintain his business on his shares of the land. Thank you. 1. B. Dear Carl, The question is whether or not you have obtained a right to the coins you found within the brewery. Typically, those who find objects that seem to be misplaced, lost, or hidden have a right to property above anyone except the true owner. In your case, you found the coins on the property of the brewery owners and there was some sort of identification on them they established where they originated, the local grocery store. In prior situations of this nature, if something is left at a store, such as this, courts have ruled that it is the duty of the store owners to keep and try to find the owners of the lost item. This is because when someone loses something in a store they are likely to head back and ask workers about it and would be able to obtain it from them if it was handed in there. But, because the coins you have discovered seem to be much older in nature and predate the opening of the brewery the finders clause could aid in you keeping the coins. Similar to if a jewel was found by a worker in a chimney, the courts have ruled that the person who found the item has title to the object above all but the true owner. In the jewler case the appraiser tried to keep the jewel and the courts said this was not allowed. Since the coins seem to have been left for a long period of time without anyone coming to look for them, the courts would likely rule that you, Carl, are entitled to keep the coins and do with so as you please. This is because the coins predate the creation of the brewery, therefore, no customer will be coming back to look for them and the brewery did not find them so they do not have as strong of a right to them. Also, if the appraiser tries to keep the coins, there is already court rulings that would support your right to them over theirs. Carl, you have the highest right to the coins unless the true owner steps forward. Your other question is about if you have any rights when it comes to the broken growler and coming back to look for them and the brewery did not find them so they do not have as strong of a right to them. Also, if the appraiser tries to keep the coins, there is already court rulings that would support your right to them over theirs. Carl, you have the highest right to the coins unless the true owner steps forward. Your other question is about if you have any rights when it comes to the broken growler and missing coat comes down to if this exchange was a bailment? Typically, the rule is that when a person is trusting another with their property their is a bailment created between the two parties and thus responsibility is shifted for the time when the bailor gives the bailee possession of the items. In your case, you gave the growler to bar and asked the bartender to fill it, you were given a claim ticket to later be able to identify the growler to yourself. There have been similar instances of this where a person has parked a new car in a parking garage with only one entrance/exit and an attendant at the exit to collect the money and the car is stolen. The courts ruled that this was indeed a bailment and there was negligence on the part of the parking garage and thus the owner of the car was entitled to recover. Allen v. Hyatt. For your missing coat, you simply placed this on a public coat rack on your own accord with no person exchanging any type of responsibility with you. In this instance, youhave a claim for a bailment when it comes to the growler, but not the coat. Upon handing the bartender the growler and receiving the ticket you were giving the bartender the responsibility to keep the growler and then return it to you safely when you came back and matched the ticket to the number on the growler. Shifting the responsibility to keep it safe from yourself to the bar. As for the coat, simply hanging a coat in a public space is not passing the responsibility onto anyone else, but is leaving your item in a public space with the hopes that it will be there when you return. There was no responsibilty put on any other person/entity so you still maintained that when you left the coat, thus no bailment for the coat. Thank you. Thank you. 1C: Dear Alex, When you divided the property, the 5 acres that you conveyed to David were conveyed in fee simple with executory limitations. The limitations being that the property must be used for residential use only. When David began using the property for other purposes he lost his rights to use the property and then you sons Frank and Fred acquired it. Your sons aquired the land through executory interest which follows if the executory limitations are broken. As for the other 5 acres that you conveyed to Edward, you conveyed these in a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Meaning, that if Edward began to make IPAs on the premises you had a right of re-entry. That being said, you must assert your right of re-entry, the deed is not immediately conveyed back to you. That being said, one of your conveyances does fall under something called the Rules against Perpetuities, the one to David, since it became an executory interest. Therefore, we have to go through the rules and make sure that the conveyance didn't exceed a validating life plus 21 years. In your case, you did not violate the rules because the validating lives end upon the death of your sons meaning that it would not go 21 years past that. "," Debbie will make the argument that she has acquired the land through color of title and adverse possession. When her father, Chris, was purchasing the land he believed the deed to be valid. His use of the land was open and notorious. The neighbors new he was there and asked permission to use the land. Also, he expanded the home which others could plainly see him doing. His use was actual and continuous being that he was there for eight weeks out of the year. Betty may argue that eight weeks is not continuous, but courts decide continuous based on the type of land it was and would likely see eight weeks out of the year continuous in regard to a vacation home. Under the rules of adverse possession, Betty is likely to argue that the one part that Chris and Debbie do not satisfy is hostile. This is where the color of title comes in, since they believed they had acquired a valid deed. Debbie continues to use the land after it is given to her in the same manner as her father and even moves there full time. The statute of limitations is only ten years and so this has been satisfied by Chris and Debbie. Betty will argue that Chris only used the land for 8 years until his death and that Debbie has only been using the land for 8 as well. The courts will disagree with this because they will put together the two amounts of time as a whole and the statute of limitations will be satisifed. The courts only do this because Debbie acquired the property by a conveyance from her father who was already adversely possessing the property. Betty may argue that allowing guests to use the land invalidated adverse possession, but the court is likely to find that they maintained ownership of the property and simply allowed guests which is fine under the adverse possession laws. Especially since the neighbors were given restrictions on when and what they could do on the land. Betty is likely to argue that the sale in its entirety was not valid. This is because when it comes to tenants by the entirety one member cannot sell off a portions of the land without the permission of the other. This being what happened she will seek to recover the 50 acres. In trying to recover this, Debbie does have an adverse possession claim, but only to the 2 acres that her an her father used. The other 48 acres are not satisfied under adverse possession because neither her or her father ever used them. Thus, these would likely be returned to Betty. ",178,1707,446
6558fe69-19cf-4c1e-946e-ce09d858ec09," Before applying RAP: Oliver Owner has a Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation. Oliver Owner's grant gives the first of his children to retire a (Future) Executory Interest in a Life Estate. This interest is not a remainder because they are ready to take at retirement, and do not need to wait until the natural end of an interest. However, neither of his Oliver's children, Connor and Carla, have satisfied the condition necessary to take possession of the property (retirement) and thus their interest is not presently possessory. Oliver Owner's grant gives Robert a Contingent Remainder in a Life Estate. Robert's interest is a remainder because it waits for the natural end of the interest before it (that of Oliver's children) to become possessory. Oliver Owner's Grant gives Victor a Vested Remainder Subject to Open/Partial Divestment. Victor's future interest waits patiently for Robert's life to end, so it is a remainder, and it is Vested because, by reaching the age of 27, he does not need to do anything else to obtain his interest. Oliver Owner's grant gives Vivian and any grandchildren who reach the age of twenty-five a Contingent Remainder in Fee Simple. Their interest is a remainder because they wait patiently until the end of Robert's life to take possession. Vivian's interest is contingent because she has not yet reached the necessary age of twenty-five, and the rest of the grandchildren are still unascertained. Oliver Owner also maintains a Reversion in Fee Simple. After applying RAP: Only Contingent Remainders, Executory Interests, and Vested Remainders are subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities, so there is no need to examine Oliver Owner's present possessory interest in Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation or his Reversion. The Future Executory Interest in a Life Estate held by the first of Oliver Owner's children to retire is After applying RAP: Only Contingent Remainders, Executory Interests, and Vested Remainders are subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities, so there is no need to examine Oliver Owner's present possessory interest in Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation or his Reversion. The Future Executory Interest in a Life Estate held by the first of Oliver Owner's children to retire is subject to RAP. As Oliver Owner is still alive, he could still have more children (in addition to Connor and Carla) that may gain an executory interest upon birth. That means that upon his death, none of his children already in being may be retired (but we will know within their lives if they retire or not), AND any future children that Oliver may have may not be retired. Because their interest will not necessarily vest or fail within twenty-one years of a life in being (unborn children cannot be their own validating life) this interest IS VOID UNDER RAP. Robert's interest is also subject to RAP. However, Robert is a life in being at the time of the grant, and we will necessarily know within twenty-one years of his lifetime whether his interest vested or failed, making it VALID UNDER RAP. The interest to Robert's grandchildren, under the traditional application of RAP, would fail for the same reasons as Oliver's children: there may be as yet unascertained persons whose interest would not necessarily vest or fail within twenty-one years of a life in being. HOWEVER, because one of the class of grantees, Victor, has already reached the necessary age as stipulated in the grant, we can apply the RULE OF CONVENIENCE and close the class at the time the grant was given, vesting Victor and Vivian's interest and making them VALID UNDER RAP. Rewriting the grant after striking the offending interests would read: ""To my nephew Robert for life, then to my grandchildren (Victor or Vivian) who reach the age of 25."" 2) "," The issues at hand are Brock's rights as co-tenant with his brother, Alex. Brock and Alex's cotenancy, established when Brock bought an interest in Alex's property and was subsequently granted by Alex ""this land to my myself and my brother Brock to hold jointly as tenants in common."" Although this grant references ""jointly,"" it is not a joint tenancy, as joint tenancy requires the four unities: time, title, possession, and interest. Although both brothers have equal possession and share the interest from the same granting document, Alex's interest was aquired before Brock's, violating the time unity. (Harms v. Sprague) As cotenants, both brothers have a fractional ownership of the property (in this case 50/50) but have equal rights to possession and use. Cotenants are also allowed to convey their interest, which it seems like Brock wishes to do here. Brock has tried to get Alex to sell the property jointly, but Alex has clearly stated that he is invested in his property and his business and does not wish to sell. Brock, as cotenant, still has a right to sell his fractional interest through a partition action, either in kind or by sale. The courts usually favor partition in kind, which physically separates the property and creates separate interests in each of the cotenants, rather than a partition by sale, which requires the sale of the entire property and a splitting of the proceeds. The courts will favor a partition by sale if a partition in kind is impossible, impractical, or in the best interests of both parties. In this case, the court will likely consider Alex's personhood of property and the emotional ties he has with his land and thus favor a partition in kind. A partition in kind, however, can be difficult to execute because it requires splitting the property by value: in this case, Brock would be entitled to 50% of the value of the land, which now includes a thriving brewery, tasting room, and small restaurant, all of which Alex would presumably want to keep in his possession to continue to operate his business. If Brock were to initiate a partition action, and the court were to favor partition in kind, then the property would be split evenly (as they are each 50% fractional owners) and Brock would be free to sell his partitioned property. However, I might advise Brock that, instead of instituting a partition action, he may want to investigate keeping his cotenancy with his brother and exercising the rights he has as a cotenant with regard to the profits of their property. Cotenants are entitled to their fractional share of all profits that are generated by the property, and Brock can collect from Alex's thriving business. (Martin v. Martin) Although If Brock were to initiate a partition action, and the court were to favor partition in kind, then the property would be split evenly (as they are each 50% fractional owners) and Brock would be free to sell his partitioned property. However, I might advise Brock that, instead of instituting a partition action, he may want to investigate keeping his cotenancy with his brother and exercising the rights he has as a cotenant with regard to the profits of their property. Cotenants are entitled to their fractional share of all profits that are generated by the property, and Brock can collect from Alex's thriving business. (Martin v. Martin) Although Brock would also then be responsible for his fractional share of the carrying charges associated with the property (mortgages, necessary repairs, maintenance), if the brewery is thriving, Brock might be better off collecting from the business rather then selling. Brock also seems to be concerned about the long hours working at the brewery. Alex, in fact, oustered Brock by yelling, ""get out of here and don't come back"" because he kicked Brock out and established exclusive possession. Even though Brock has been oustered, he is still a cotenant and is still able to collect any fractional profits from his property. This may solve his issue of not wanting to work long hours at the brewery any longer, and he will still be able to potentially profit. Additionally, Brock did not indicate whether his brother lives on the property or not, but if he does, Brock can deduct the fair market value of Alex's rent from his carrying charges in any accounting action. (Where normally you wouldn't be able to collect any rent or value thereof from a cotenant, you can do so in an accounting action after you've been oustered.) If Brock were to initiate a partition action and the court instituted a partition in kind, Brock would be able to sell his partitioned property to the developers. However, for reasons just described, Brock may be able to stop working at the Brewery (which he does not like) and still exercise his right as cotenant to collect a profit, which may be more beneficial to him in the long run. <QUESTION id='Q1' tell=""Essay Question 1(b): ""> <![CDATA[ Carl, Thank you for reaching out to me regarding the gold coins you found, your coat, and your growler. In order to help you evaluate any rights/claims you may have to this property, we will need to evaluate a number of laws regarding your finder's rights to the gold coins and your bailment rights as to the growler and the coat. The law of finders states that a finder has a right to a thing good against all but the rightful owner. (Armory v. Delamirie) However, in this case we also need to consider laws regarding treasure trove or Thank you for reaching out to me regarding the gold coins you found, your coat, and your growler. In order to help you evaluate any rights/claims you may have to this property, we will need to evaluate a number of laws regarding your finder's rights to the gold coins and your bailment rights as to the growler and the coat. The law of finders states that a finder has a right to a thing good against all but the rightful owner. (Armory v. Delamirie) However, in this case we also need to consider laws regarding treasure trove or embedded property. Treasure trove law, which applies to valuable, antiquated property, states that the finder of a treasure trove has a right good against all but the rightful owner, and in most treasure trove cases, the rightful owner has long been dead, giving them a safely exclusive claim to the treasure. However, many states are moving away from treasure trove laws in favor of embedded property laws, which state that such finds are ""embedded"" in the property where they are found and as such go to the owner of the property instead of the finder. Here, your best argument would be to make a case for treasure trove: the coins you found were appraised to be from the late 1800's and worth around $20,000. This satisfies the basic requirements for treasure troves, old and valuable. If Bostonia has a treasure trove statute, this would be your best argument for the gold coins. Brock and Alex's brewery can also lay claim to the property using embedded property laws. If Bostonia does not have a treasure trove statute, then the courts would use embedded property and thus the coins would be deemed part of the property in which they were found, the brewery. (Corliss v. Wenner) If Bostonia's laws are anything like Massachusetts's laws regarding found property, you have a duty to report the coins to the police within two days, as they are valued at over $3. In order to determine your rights regarding your growler and your coat, we need to examine bailment laws. A bailment is created when temporary possession without title is transferred to a third person. This transfer creates a bailment as to whatever property was transferred, with you, the transferor as the bailor and the recipient as the bailee. Bailees have a reasonable duty of care as to the property in their possession. Here, you have a very strong argument for a bailment relationship between you and the brewery for your growler. When you transferred possession to the brewery, they gave you a claim ticket. This is similar to the Hyatt case, where the court held a bailment relationship was created, in part, because of the ticket given to the car owner when he left his car in a parking garage. The ticket identifies your growler with a transfer creates a bailment as to whatever property was transferred, with you, the transferor as the bailor and the recipient as the bailee. Bailees have a reasonable duty of care as to the property in their possession. Here, you have a very strong argument for a bailment relationship between you and the brewery for your growler. When you transferred possession to the brewery, they gave you a claim ticket. This is similar to the Hyatt case, where the court held a bailment relationship was created, in part, because of the ticket given to the car owner when he left his car in a parking garage. The ticket identifies your growler with a specific number, meaning only your corresponding ticket would be sufficient to regain possession from the brewery. Thus, a bailment was created and the brewery had a duty of reasonable care, which includes not breaking your property. You should be able to collect the value of your growler back from the brewery. Your argument is not as strong for your coat, I'm afraid. Although you did voluntarily transfer possession of the coat when you hung it on the coat rack, no such ticket was given identifying your coat and it was in an open space, easily accessible to all who hung their coats there. I do not think it would be reasonable for you to assume a bailment was created, and thus you would not be entitled to collect on your coat. The brewery will likely try to claim that you abandoned the property by leaving the brewery. In the case of your growler, this isn't a very strong argument in favor of the brewery. Even though you decided to leave without taking the broken growler or a new growler with you, you didn't say anything indicating you were relinquishing your rights to the property. However, when you couldn't find your coat, you said, ""forget it,"" and then left. This signals that you abandoned your coat when you couldn't find it and thus abandoned your rights with it. <QUESTION id='Q1' tell=""Essay Question 1(c): ""> <![CDATA[ The issues at hand are regarding Alex's rights against David and Edward. Alex's grant gave David a present possessory estate in Fee Simple subject to executory limitation and gave an executory interest in Fee Simple to his sons, Frank and Fred. Although Alex is angry, David merely making plans has not actually violated the terms of his grant, as it explicitly states that it will only transfer if the property is ever used for non-residential purposes. Furthermore, Frank and Fred's executory interest violates RAP: the terms of the grant state that ""if it is ever used for non-residential uses..."" then it will transfer. This interest does not necessarily have to vest or fail within 21 years of a life in being at the time of the grant. David may never violate the terms, and gave an executory interest in Fee Simple to his sons, Frank and Fred. Although Alex is angry, David merely making plans has not actually violated the terms of his grant, as it explicitly states that it will only transfer if the property is ever used for non-residential purposes. Furthermore, Frank and Fred's executory interest violates RAP: the terms of the grant state that ""if it is ever used for non-residential uses..."" then it will transfer. This interest does not necessarily have to vest or fail within 21 years of a life in being at the time of the grant. David may never violate the terms, and David's heirs 500 years into the future might never violate the terms of the grant. This is an example of how the RAP tries to limit dead hand control of a property. After striking the offending interest, we can see that we are left with, ""To David,"" creating a Fee Simple Absolute in David. Alex has no legal claims against his use of the property. However, Alex is also upset with Edward. The deed to Edward gives him a Fee Simple Defeasible and gives Alex the possibility of reverter. Alex has a much better claim here, as FSD and possibility of reverter are not subject to RAP. Thus, the conditions stipulated in the deed are valid, and if Edward begins making IPAs on the premises, Alex automatically regains title to the property. 3) "," The issue here is whether Betty has the title to Greenacre, whether Chris gained title through purchase in 2001, or whether Debbie has established title through Adverse Possession. Andrew and Betty, as tenants in the entirety, must jointly agree to sell their property (Greenacre). Because Andrew sold it fraudulently to Chris in 2001, Chris has color of title on this property as it was sold without the legal signature of one of the tenants. However, Debbie will argue that she has established Adverse Possession of the entire property of Greenacre. Adverse Possession is established when, after meeting the statute of limitations, the sleeping owner's interests have yielded to the adverse possessor through (1) continuous possession, where the adverse possessor occupies the property continuously (or in a customary manner) (2) hostile possession, which takes into account the state of mind of the adverse possessor (in New Suffolk, the statute does not say anything about good or bad faith, which means we can likely assume the jurisdiction doesn't care about state of mind) (3) exclusive sold without the legal signature of one of the tenants. However, Debbie will argue that she has established Adverse Possession of the entire property of Greenacre. Adverse Possession is established adverse when, after meeting the statute of limitations, the sleeping owner's interests have yielded to the possessor through (1) continuous possession, where the adverse possessor occupies the property continuously (or in a customary manner) (2) hostile possession, which takes into account the state of mind of the adverse possessor (in New Suffolk, the statute does not say anything about good or bad faith, which means we can likely assume the jurisdiction doesn't care about state of mind) (3) exclusive possession, where the adverse possessor exercises his right to exclude as a normal property owner would (4) actual, meaning the adverse possessor must physically and actually enter the property, and (5) open and notorious, meaning a reasonable property owner would have known that the property was being advsersely possessed. (Marengo Cave) Here, Andrew begain his adverse possession period in 2001 when he purchased Greenacre under color of title. He used it continuously (8 weeks a year for 8 years - in a similar manner to the previous owner), obtained hostile possession by treating it as his own property, exercised exclusive possession by only letting people onto the property with permission, as a normal property owner would do, actually possessed the entering the property for fishing and use, and was open and notorious in his possession because a normal property owner would have been able to see the possession had they not been sleeping on their rights. (Cahill v Morrow) Although Chris only maintained this adverse possession for 8 years, he legally transferred the property to his daughter Debbie in 2009, which means she is allowed to tack on her time of adverse possession to her father's. (Tieu v Morgan) Debbie is able to tack on her adverse possession to her father's because she also meets all the elements of adverse possession: she lives there full time (continuous), treats it as her own property by living there and creating gardens (hostile), exercises her right to exclude by ""allowing"" neighbors onto the property and setting boundaries as to what property is off limits (exclusive), actually established a residence (actual), and her possession would be apparent to any property owner not sleeping on their interests (open and notorious). Thus, the 8 years her father adversely possessed the property plus the 10 years she possessed the property create the necessary adverse possession and thus Becky will argue she has title to the entire property. Betty can try and argue that Debbie cannot tack on her father's adverse possession period, as he left the property to her in 2009 and she did not establish permanent residence until 2011, meaning that she has only adversely possessed the property for 8 years and thus Betty is within the 10 year statute of limitations period. The facts here do not indicate if Debbie used the property between 2009 and 2011: if she continued to to the entire property. Betty can try and argue that Debbie cannot tack on her father's adverse possession period, as he left the property to her in 2009 and she did not establish permanent residence until 2011, meaning that she has only adversely possessed the property for 8 years and thus Betty is within the 10 year statute of limitations period. The facts here do not indicate if Debbie used the property between 2009 and 2011: if she continued to visit for even 8 weeks a year like her father did before establishing permanent residence in 2011, she will likely be able to tack on her interest to her father's. If, however, she did not visit Greenacre, she may not satisfy the continuous element of adverse possession. Betty may also challenge the exclusive element of Debbie's adverse possession claim. When Betty moved onto the property, she began letting the neighbors onto the property to hunt at any time (whereas her father only allowed the neighbors onto the property when he was not at the cabin). However, Debbie still established clear boundaries for hunting, as a normal property owner would, meaning Betty would likely not prevail in this element and Debbie could claim exclusivity. Here, it seems likely that Debbie will satisfy all the requisite elements of adverse possession, and through color of title is able to keep the entire property. ",627,2131,908
b67facbd-5f35-4f52-9399-34cb9b6dbc66," We will first address the present and future interests of the named parties. Then we will discuss whether or not these interests are valid for the open classes. Because, under the RAP, party gifts must be valid for the entire class in order to be valid. The RAP applies to contingent remainders, vested remainders subject to open, executory interests and options or other contracts. A future interest, if valid under RAP, must vest, or not vest, within 21 years of a validating life in being. Oliver: Oliver owns a fee simple subject to executory limitation. RAP does not apply. The RAP does not apply to present posessory interests, or future interests of the grantor. The executory limitation is once the first of his children retires, they will take a life estate in his property. Connor and Carla have a contingent remainder in life estate to Oliver's property. Connor or Karla (whoever retires first) will get a life estate in Oliver's property. The condition they must meet is they must retire. Connor and Carla's interests are vaild under the RAP because they themselves are their own validating lives. In other words, at some point during Connor or Carla's life this interest will either vest or not vest. (They will either retire first or not retire). RAP does not care whether or not the interest fails or succeeds. Oliver's unborn kids (if he has additional kids after Carla and Karl) would also have a contingent remainder in O's property. This would be invalid under RAP because Oliver could have a kid Jacob, and then Oliver dies. Connor and Karla could also die, and Jacob retires at 40, well after the 21 year RAP timeline of the grant. The key to note here is that Oliver is granting his property, meaning the conveyance clock starts right now. He is not leaving it in a will where the clock for the RAP and all validating lives would start at the time of death. If he were leaving this in a will then this class and interest would be valid because all of Oliver's children would have to be alive before he died. Under the RAP rule, this would leave Connor and Carla's interests to be void because the entire class (O's children) is not valid. However, Connor and Carla could argue they should be eleigible for the gift in conveince because they are already alive. But a court would likely reject this because neither of them conveyance clock starts right now. He is not leaving it in a will where the clock for the RAP and all validating lives would start at the time of death. If he were leaving this in a will then this class and interest would be valid because all of Oliver's children would have to be alive before he died. Under the RAP rule, this would leave Connor and Carla's interests to be void because the entire class (O's children) is not valid. However, Connor and Carla could argue they should be eleigible for the gift in conveince because they are already alive. But a court would likely reject this because neither of them have retired yet. In other words, the gift of conveinece only applies if the actual conditions have been met or interests vested. We will discuss further in Victor/the grandchildren's class interest. Robert has a vested remainder in life estate. There are no words of limitation after Robert's mention, only words of purchase ""to Robert."" RAP will not apply to this interest because it is a closed class, not an open class. Victor has a vested remainder in fee simple, while Vivian has a contigent remainder in fee simple. The condition is that Victor and Vivian must reach the age of 25, which Victor has done. Vivian's interest would be valid under the RAP because she would be her own validating life. Victor's interest becuase it is vested would specifically to him not apply to RAP, although the interest of the entire class would as it is is a contingent remainder. For the unborn grandchildren, it would be a contingent remainder. This interest would be invalid under the RAP because Connor could have a child 50 years after the conveyance and that grandchild does not turn 25 for 75 years after conveyance. Again the rule of convenince comes into play, and could apply to Victor. Victor (26) has already met the condition of turning 25, and therefore has a vested remainder. He could argue he has already met the conditions, so despite the class being invalid, he should still get his fee simple. Thus rewritten the grant should read ""To my nephew Robert."" "," A.) The below will be a letter of explanation to Brock on possibilitties available to him. Brock, When you signed the deed with Alex back in 2003 you became tenants-in-common (TIC). Although the word ""jointly"" is used this is not a joint-tenancy as modern courts favor the tenants-in-common approach. U.S. v Craft outlines the differences between TIC's and joint-tenancys. As TICs, You both have the same rights to use and possess the property, and fractional rights to the money generated by the property. The difference between a joint-tenancy and a TIC is that in a joint-tenancy if your brother were to die you would get full control of the property via right of survivorship. Furthermore, in a joint- tenancy you would both have total undivided rights of use, posession, and money generated by the property. When your brother yelled at you to not come back, you could claim he ousted you. As we saw in Martin, ousters are eligible to request rent or profits via contributions from their co-tenant. Ousting simply means your brother has excluded you from use or posession of the land. If you go that route and decide to take an action against Alex for contributions, he can also take money from the sum you would receive for what he pays for property taxes, mortgages and upkeep of the beer distribution center. The courts will try to find an equitable balance between you two. That could get messy, I would recommend a partition in kind and then you sell your portion to the developer. A partition in kind simply means the property is split up. Courts favor this approach because as noted in Delfino, to take someone's property away via a partition in sale is an extremely invasive move and should try to be avoided. If you file for a partition in kind, you would have to show the 10 acres could be easily split up and distributed. That may be difficult because you don't know if the developer is interested in the warehouse space or the actual acreage of the land. Furthermore, you each own half of the warehouse, which would be difficult to split down the middle. But based on the developer's desire to develop the land into condos he is most likely interested in the entire land,whcih may make it easier to split up equally. If you decide to request a partition in sale because you want the money right now and to avoid divvying it up the burden would fall on you to show three things that are mentioned in Delfino. First, the land is interested in the warehouse space or the actual acreage of the land. Furthermore, you each own half of the warehouse, which would be difficult to split down the middle. But based on the developer's desire to develop the land into condos he is most likely interested in the entire land,whcih may make it easier to split up equally. If you decide to request a partition in sale because you want the money right now and to avoid divvying it up the burden would fall on you to show three things that are mentioned in Delfino. First, the land is inequitable and inefficient to split up, that either you or your brother would receive some benefit, and finally neither of you would be harmed. Here, it would be difficult to split the warehouse down the middle. In Delfino, one TIC owned the trash business, the other owned the empty portion of the land. You would likely succeed on the benefit to you and your brother. As you mentioned the developer wants to pay more than it is worth. However, where you would likely have trouble is cliaming neither of you would be harmed. In Delfino, the individual's livelihood, home and trash business was on his portion of the land. Similarily, Alex has a connection and fondness to the warehouse. A court would not likely sell it from him. However, this is distinguishable from Delfino because you also have an interest in the business. Ultimately, your best bet to make money from the developer would be to file for a partition in kind, where the land would be split up so that you would receive value for your 50% of the business, you could leave your brother 50% and sell your portion to the devleoper. B.) Carl's gold coins: Carl the issue is whether your gold coins are lost, abandoned, mislaid, or a treasure trove. For an item to be lost it must be unintentionally and involuntarily misplaced. For an item to be abandoned the owner must have placed the item somewhere and no longer wants it. To be mislaid, an item must be intentionally and voluntarily placed somewhere but forgotten. And for a treasure trove it must be hundreds of years old and be something of value like gold coins. Lost, abandoned, and treasure items would go to the finder, while mislaid would go to the storeowner. All claims would be secondary (except abandoned where the owner no longer wants it) to the the rightful and true owner. Because they are in a bag, the coins are unfortunately not likely lost, like in Armory where you would have right against everyone except the rightful owner. Your best argument would be that these coins should be considered treasure trove because they are from the 1800s and have signficiant value. If so, the courts would rule that you, as the finder, have superior cliam to the coins. Unfortunately, as we saw must be hundreds of years old and be something of value like gold coins. Lost, abandoned, and treasure items would go to the finder, while mislaid would go to the storeowner. All claims would be secondary (except abandoned where the owner no longer wants it) to the the rightful and true owner. Because they are in a bag, the coins are unfortunately not likely lost, like in Armory where you would have right against everyone except the rightful owner. Your best argument would be that these coins should be considered treasure trove because they are from the 1800s and have signficiant value. If so, the courts would rule that you, as the finder, have superior cliam to the coins. Unfortunately, as we saw in Corliss v Werner the courts have moved away from treasure trove rulings in order to discourage trespassers from walking onto people's land looking for treasure. In Corliss they ruled the items were embedded and rewarded the coins to the owner of the land. This is analogous to Corliss because the item appeared embedded in the warehouse floor. In this case, the court would likely rule the coins were either mislaid or embedded, and find the brewery to claim superior title to you, and to all others except the true owner. In McAvoy v Medina, mislaid property went to the owner of the store, and gave him a reasonable duty to take care of the item in the hopes the true owner would return. So, unfortunately, you cannot keep the coins. But there is hope because under Massachusetts law, when you find something worth more than 3$ and turn it in, if the true owner does not return for it in a year it can be rewarded to you. Bailment of the Growler: The issue is whether a bailment occurred when Carl handed over his grolwer. As we saw in Hyatt-Regency Hotel v Allen, a bailment is created when possession and control without title is voluntarily given to another individual. The bailor, Carl, gave his growler, to the brewery, the bailee. Therefore, the brewery has a reasonable responsibility to return the item in its same form. And if the brewery fails to do so, they must prove that they were not negligent. As we saw in Hyatt, the burden shifts to the brewery to show that no negligence occurred because Carl had turned over the growler. The brewery may have contracted out its responsibility to handle the growler like the parking garage ticket did in Hyatt. There the dissent referenced the ticket claiming no responsbility, the fact the attendant and exit was not constantly monitored, and the lack of keys as contributing to a true bailment not being in place because they lacked control. Carl, your case is diferent because your claim ticket made no reference to contracting out responsibility, and you clearly gave full possession and control to the brewery. You would likley be able to get reimbursement for the broken growler. The brewery may have contracted out its responsibility to handle the growler like the parking garage ticket did in Hyatt. There the dissent referenced the ticket claiming no responsbility, the fact the attendant and exit was not constantly monitored, and the lack of keys as contributing to a true bailment not being in place because they lacked control. Carl, your case is diferent because your claim ticket made no reference to contracting out responsibility, and you clearly gave full possession and control to the brewery. You would likley be able to get reimbursement for the broken growler. Coat: A bailment was not formed for hanging your coat on the wall. There was no possesion and control given to the brewery. You did not hand your coat to anyone specifcially. A ticket was not provided, like the growler or parking lot in Hyatt. Had there been a coat check, a bailment would likely have been created and a reasonable duty of care established by the brewery. This does not appear to be the case. However, the good news is you likely misplaced your coat, therefore if someone finds it, the brewery will have a reasonable duty to watch the coat. C. David/Edward's Interests David's Interest: Alex, when you deeded the 5 acres of land to David you gave him a fee simple subject to exec limitation because if he uses the property for anything other than residential use, it will shift to Frank and Fred, who have a springing executory interest in the property. The ""so long as"" does not create a fee simple determinable because the property does not revert back to the grantor. Because David is planning to use it for non-residential use you could remind him that the property would shift to his sons if he does so. However, as we saw in Ford v Allen, courts are typically hesitant to restrict alienability of property. There we saw limits on a lease rejected because it limited what the property could be used for. This is similar, because you have limited the use of the property for David. He may be able to provide great benefit to the society through residences and commercial stores, so a court may rule in David's favor because you sold him the land. Again similar to Ford/Allen and RAP, the court does not likle dead hand control of property once it has passed from one person to another. Edward's Interest Alex, your deed to Edward created a fee simple determinable because of the ""so long as"" language. You also included a ""right to re-enter"". However, for fee simple determinables, you would have the stores, so a court may rule in David's favor because you sold him the land. Again similar to Ford/Allen and RAP, the court does not likle dead hand control of property once it has passed from one person to another. Edward's Interest Alex, your deed to Edward created a fee simple determinable because of the ""so long as"" language. You also included a ""right to re-enter"". However, for fee simple determinables, you would have the possibility of reverter, which means if IPA's were made, you would automatically get the title to the land back. This mix up, unfortunately, made your deed ambigous. In Craigen, a will or deed is ambiguous if more than one meaning can be interpreted from the language. This is the case here. When wills are ambiguous courts like to limit the transition of titles, and lean toward giving fee simples, so that full control of the property is devised or conveyed. As we saw in Marenholz, where a similar situation occurred, the court ruled the ""only for purposes of the school board"" language was a fee simple subject to condition subsquent. Fee simple subject to condition subsequents offer a right of re-entry to the grantor. This would require an affirmitve step to regain the title. Modern courts favor fee simple subject to condition subsequents because it requires an affirmtive action on the grantor to take back the property. Therefore, they would likely view Edward's deed as a fee simple subject to condition subsquent. A court would likely rule to strike your condition for David to not be able to sell IPA's. Courts do not like to rule for the wishes and hopes of grantors and because you sold to Edward they would probably deny your affirmative action to take back the property. Edward should have the right to run a successful business and furnish the markets. As we saw in Keeble, a person's right to livelihood is more important than someone else's negative actions (scaring away his ducks) that provide no vlaue to the society. This is similar because Alex has no interest in preventing IPA Sales, other than his dislike of them. "," D. Adverse Possession Andrew/Betty were tenants by the entirery, meaning they have a right of surviviorship. This is distinguishable between a joint-tenancy because it cannot be severed unilateraly both parties must agree. Furthermore, the marriage is looked upon as a unit and or single entity. Andrew/Betty do not have separate rights in the property. Also, this is similar to a joint-tenancy because both have the right of survivorship. Tenants in unit require 5 unities - time, title, possession, interest, and marraige. In 2001, when Andrew sold Greenacre to Chris this was invalid because Andrew had no right to do so. Furthermore, in 2004 when Chris died, his interest would have disappeared along with the sale to Chris. As we saw in Harms v Sprague, a mortgage/lien in a joint-tenancy did not survive the death of one of the tenants because their interest simply disappeared. Therefore, in 2004, through right of survivorship the property would have went to Betty. The sale would not have survived Chris' death. Had Chris evaded taxes after he stopped going to 9GreenAcre, Betty unfortunately would have likely been forced to pay them. In U.S. v Kraft, tax evasion for tenants by the entirety did survive trying to break up the interest. Although Justice Thomas dissented arguing for the protection of the stay at home Furthermore, in 2004 when Chris died, his interest would have disappeared along with the sale to Chris. As we saw in Harms v Sprague, a mortgage/lien in a joint-tenancy did not survive the death of one of the tenants because their interest simply disappeared. Therefore, in 2004, through right of survivorship the property would have went to Betty. The sale would not have survived Chris' death. Had Chris evaded taxes after he stopped going to GreenAcre, Betty unfortunately would have likely been forced to pay them. In U.S. v Kraft, tax evasion for tenants by the entirety did survive trying to break up the interest. Although Justice Thomas dissented arguing for the protection of the stay at home spouse, the courts ruled that it would be a way to evade taxes. This example it does not seem like any foul play was invovled, so therefore Betty would likely not be required to pay any overdue taxes. Debbie's best claim for the property over Betty is through adverse possession (AP). As we saw in Pimental, Debbie would have to prove the use was continuous, hostile, exclusive, actual and open and notorious. Also in Pimental, years can be tacked on through consensual privity. Chris purchased in 2001 and rightfully beleived he owned all 50 acres, therefore Debbie would be able to tack on Chris' usage dating back to 2001. We will address each element of AP below. Debbie will likely fail to make an AP claim on the basis that her and her brother's usage was not continous during the 2009-2011 gap. All other elements will likely be satisfied. Continous - Although Chris only used for 8 weeks per year, we saw in Cahill, that normal usage of a property is valid for continuous use. In other words, seasonal or summer use would be continuous. However, the two year gap between 2009-2011 would be Betty's best bet to challenge the continuinity of the use. This is key because the clock for 10 year statute would strart over in 2011 after the gap in usage, and thus make the Debbie's AP claim invalid as not meeting the ten year mark. The courts may hold in favor of Debbie for continuity arguing that a reasonable person that inherited property may not immediately travel to the property. Hostile - The use must be at least without the owner's permission. The Cahil court showed that the individual claiming AP's intent is irrelevant. Some courts rule the hostile possession must be in good faith meaning the person actually believed they owned the property. This situtation is analogous to Tieu who purchased ""fully fenced"" in property because Debbie/Chris believed they were the true owners via a 50 acre conveyance. The minority Maine court rules the permission must be in bad faith meaning you have to know it is not your property. Here Debbie believed it was her property. Regardless, hostile is likely valid for the AP claim. Exclusive - Although, Debbie allowed neigbors to use the property, we saw in Tieu letting someone individual claiming AP's intent is irrelevant. Some courts rule the hostile possession must be in good faith meaning the person actually believed they owned the property. This situtation is analogous to Tieu who purchased ""fully fenced"" in property because Debbie/Chris believed they were the true owners via a 50 acre conveyance. The minority Maine court rules the permission must be in bad faith meaning you have to know it is not your property. Here Debbie believed it was her property. Regardless, hostile is likely valid for the AP claim. Exclusive - Although, Debbie allowed neigbors to use the property, we saw in Tieu letting someone park a car in the driveway, providing permission to use property does not preclude an AP claim. Owners may use it as a normal property owner would. Actual - Debbie uses the property as an owner would . She's built a year-round house, has cleared it of trees, and created a formal garden. Betty will argue Debbie is not actually using the rest of the 50 acres of the property, which she has a good case for. Open/Notorious - Debbie will have to prove her usage was open and notorious that a reasonable person going by the land could tell it was being used. The two acres around her house would meet this requirement becuase it is clear that the house and garden are occupying the space. Debbie does not have to provide actual notice to Betty, but rather constructive notice. This is to discourage sleeping owners, like Betty who ignore their property. Furthermore, it's worth mentioning, though not relevant, minor encroachments, like in Gorski, do require actual notice because it is not reasonable to know your property is being used. Now that we have addressed each element of Adverse Possesion we can predict how the courts will rule. Courts typically try to be equitable when ruling on issues like before us. The break in continuity may shatter the adverse possession timeline, but a court may find Debbie's improvements to the land, specifically her 2 acres favorable and provide her the 2 acres. The courts could then provide Betty the rest of the 48 acres on the basis that they were never actually possessed. This would be an equitable result from this issue. ",777,2212,1101
7b622388-4835-41b0-916e-bb4ca373d6c4," Oliver Owner's grant conveys a contingent remainder in a life estate subject to open to the first of his children to retire. Whether that will be conveyed to his son, Connor, his daughter, Carla, or a future unborn child is unknown, because the living children are both still employed and therefore have not satisfied the condition precedent. (This means Oliver Owner maintains a present possessory interest in the property for the time being.) The grant also conveys a vested remainder in a life estate to Robert. Oliver's grandson, Victor, has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple absolute, because he has already reached the condition of turning 25, yet he may have to eventually share this interest with Vivian and any potential other grandchildren of Oliver. Vivian herself has an executory interest in fee simple absolute, because she is under 25. Under the common law rule, any unborn children of Connor or Carla also maintain an executory interest in fee simple. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP) only applies to three types of interests: executory interests, contingent remainders, and vested remainders subject to open. The rule states that interests must vest, if at all, within 21 years of the end of a life in being at the creation of the interest. The first future interest conveyed is the contingent remainder in a life estate for Oliver Owner's first child to retire. Oliver's two children, Connor and Carla are two lives in being at the time of creation of the interest. While it is true that they have to be alive in order to retire, there is a possibility that neother of them will ever retire before their deaths, and that Oliver will have another child who is not yet alive who does not retire within 21 years of any of the people alive at the time the grant was created. Therefore, this conveyance is invalid under the RAP. The next future interest is the vested remainder in a life estate conveyed to Robert. Since this interest is both vested and a life estate, the RAP will not apply here. Victor's vested remainder subject to open in fee simple absolute is subject to the RAP. Contrary to the common law rule, the Rule of Convenience says that the class will close once one person satisfies the condition, which Victor has done. That means only Victor and Vivian would maintain future interests in the property. Under this reform, potential violation of the RAP is avoided. Furthermore, Vivian's interest The next future interest is the vested remainder in a life estate conveyed to Robert. Since this interest is both vested and a life estate, the RAP will not apply here. Victor's vested remainder subject to open in fee simple absolute is subject to the RAP. Contrary to the common law rule, the Rule of Convenience says that the class will close once one person satisfies the condition, which Victor has done. That means only Victor and Vivian would maintain future interests in the property. Under this reform, potential violation of the RAP is avoided. Furthermore, Vivian's interest will either vest or fail within the next 7 years, and she can act as her own life in being, as she was alive at the time of conveyance. This means neither Victor nor Vivian's interests violate the RAP. Therefore, the only part of the conveyance that is void under the RAP is the future interest conveyed to Oliver's first child to retire. If this part is stricken, the grant would read: ""to my nephew Robert for life, then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25."" 2) "," 1A: Brock, the issue in question is whether you have a right to sell or otherwise convey the property that you share with your brother Alex. Your concurrent interest in the property is that of a tenancy in common. This means that you and Alex share an undivided interest in the whole property. You do not have a right to unilaterally sever the property. If you and Alex can come to a mutual agreement to partition the property, you will have two options: a partition in kind or a partition by sale. Alex is likely to oppose the latter, because it entails a physical sale of the entire property and then distribution of the profits from the sale amongst the tenants in common. The court is unlikely to choose this option unless they deem it difficult (or impossible) to physically divide the property in question. As shown in Delfino v. Vealencis, operation of a successful business may play a role in the court's decision regarding partition. A partition in kind would entail a physical separation of the property according to your fractional share of land. Since the warehouse itself is of the most sentimental value to your brother, you could potentially propose a partition in kind where he retains the land with his brewery, and you could separately own some of the surrounding property,3which you could then sell to the developer. Additionally, it is important to note that even if you cease contributing to the business, you may also be entitled to some financial benefits from the business so long as you prove that your brother has ousted v. Vealencis, operation of a successful business may play a role in the court's decision regarding partition.

Additionally, it is important to note that even if you cease contributing to the business, you may also be entitled to some financial benefits from the business so long as you prove that your brother has ousted you. From what you have told me, he has only told you to get off the property, which does not constitute an ouster. However, if he blocks your return by, for instance, changing the locks on the warehouse doors, that may be enough to prove you have been ousted, and you may be entitled to compensation from his business's profits. 1B: Dear Carl: Your first issue is whether you, as a finder of the gold coins at Alex Apple's brewery, are entitled to keep them as your own. There are several different rules regarding found property, depending on the circumstances. The first is abandoned property, which would mean that the owner fully released all title to the property in question. That does not apply here, because there is no proof that the rightful previous owner has no intention to come back for the coins. The next type of found property is lost property, which applies when an owner unknowingly misplaces something and does not have knowledge as to its location. That also does not apply to this scenario, as the bag of gold coins were clearly hidden and not accidentally misplaced. Another category is mislaid property, which applies to a scenario in which someone forgets about their property's location and may potentially come back for it if they re-trace their steps. And the last category is that of treasure trove, which applies when someone (usually from long ago) hides their property for safekeeping. It looks as though these gold coins may either be considered as mislaid or treasure trove. The traditional rule for mislaid property states that the original owner has the superior claim to the object in question, and the owner of the premises in which it is found has the second highest claim. If a court determines that these coins are mislaid, then unfortunately for you, Alex Apple will have a superior relative claim. However, we can argue that the warehouse is old and the coins are dated to the 1800s, which would more likely classify it as treasure trove. In this case, the finder of the property - you, in this case - has a superior right to the coins over all except the rightful owner. The hiccup in this case is that the coins were found in a mesh bag from a either be considered as mislaid or treasure trove. The traditional rule for mislaid property states that the original owner has the superior claim to the object in question, and the owner of the premises in which it is found has the second highest claim. If a court determines that these coins are mislaid, then unfortunately for you, Alex Apple will have a superior relative claim. However, we can argue that the warehouse is old and the coins are dated to the 1800s, which would more likely classify it as treasure trove. In this case, the finder of the property - you, in this case - has a superior right to the coins over all except the rightful owner. The hiccup in this case is that the coins were found in a mesh bag from a local shopping bag which opened just 10 years ago. This means that it is unlikely that the coins have been stashed away for centuries, and are probably hidden by someone who knows their location. It's likely that a court, for that reason alone, will classify the coins as mislaid rather than treasure trove, which, like the situation in Corliss v. Wenner, would entitle the property owner rather than the finder. Your second issue is whether you entered a bailment with the bartender when you gave him your growler. A bailment can be created either expressly or implicitly, and in this case, the bartender taking your property and issuing a claim tag is sufficient to establish a bailor-bailee relationship. Bailees are expected to assume a reasonable duty of care under the circumstances. When the property in question is not returned or is damaged, the bailee holds the burden of proof in demonstrating that they acted reasonably and are not liable. The fact that he entered into this relationship knowingly and voluntarily and the use of a claim ticket to retrieve the growler both support your claim that the bartender/the warehouse are liable for your property. In Allen v. Hyatt-Regency Nashville, self-parking a car in an enclosed garage was enough to establish a reasonable expectation of care. For that reason, it seems as though a physical transfer of your property to a trained bartended who issued you a receipt will be more than sufficient to prove that a bailment was created. On the other hand, these facts do not necessarily apply to your jacket which you left on the hook by the door. No express bailment was created, but referring to the aforementioned case, Allen, an implicit bailment may have been created since you relied upon the safekeeping of your coat on a hook intended for use by brewery customers. However, there was most likely no one supervising the hooks (akin to the security guards/attendants in the Allen case) and therefore the warehouse will argue that you chose to hang your coat at your own risk. 1C: Alex, the issue at hand is whether the parties have5interests in the land according to your deed. In the deed, you conveyed to David a fee simple subject to executory limitation. Frank and Fred had executory interests in fee simple in the property. Since David ceased to obey the condition, Frank and to hang your coat at your own risk. 1C: Alex, the issue at hand is whether the parties have interests in the land according to your deed. In the deed, you conveyed to David a fee simple subject to executory limitation. Frank and Fred had executory interests in fee simple in the property. Since David ceased to obey the condition, Frank and Fred now have title to the property. The language in the other deed, to Edward, is a bit ambiguous. It seems to convey to Edward a fee simple determinable, due to the use of words of duration ""so long as"". The future interest that follows this interest is a possibility of reverter in the grantor, which occurs automatically. However, the language following this states that you have the right to re-enter and claim the premises, which seems to indicate a right of entry, the future interest that follows a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Either way, since Edward failed to obey the condition, you have a right to take over the property. "," The issue at question is whether Debbie holds proper title to Greenacre through the doctrine of adverse possession. The property was initially owned by both Betty and Andrew as tenants by the entirety. This is a special type of concurrent interest which must have been conveyed to two married tenants at the same time, with the same deed. This concurrent interest has a feature called the right of survivorship, which means that if one tenant dies, the other maintains the whole interest of the property. Andrew conveyed his interest to Chris in 2001 by forging Betty's name on the deed. This means Chris had an invalid document that he believed to convey ownership to Greenacre. When Andrew died in 2004, Betty became the sole owner of Greenacre. However, there is a question as to whether Chris and Debbie adversely possessed this land. Adverse possession can be established once the statute of limitations has run and when the following five elemetns have been satisfied: actual, open/notorious, continuous, exclusive, and hostile/adverse. Chris and Debbie both actually possessed the property - they were physically present and used it as actual owners would. The facts show that Chris did reparations on the small wooden cabin and lived in it for some time as he used the land for hunting and enjoying 8 the outdoors. Andrew, the previous owner, used this land for these same purposes - to enjoy the outdoors. Chris's use, therefore, mirrors that of an actual owner and would therefore likely satisfy this element. Debbie's decision to move to the land full Adverse possession can be established once the statute of limitations has run and when the following five elemetns have been satisfied: actual, open/notorious, continuous, exclusive, and hostile/adverse. Chris and Debbie both actually possessed the property - they were physically present and used it as actual owners would. The facts show that Chris did reparations on the small wooden cabin and lived in it for some time as he used the land for hunting and enjoying the outdoors. Andrew, the previous owner, used this land for these same purposes - to enjoy the outdoors. Chris's use, therefore, mirrors that of an actual owner and would therefore likely satisfy this element. Debbie's decision to move to the land full time shows that she definitely used the property as an actual owner would. The next issue is whether Chris and Debbie's use was open and notorious. This element means that the use of the land was not camoflauged, and was clearly observable. This may hold true for Chris, who attempted to renovate the cabin. It definitely applies to Debbie, who cleared trees on the land and build a garden. Next, we must look to identify whether Chris and Debbie's use was continous. Chris occupied the land 8 weeks per year, but this correlates with fishing season. A court will most likely hold that this is continuous under the circumstances and is a reasonable time to use the land. Debbie's full-time residence on the land would definitely satisfy this element of ocntinuous use. Exclusive use is the next element that must be satisfied. This indicates that adverse possessors must maintain a sense of exclusive ownership. While Chris and Debbie often allowed neighbors to hunt and fish on the land, this does not invalidate the satisfaction of their exclusive use. Granting permission to others from time to time is accepted. Lastly, Chris and Debbie's possession of the land must be hostile. Depending on the jurisdiction, there are different requirements as to the state of mind of the possessors. In some jurisdictions, there is an objective standard, which means the mental state regarding the property is irrelevant. In other states, however, there is a subjective requirement. In ""bad-faith"" states, possessors are required to know that they do not have the superior claim to the property. In this case, Chris and Debbie believed to have been conveyed title to the property in 2001, not knowing that Betty's signature was forged. Therefore, they would not be acting in ""bad faith."" Some states, however, require a ""good-faith"" subjective standard, which means that they must honestly believe that they have claim to the land. In these jurisdictions, Chris and Debbie would satisfy the hostile element of adverse possession. Another issue is whether Debbie has adversely possessed the land beyond the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations in New Suffolk is 10 years, or an additional 7 years added from the end of a disability (whichever period is longer). Debbie technically only moved onto the land in 2011. Since it is currently 2019, only 8 years have passed since she has been adversely possessing Greenacre, which in privity, which means voluntarily and in would not be sufficient. However, when land is conveyed writing, adverse possessors may tack on the years of former inhabitants. So, since Chris began adversely possessing the land in 2001, and the current year is 2019, 18 years have passed, which would Another issue is whether Debbie has adversely possessed the land beyond the statute of limitations.

So, since Chris began adversely possessing the land in 2001, and the current year is 2019, 18 years have passed, which would satisfy the length of time required. Betty will argue that Debbie is only actively using the two acres where she resides. This could mean that the land she has adversely possessed is limited to that of which she is actively using. Betty, for that reason, will most likely be able to retain her property interest in the remaining 48 acres of land. However, Debbie will argue that she has color of title since Betty, the true owner, was not present for several years and never made an effort to establish her domain over Greenacre. Based on the facts listed above, it seems as though a court would reason that Debbie has successfully adversely possessed Greenacre. Although Andrew falsely conveyed the land to Chris, and Betty's right of survivorship gave her full ownership of the land, she did not maintain active use of Greenacre and therefore, by doctrine of adverse possession, Debbie is most likely to have a superior claim. As long as the court does not find Chris or Debbie's use to invalidate any of the five elements, Debbie has a legal claim to the land, as her and her father's collective time spent there outruns the 10-year statute of limitations period.

68975dd8-703c-43ba-8247-1e6cde4fe067," Both Carla and Connor have executory interests in life estate. This is because The first child of Oliver has a contingent remainder in life estate. Robert has a vested remainder in life estate. The grandchildren to reach the age of 21 have contingent remainders subject to open in fee simple. Specifically, Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple and Vivian has a contingent remainder subject to open in fee simple. The contingent remainder in life estate to Oliver's first child to retire applies to the Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP). Likewise, the contingent remainder of the grandchildren applies. The contingent remainder to Oliver's first child to retire is valid under the RAP. Therefore, since at the time that the deed was created, this is an ascertained life, we know that within the lives of Oliver's children, this remainder must vest or fail within one of their lives. The contingent remainder subject to open in fee simple to the grandchildren of Oliver is void under the rule of Perpetuities. This is because After Oliver dies, it would be more than 21 years after his death to see which one of his grandchildren turn 25. However, the rule of convenience may apply to Oliver's current grandchildren, since Victor is 26, which is older than the contingent of reaching 25-years-old. However, if Oliver Owner did not have any children at the time of the will, the contingent remainder in life estate for his first child to retire would be void under the RAP. This is because his first child could retire 21 years after Oliver died. The children of Oliver could have all worked until they turned 100 and died without retiring. "," The issue is whether Brock and Alex are joint tenants or tenants in common. After Alex opened his brewery, he devised deed that stated ""I, Alex Apple hereby grant this land to myself and my brother Brock to hold jointly as tenants in common."" The rule for tenants in common is that each tenant will share 1/ the land, with right to use all of the property. In contrast, a joint tenancy has a right to survivorship. This language is ambiguous, because he states that the siblings will be tenants in common, yet that they will ""hold jointly"". This language sounds more like a tenancy in common since they will hold the property as tenants in common, and also because the doctrine prefers for tenancy in common when the language is ambiguous. In conclusion, Brock and Alex are tenants in common, meaning that each brother owns 50% of the brewery. The next issue is whether Brock can sell the brewery to the developer with partition in sale as opposed to partition in kind. The doctrine prefers splitting up land by partition in kind as opposed to partition by sale, although courts most frequently use partition by sale. To use partition by sale, the court will have to prove that 1) it is impracticable to split up the land in equal pieces, 2) that at least one tenant will benefit from the division, and that no one will be particularly jeopordized by the sale. Delfino v. Vealencis. The court is likely to deem that it is not impracticable to divide the land through partition by kind since there are only two tenants in common. However, dividing land into equal portions is always difficult. Next, Alex really loves his brewery and is passionate about it. Therefore, he would be jeopardized as a result of losing his land, just like Vealencis loved her garbage disposal company and would be jeopordized to lose it. Finally, one tenant, Brock, would benefit from the sale of the land, so only one of three requirements would be satisfied. Brock could simply sell his tenancy in common to Bostonia to make money off of them in that way. Or Brock could put on some puppy eyes and continue trying to convince Alex to sell the land. However, this seems unlikely since Alex has wanted his likely that the court will grant a partition in kind own brewery for his whole life. In conclusion, it is3 more instead of by sale. would be jeopordized to lose it. Finally, one tenant, Brock, would benefit from the sale of the land, so only one of three requirements would be satisfied. Brock could simply sell his tenancy in common to Bostonia to make money off of them in that way. Or Brock could put on some puppy eyes and continue trying to convince Alex to sell the land. However, this seems unlikely since Alex has wanted his own brewery for his whole life. In conclusion, it is more likely that the court will grant a partition in kind instead of by sale. As an afterthought, the Lockian labor theory benefits those who work on the land and create something. This therefore strengthens Alex's argument that he is the possessor of his property. Dear Carl, After looking over your claim, I have written a letter to you describing your legal rights with regards to the coins, growler, and coat. The first issue is whether the coins can be classified as treasure trove or embedded. The rule for treasure trove is that the coins would go to the finder of the coins, and the rule for embedded properthy is that they would go to the owner of the property that they were found in. Although the coins are very old, they were located in a plastic shopping bag. The store that gives out those shopping bags is only ten years old. In contrast to Corliss v. Wenner, the coins, which were deemed embedded, were hidden in a glass container that seemed very old. As a result, it is likely that the coins are neither treasure trove nor embedded since they clearly recently hidden in the wooden brewery. Because the brewery is also new, it is likely that someone--in the previous 10 years--placed the coins in the shopping bag and hid them in the hole of the floor in the brewery. This property is then likely to be mislaid, since the previous owner likely wanted to come back for the coins. After all, the coins are very valuable in price. The issue, then, is whether you can keep the coins or if they belong to the brewery. The rule for mislaid property is that the original owner has possession to the property, and if the original owner never returns for the in a glass container that seemed very old. As a result, it is likely that the coins are neither treasure trove nor embedded since they clearly recently hidden in the wooden brewery. Because the brewery is also new, it is likely that someone--in the previous 10 years--placed the coins in the shopping bag and hid them in the hole of the floor in the brewery. This property is then likely to be mislaid, since the previous owner likely wanted to come back for the coins. After all, the coins are very valuable in price. The issue, then, is whether you can keep the coins or if they belong to the brewery. The rule for mislaid property is that the original owner has possession to the property, and if the original owner never returns for the property, it would belong to the owner of the property that the coins were recovered in. Similar to Benjamin v. Linden Aviation Coroporation, it could also be likely that whoever hid the coins had bad intentions. It is strange that someone would simply hide coins, which are very valuable, in a place that is difficult to reach. The rule that came out of the Benjamin case is that the money belongs to the owner of the property that the money was found in since the original owner is suspected to have bad intentions. In conclusion, the coins would belong to the brewery since that is where the coins were found, even if the original owner of the coins comes back for them. Regarding your growler and your coat, you are the original and rightful owner, good against the world. The issue is if someone else took your coat/growler, claiming that they were the finder of either piece, would they have claim to title over it, or would you? You clearly cared about your property, especially the growler. The rule for mislaid property is that it belongs to the original owner first, and if the original owner never comes back to recover the property, it will belong to the owner of the property that it was found in. If someone else took your growler, thinking it was lost, they would be wrong to take your growler. Because you cared about it, it is unlikely that you were just throwing it out. Therefore, your growler is mislaid proeprty, similar to the wallet that was left behind at the barbershop in McAvoy v. Medina. You are the rightful owner of the property, and it belongs to you. If the growler is not broken but is found at the brewery again, it should be returned to you since you are the rightful owner. If it shows up again at the brewery but you never go back to reclaim it, it would belong to the brewery. The same analysis would apply to your coat. However, if your coat was lost and not mislaid (since you didn't really care about it and maybe you instead left it on the floor somewhere), the finder would have possession over it, similar to the result of Armory v. Delamarie. However, since you are the original owner of the coat, even if the coat was lost instead of mislaid, it should still belong to you first and foremost. The rule for lost property is that the finder becomes the owner of the property, good against the world, except for the true owner. In conclusion, you have property rights over both your coat and growler. 4) didn't really care about it and maybe you instead left it on the floor somewhere), the finder would have possession over it, similar to the result of Armory v. Delamarie. However, since you are the original owner of the coat, even if the coat was lost instead of mislaid, it should still belong to you first and foremost. The rule for lost property is that the finder becomes the owner of the property, good against the world, except for the true owner. In conclusion, you have property rights over both your coat and growler. 4) The first issue is what property interest David Developer has. This deed is clearly defeasible since there is a condition that can cut off the interest at any time. Therefore, because there is a third party that is involved in this deed, David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation. Frank and Fred both have executory interests in fee simple. Because there is an executory interest, the Rule Against Perpetuities applies. Since the land can be used for non-residential purposes at any time, including 21 years after the life in being ceases, the Rule Against Perpetuities would void Frank and Fred's executory interests in fee simple, therefore leaving David with the fee simple. As a result, David would have complete control of the property, and there would be nothing that Alex could do to get the land back unless David sells it to him. The next issue is what property interest Edward has--either a fee simpel determinable or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Edward has a fee simple determinable since he can lose the property at any time if IPAs are made on the property. However, the language is ambiguous. Although it seems as though Edward has a fee simple determinable becuase of the language that connotes time, ""so long as,"" the deed also states that Alex may re-enter if the condition is broken. Fee simple determinables are followed by a possibility of reverter instead of a right of reentry. The difference is important because, like in Marenholz v. School board, the grantor will have to do something extra to get the property back, whereas the grantor will automatically get the property back if the conditions have not been met. Since we want easier transfer of land, and because Alex is so passionate about IPAs not being made, it is presumable that Edward has a fee simple determinable. In conclusion, Edward has a fee simple determinable and Alex, the grantor, has a possibility of reverter. This means that Alex will automatically get the property back from Edward and do whatever he wants with it. followed by a possibility of reverter instead of a right of reentry.

This means that Alex will automatically get the property back from Edward and do whatever he wants with it. "," The issue is whether Betty has claim over Greenacre, or if Debbie has successfully adversely possessed the land. The rule for adverse possession is that the statute of limitations must be met, which is 10 years. Additionally, the possession over the property in question must be actual, notorious and open, exclusive, continuous, and hostile/adverse. After Andrew died, Betty had full possession over the land since they were tenants by entirety. When someone is a tenant by entirety, the surviving tenant has full claim to all of the land; they have right to survivorship, such as the individuals US v Craft. However, there was no mention in debt in this case, so the attachment of debt to both tenants by entirety is irrelevant. This means that Betty has full possession of the land unless the title was ever severed at any point. A tenant by entirety cannot sever the title on their own and cannot sell interest in the tenancy by entirety on their own. Therefore, unless Debbie adversely possessed the land, all of Greenacre would belong to Debbie. Chris never severed the interest successfully because he did not do so mutually with Betty, and also because he was never divorced to Betty. The first issue is whether Debbie can tack on the time that Chris had. Like in Tieu v. Morgan, in order for two parties to tack the time together, they must have been in privity. Because the property was not previously adversely possessed (Andrew and Betty were the rightful owners) and becuase it was not previously foreclosed, Debbie should be able to tack on the time that Chris had the land. Additionally, neither Andrew nor Debbie had a disability. Therefore, the eight years that Chris adversely possessed the land with the eight years that Debbie possessed the land equals 16 years, which is more than the 10 The first issue is whether Debbie can tack on the time that Chris had. Like in Tieu v. Morgan, in order for two parties to tack the time together, they must have been in privity. Because the property was not previously adversely possessed (Andrew and Betty were the rightful owners) and becuase it was not previously foreclosed, Debbie should be able to tack on the time that Chris had the land. Additionally, neither Andrew nor Debbie had a disability. Therefore, the eight years that Chris adversely possessed the land with the eight years that Debbie possessed the land equals 16 years, which is more than the 10 required by the statute of limitations. All of the rules arrive from the Pimental case, Marengo Cave case, Tieu v. Morgan case. The issue is if Debbie actually possessed the land. The rule for actually possessing the land is that she must use it as average people use their land. She built a house and lived there year-round. Therefore, her possession was actual. The issue is if Debbie openly and notoriously possessed the land. This means that she must put the previous owner on notice. She had an actual house that she built, and she even cleared some trees and grew a garden. This is arguably enough notice for Betty to see that someone else is adversely possessing Greenacre. The issue is if Debbie is exclusive with her possession. This means that she must exclude other people from coming onto her land. Arguably, she was. She only let people come onto the property with her permission. The issue is if Debbie is continuous with her possession of Greenacre. She lived there year-round, and used it like an average person, so she was arguably continuous. The issue is if Debbie was hostile/adverse. Some jurisdictions require an objective knowledge to adversely possessing the land. Others require people to possess the land in good faith, and others in bad faith. Debbie possessed the land in good faith. Since only one jurisdiction (Maine) requires the The issue is if Debbie is continuous with her possession of Greenacre. She lived there year-round, and used it like an average person, so she was arguably continuous. The issue is if Debbie was hostile/adverse. Some jurisdictions require an objective knowledge to adversely possessing the land. Others require people to possess the land in good faith, and others in bad faith. Debbie possessed the land in good faith. Since only one jurisdiction (Maine) requires the possessor to be in bad faith, it is most likely that Debbie was hostile/adverse in adversely possessing the property. Her thoughts were also objective. It is clear that she thought the property belonged to her after her father, Chris, gave it to her. However, Betty will argue that the statute of limitations cannot be met since Chris never adversely possessed the property. If someone did not meet one of the requirements, they could not adversely possess the property. Therefore, tacking would not be possible. This is because Chris arguably was not continuous with his possession of the land. He was there only for eight weeks out of the year. This is very little time in comparison to twelve months out of the entire year. Additionally, Betty will argue that Chris was not exclusive over the property. He let anyone come onto the property when he was not there. Although Chris argued that they had his permission, Betty will argue that strangers were on the land for 10 months and two weeks out of the year and that this could not be exclusive. In conclusion, Betty will argue that Chris never adversely possessed the land and no tacking could occur, thus leaving the entire property to Betty, who has tenancy by entirety over the land. Another issue is if Debbie can use color of title. The rule is that if she possessed some of the land, she can have all of it if she took it in a rightful manner. Although Andrew forged Betty's signature, Chris was under good faith when he purchased it in cash from Andrew, and should therefore be allowed to claim color of title. In conclusion, Debbie should be the actual owner of Greenacre through her successful adverse possession. In conclusion, Debbie should be the actual owner of Greenacre through her successful adverse possession. ",282,1934,1029

"," A) Dear Brock, Thank you for coming by my office earlier it was great speaking with you. With regards to your property interest and the possibilities avaiable to you the deed signed by your brother, Alex, that states you both own the land as tenants in common does not allow you to sell the entire property to the developer. You and your brother each have rights to the land and if you attempted to sell all 10 acres to the developer you would in fact be violating you brother's rights as a tenant in common. However, you can convey your interest in your part of the land to the developer and he would then become a tenant in common with Alex, but he would not have full rights to the land. You could also buy your brother's interest in the property, contingent on him agreeing to sell it to you, then you could sell the entire land to the developer. developer.

You could also buy your brother's interest in the property, contingent on him agreeing to sell it to you, then you could sell the entire land to the developer. B) Dear Carl, Thank you for coming into my office earlier it was great speaking with you. With regards to your growler that was broken the issue is was there a bailment created when you gave the bartender your growler and recieved a ticket that would be used to retrieve it. The answer is yes, when you exchanged your growler for the ticket a bailment was created and the bartender then accepted a duty of care towards your growler. By dropping and breaking your growler the bartender violated their duty of care and can be held responsible to replace it or compensate you for the loss.However, with regards to your coat there is not a bailment issue as you simply set it on the hook and did not hand it to a bailor therefore there is no duty of care attached to your coat. In regards to the gold coins you found they would likely be considered lost property as it appears to have been put in the wall of the buidling and forgotten about. The issue there is whether or not you have ownership rights to the coins. There is a case similar to this in which a chimney sweep found a valuable jewel, the ruling in that case states that right to lost property goes to the individual that found it or to the rightful owner. In other words, unless the rightful owner is found and notified of the gold coins you, and no one else, may retain the rights over that property. You should also realize that the brewery owners could have a competing interest in the gold coins that you found. A counterargument to you having ownership of the lost coins could be that they were infact not lost, but misplaced. There is a case where gold coins were found under a driveway and the ruling was that the land owner obtained ownership rights over the property. Therefore, the found property belongs to the owner of the land in which it was found, that being the brewery owners. C) Dear Alex, I enjoyed speaking with you earlier regarding the land you sold to David and Edward. When you sold the 5 acres to David he had a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. The condition subsequent rights over the property. Therefore, the found property belongs to the owner of the land in which it was found, that being the brewery owners. C) Dear Alex, I enjoyed speaking with you earlier regarding the land you sold to David and Edward. When you sold the 5 acres to David he had a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. The condition subsequent being that he never uses the property for anything but residential buildings. Additionally, your sons, Frank and Fred, had a contingent remainder in fee simple, because on the contingency that David used the land for anything but residential units they would acquire the land. Similar to David, Edward had a fee simple suject to condition subsequent, being that if he ever makes IPAs on the property he loses his right to ownership. You, Alex, had a reversion and right of re-entry, if Edward made IPAs on the land the ownership of the land would revert back to you. The contingent remainder that Frank and Fred had at the time of the sale of the land will allow them to take ownership of the land if or when David uses the land as anything other than residential units. You can use the deed to enforce the contigency of not being allowed to build commercial stores on the property to deter David from doing so. If David ignores that and continues his plan to build commercial stores Frank and Fred will obtain ownership rights of the 5 acres. Since Edward is already making IPAs on the property and by doing so has violated his contingent remainer in fee simple you may now enforce your reversion and right of re-entry and reclaim ownership of the 5-acres which include the warehouse. "," One issue in this case is, was the land adversely possessed by Debbie or her father, Chris? The rule here is that land will be adversely possessed if use of it extends past 10 years and use of the land is open and notorious, hostile, continuous, actual, and exclusive. Debbie's father, Chris, bought the property in 2001 which was 18 years before Betty discovered Greenacre to be one of her properties. Debbie could argue that when she moved to Greenacre in 2011 adverse possession of the property had taken place becuase between the ten years that her father lived their to when she overtook the property their use of the land was open/notorious, hostile, continuous, actual, and exclusive. Debbie could also argue that her father obtained the property and became a true owner of it under the color of title doctrine since he was unaware that Andrew forged Betty's 4name on the deed and was led to believe that everything was valid. The land was adversely possessed by Debbie and Chris in 2011, 10 years after Chris bought the land from Andrew, and therefore Debbie continues to have property rights over the Debbie could argue that when she moved to Greenacre in 2011 adverse possession of the property had taken place becuase between the ten years that her father lived their to when she overtook the property their use of the land was open/notorious, hostile, continuous, actual, and exclusive.

The land was adversely possessed by Debbie and Chris in 2011, 10 years after Chris bought the land from Andrew, and therefore Debbie continues to have property rights over the land. Another issue here would be is Betty entitled anything since she was Andrew's tenant by the entirety and ultimately did not agree to the selling of the land? Tenants by the entirety are able to be entitled to profits that come from the sale of land or property. Any decisions made regarding the property of tenants by the entirety must be expressely stated, and Andrew did not expressely tell Betty he was selling the property, or what her share of the profits were. Therefore Betty, being a tenant by entirety with Andrew, could argue that she is entititled to part of the profits from when the property was sold to Chris. Betty would be able to argue that since Andrew never expressely told her to make her aware of the sale of the property she is owed her share of the profits from that sale. A counter argument to this would be since Betty and Andrew never divorced she likely could have seen the profits from the sale either proir to or after his death. Betty could also argue that Debbie and Chris owe her money for living on her land like in the case of Martin v. Martin. However, a counter argument would be that Debbie and Chris lawfully adversely possessed and obtained the property and therefore do not owe Betty any payment. Betty most likely would argue that she is owed a type of payment for the sale and use of her land. ",232,932,559
74e85ddc-fc66-4e72-9351-28c4e77b8682," The first grandchildren of Oliver have a contigent remainder in life estate. Robert has a vested remainder in life estate. Victor has a vested remainder subject to partial divestment in fee simple. Vivian has a cintigent remainder in fee simple. The common law of rule against perpetuties is a doctrine that tries to stop a dead hand controll over property of the grantor well into the future and the common law states that the interest needs to vest within 21 years of the grant. This doctrine applies to executory interets, vestest ands contingent remainders. There needs to be a validating life or someone whos life is in being at the time of the grant that controlls wether the interest will vest or not. For the first interest the validating life are the childrens lifes. This does not violate RAP as they can fulfill the requirments at anytime during their lives. The second interest is that of Robert. His interest has already vested and therfore does not violate the RAP. The final interest is that of the grandchildren who reach the age of 25. This interest violates RAP because if Oliver has another child tomorrow and then died the following day that child's interest would not vest within the 21 year limit of RAP. In this situation the Rule of Convenience would apply as someone has already vested the interest in the land in fee simple. The rule of convenience is there to allow courts to best follow the meaning of the grantor and to meet his wishes. They would likely allow Victor and Vivian to keep their interests as they would vest withing the 21 year limit and then close off they remaining interets that could follow from other children. The rewritten language would say ""to the first of my children to retire, for life, then to my nephew robert for life"".) It would then revert back to Oliver's estate and follow the rules of intestacy. Courts do not wish to change to plain written langauge of wills and will do its best to follow the whishes of the grantor such as the rule of convenience. "," A.) Brock, the first issue before is us wether you and your brother have a tenancy in common or a joint tennacy, and how you could devide the land if necisssary. This law comes from the delfino v. vealencis case. In the deed that Alex signs he used ambiguous languange by saying that he grants the land jointly and as tenants in common. First in cases where the language is ambiguous courts generally lean towards granting tenancy in common. Tenants in common, and in your situation, have a percentage ownership value in the whole property. In this situation you both own 1/ the property. If this was a joint tenancy you would both have an undivded interest in the whole property. A joint tenancy also needs the 4 unities. The 4 unities are Possesion, Interest, Time, and Title.Since this is a tenancy in common you both have a right to use the whole property. This is further enforced since you paid a lump sum for half of the business and half od the wherhouse site. My first words of advice would to try and work things out with your brother, if that is not possible you may want to consider a parition. There are two types of partition. A partition in kind, and a partition by sale. In doctrine courts generally prefer a partition in kind, but in practice because they tend to lean more towards parition by sale. A parition in kind is where the courts will divide up the land equally among the tenants in common based upon how much each person owns. In this situation they court would devide the land based upon its value between the both of you in 1/2. A partition by sale is when the courts will sell the property in its entirety and then split the proceeds equally among you based upon the percentage you own, again 1/2. Since the courts generally prefer a partition in kind you have the burden in showing that a partition by sale is in the best interests of the parties involved. Looking at a partition in kind courts look to how hard it would be to seperate the property equally among the tenants and also how much emotional value the property holds to the tenant not wanting the partition. In this case where Alex has a significant interest in the land both financially and emotionally just as in the Delfino case where a woman had an emotionaly conection to her trash business it would be difficult to convince the court. He also has has a dream of owning a brewing company. You could argue that a parition in sale would be more preferable because since the property has the actual brewer, an on-site tasting room, and a warehouse it would be difficult to be able to divide the land equally among the both of. This is also added onto the fact that since the developer is offering more money than the property is worth, you may be able to argue that it is in the best interest of the parties to order a partition in sale where you can buy 7 your brother and sell the property. A court out would likely find that a partition in kind is more preferable even though the modern trend is towards a partition in kind because as a matter of policy courts want to reward hard work and dont want to take company. You could argue that a parition in sale would be more preferable because since the property has the actual brewer, an on-site tasting room, and a warehouse it would be difficult to be able to divide the land equally among the both of. This is also added onto the fact that since the developer is offering more money than the property is worth, you may be able to argue that it is in the best interest of the parties to order a partition in sale where you can buy out your brother and sell the property. A court would likely find that a partition in kind is more preferable even though the modern trend is towards a partition in kind because as a matter of policy courts want to reward hard work and dont want to take away property rights from people. Also they may want to protect the mercantalism of the brewing company over adding more buildings and protecting someones peroperty right to use their property to their own benifit. Finanlly, since Alex yelled at you and kicked you out you may be able to claim ouster from the property. Ouster is when one tenant kicks out another tenant who has a rightful claim to use the whole of the property. Alex cannot legally oust you from the premises. B.) Carl, the first issue is wether or not you have a legal property claim to the gold coins you picked up. In these situations we must ask outselves of few questions were the coins lost, mislaid, abanonded, imbedded, or considered treasure. If the coins were lost they would go to the finder. If they were mislaid they would go to the property owner. If they were abandoned they would go to the finder. If they were imbedded they would go to the property owner, and if they were considered a treasure trove, which courts dont readily recongnize, they go to the finder. In this situation where you were not treasspasing on the property since the brewery was open to the public as a commercial establishment you would have no trouble there. Today as a policy courts generally try to protect the rights of property owners from people tresspassing on their land to look for lost items. In this situtation where you pulled out a mesh bag from inside the wherehouse wall you could argue that since the gold coins were placed in a mesh bag inside such a wall they would be considered abanonded. In this situtation the coins would rightfully go to you. Brock and the brewery would likely argue that since the coins were placed in such a way including being wrapped and placed in a wall it was not lost and possibly imbedded or treasure. Imbedded property would go to the property owner and such the brewery. A court would likely find that the property was abandoned as it was only placed in a mesh bag from a grocery store and did not seem to be placed in such a way that would warrant giving it to the property owner as that condition is under the theory that the true owner who has a greater claim than everybody would come back for it, which seems unlikely in this situation. With respect to your Growler the issue is wether this was a bailment situation. A bailment is when someone who has possesion and a legal property right in something gives possesion to another without transfering title. This comes from a case involving the Hyatt Regency Hotel with a man who left his car seem to be placed in such a way that would warrant giving it to the property owner as that condition is under the theory that the true owner who has a greater claim than everybody would come back for it, which seems unlikely in this situation. With respect to your Growler the issue is wether this was a bailment situation. A bailment is when someone who has possesion and a legal property right in something gives possesion to another without transfering title. This comes from a case involving the Hyatt Regency Hotel with a man who left his car in a parking garage owned by the hotel. There are two types of bailments, an implied bailment, and a written or communicated bailment. In this situation you had a growler that you legally owned and you gave it to the bartender without transfering title of that object to the bartender. Additionally, the bartender gave you a ticket with a number on it that was attached to tag that was the same as the growler. To show a bailment you must show that the bailment was created when the bailor had possesion, control, and a duty of care to that object. In this situation where you were givin a ticket to account for the growler just like in the hyatt case where the man was givin a ticket while leaving the garage to pay for parking. Carl you would have to argue that since you were givin a ticket, you have possesion of your growler to the brewery, and a reasonable person would assume that they would give due care to your property as this was an implied bailment. The brewery would argue that the ticket was merely a way of identifying the owner of the growler or cup in other circumstances and this does not meet the requirments that courts have requested where in the Hyatt case they needed to show that it was a walled in garage with only one way in out out. They also did not charge you for taking the cup only using it to fill your beverage. A court would likely find that this was not a bailment as taking the cup was not a commercial enterprice but more of a conviencne and the ticket was only a way of identifying the owner not a way to charge the owner. With respect to your coat, you may try to argue another bailment situtation as explained above, but as no ticket was given to you for your coat and the rack was merely there to help you may have no claim against the brewery. If the coat was considered mislaid you would have a property right aginst all others with the brewery having a right over only subsequent finders. If the coat was lost, the finder would have a claim to keep the coat. C.) Alex, since you were sold the interest in the land and have the ability to sell, or devise the land in fee simple to whomever you choose. The deed to david gives David a fee simple subject to an executory limitation. Frank and Fred have a Executory interest in fee simple. The deed sated that David must use the the land for residential uses only. Since David in 7 is planning on building the residential as well 2017 as commercial stores, this may violate the interest in the deed and the executory interest will spring transfering the interest over to Frank and Fred. David would argue in court that the commercial stores a claim to keep the coat. C.) Alex, since you were sold the interest in the land and have the ability to sell, or devise the land in fee simple to whomever you choose. The deed to david gives David a fee simple subject to an executory limitation. Frank and Fred have a Executory interest in fee simple. The deed sated that David must use the the land for residential uses only. Since David in 2017 is planning on building the residential as well as commercial stores, this may violate the interest in the deed and the executory interest will spring transfering the interest over to Frank and Fred. David would argue in court that the commercial stores are generally apart of residential uses, while you would argue that as the language expressely stated that it must be used for residential purposes. A court would likely find that this violates the plain written language and you would win. The deed to Edward, the interest were that Edward had a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent with a right of reentry to Alex. This means that once Edward violates the condition in the deed and starts making IPAs such as he has done you have the right to reenter the property. To do this you must take substantial steps to reenter the property and it does not automatically go to you. These steps could include going to court and having them enforce the transfer. "," The issue here is who has the rightfull title and to which parts of greenacre. Betty was a Tenant by the Entirety with her husband Andrew which is similar to a joint tenancy where they have to have the 4 unities plus marriage. The 4 unities are Possesion, Interest, Time, and Title. When Andrew sold this property to Chris, Chris recieved a color of title. This means that he received a void title. To have a claim under a color of title you must be acting in good faith. It is important to note that Chris did not suspect anything. When Chris died, he left greenacre to his daughter debbie, who while receving a color of title also did not suspect anything and was acting in good faith towards that deed. When relying on a color of title you may only claim the land to which you have occupied. Betty would argue that since the deed selling the property was void she should have all the property. If the court belives a color of title defense then betty would argue that since Chris only used the cabin in the northeast corner of the land that should be the only track of land that should be claimed. She would also argue that since he did not use this property year round then he should not be able to claim any part. She would go on in saying that since the title has transferred to Debbie and she only uses the 2 acres where she build a year round house and that the only land that Debbie should be allowed to claim is that 2 acres. Betty would argue which that since he father Chris used the northeast corner he used for housing and he also walked around in the woods for long walks showing continuouse use. He also occupied the wooden house and would visit regularly throughout the year as a reasonable homeowner would. Debbie would go on to say that should be the only track of land that should be claimed. She would also argue that since he did not use this property year round then he should not be able to claim any part. She would go on in saying that since the title has transferred to Debbie and she only uses the 2 acres where she build a year round house and that the only land that Debbie should be allowed to claim is that 2 acres. Betty would argue that since he father Chris used the northeast corner which he used for housing and he also walked around in the woods for long walks showing continuouse use. He also occupied the wooden house and would visit regularly throughout the year as a reasonable homeowner would. Debbie would go on to say that since she build a home on the property on those two acres she should be entitles to that property as well. She would argue for the whole property, then the property containing the woods and the carbin her dad used, then if that also failed just for the 2 acres that she has been using. She would also bring up that since debbie has never visited the property she should be entitles to the whole thing. Depending on the statute in the area Debbie may also be able to claim adverse possesion of the entire property and would tack on her fathers time, while Betty would say the color of title voids the hostile element of adverse possesion. Finally, Betty would argue that as a Tenant by the Entirety with her husband he could not unilaterally sever that and as such the title transfer was also invalid. A court would likely find in favor of Debbie, as she was in good faith using her property under a color of title while Betty never visited the property before. Courts would also look to the reasonablness of the actors involved. Betty never visited the property before while Debbie and her father Chris were able to create substantial improvements on the property and used the land as good home owners would. Courts looks to benifit homeowners who best use their property while also trying to protect the property rights of the true owner. In this situation both Debbie and her father Chris used the home as reasonable owners would they allow their neighbors to come on the proberty to hunt only allowing them on with their permission, Debbie has planted flowers and a garden. She build a new home which she lives in year round compared to Betty who has never visited. ",356,2004,764
28504c8c-3925-43dc-9af1-0d1aee0cc6ce," Oliver's grant gave Connor and Carla a contingent remainder in a life estate. Their remainder is contingent because it is dependent on which of Oliver's kids retires first and if Oliver has more children. The grant gives Robert a vested remainder in a life estate because there are no conditions attached to it and Robert is an ascertained person.The grant also gave Victor a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple because Victor has already satisfied the condition (that he reach the age of 25) and the class might expand (for example, when Vivian reaches 25). Vivian has a contingent remainder in fee simple because she has not yet satisfied the conditon in the will. At the time of the grant, Oliver maintains a possessory interest in fee simple because neither of his children have yet retired. Next we must analyze the grant under the common law rule of perpetuities. The rule states that an interest must vest of fail to vest within 21 years of a life in being at the time of the grant. Right off the bat we can see that Robert's interest is valid under the rule because it is already vested, Robert will get the estate as soon as whichever one of Oliver's kids to retire first dies. The contingent remainder in life estate that Connor and Carla possess is invalid under the rule against perpetuities. This is because Oliver is still alive. Oliver can have another kid after the creation of the grant, then Oliver, Connor, and Carla can all die the next day, then the child can lead an ordinary life and retire many years later (or even retire young at the age of 22). Because of that, we cannot know whether the interest will vest or fail to vest within 21 years after a life in being at the creation of the grant. The grant ""to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25"" is also invalid under the rule. This is because Connor (or Carla) can have a kid after the creation of the grant, then everybody else dies, and then the infant must wait 25 years before the interest vests. However, under the rule of convienence, which allows vested remainders subject to open which otherwise fail the rule against perpetuities to be upheld, Victor will be able to keep his grant. This is because Victor's remainder is already vested (he has already reached the age of 25). Vivian, however, is out of luck. A new grant, striking out the void provisions, would read: ""to my nephew Robert for life, then to Victor. infant must wait 25 years before the interest vests. However, under the rule of convienence, which allows vested remainders subject to open which otherwise fail the rule against perpetuities to be upheld, Victor will be able to keep his grant. This is because Victor's remainder is already vested (he has already reached the age of 25). Vivian, however, is out of luck. A new grant, striking out the void provisions, would read: ""to my nephew Robert for life, then to Victor. "," Brock's issue is whether or not he will be able to sell his interest in the property to the developer unilaterally or if he will be able to force a partition by sale. Alex and Brock own the brewery and the 10 acre plot it is located on in fee simple absolute as tenants in common. This means that both Alex and Brock have full rights to enjoy the use of the entire property, to extract rents, and must pay carrying costs. Brock is able to sell his interest, but whoever he sells it to will also be a tenant in common with Alex. Therefore, it is unlikely that the developer will be interested in buying only Brock's interest, because they want the property for purposes of land development, which Alex can prevent from happening since he has the right to enjoy the entire property. Brock's best bet would be to ask the court for a partition by sale. This would allow him to buy Alex's interest outright, at which point he can sell the entire property to the developer in fee simple. However, courts are reluctant to grant partitions by sale and the default is instead towards a partition in kind (literally splitting up the plot). A court is more likely to grant a partition by sale if 1) it is not practicle to divide the land equitably 2) a partition by sale materially benefits one of the current owners and 3) a partion by sale does not place an unjust burden on the other tenant. Brock should not have a hard time proving number 1 because the layout of the property does indeed make it impractible to divide the land equitably. This is because the brewery is located on the corner of a ten acre lot. Brock could argue that a partition in kind would result in one lot which contains the brewery and another which does not, or two lots that contain half a brewery (which is not tenable). Number 2 is also an easy one for Brock, since the sale of the property would clearly benefit him financially. Three is a bit more difficult but Brock may argue that his Brother is not unduly burdened by a partition by because he can simply move the brewery a few miles down the road. Arguing that a partition by sale places an unjust burden on him is Alex's best bet if he want to stop a partition by sale from happening. Alex can argue along the lines of Delfino that he has an emotional attachment to the3 brewery. In Delfino the owner of a garbage dump was successfully able to block partition by sale because of the fact that they had inherited the business from the grandfather and the family had operated the garbage dump for decades. Alex can argue since the sale of the property would clearly benefit him financially. Three is a bit more difficult but Brock may argue that his Brother is not unduly burdened by a partition by because he can simply move the brewery a few miles down the road. Arguing that a partition by sale places an unjust burden on him is Alex's best bet if he want to stop a partition by sale from happening. Alex can argue along the lines of Delfino that he has an emotional attachment to the brewery. In Delfino the owner of a garbage dump was successfully able to block partition by sale because of the fact that they had inherited the business from the grandfather and the family had operated the garbage dump for decades. Alex can argue that because of the years of hard work he has put in his business (not only on site, but the years of apprenticeship and dreaming of opening a brewery), he has a sentimental and emotional reasons for keeping the property. He can argue that, although he can move the business, he has such an emotional attachment to the current site that it would be unconscionable to force him to leave. It is a close call in the end. But I think that the court will order a partition by sale. This mostly due to the difficulty in dividing the plot equitably. Alex's argument, that he has such an emotional attachment to the land, will probably not carry the day because, in the end, the facts are crucially different than Delfino since Alex has only operated the brewery for four years. Finally, although it is true that there is a common law preference for partions in kind, in practice courts are more likely to order partitions by sale because of the difficulty inherent in dividing plots of land. If the court does not buy Brock's argument and denies the partition by sale, Brock can ask for a partition in kind. He can then attempt to sell his plot (which he now owns in fee simple) to the developer. Although the developer will likely offer less money for just Brock's portion of the plot than it would have for both, or may not even be interested in just Brock's half. 3) The Coins The legal issue surrounding the coins is whether or not Carl, the finder, has a better claim to the coins than Alex/Brock, the owners of the property in which the coins were found. The rules regarding found items are: lost items go to the finder, mislaid items go to the landowner, and treasure troves also go to the finder. Therefore, the relevant question to ask is which of those categories do the coins count as? An item is lost if the true owner leaves it someplace without knowing that they left it there. For example, if you are walking down the street and your watch falls off your hand without you noticing, your watch is lost. The finder of a lost item gets to keep the item and obtains title that is good against everyone than Alex/Brock, the owners of the property in which the coins were found. The rules regarding found items are: lost items go to the finder, mislaid items go to the landowner, and treasure troves also go to the finder. Therefore, the relevant question to ask is which of those categories do the coins count as? An item is lost if the true owner leaves it someplace without knowing that they left it there. For example, if you are walking down the street and your watch falls off your hand without you noticing, your watch is lost. The finder of a lost item gets to keep the item and obtains title that is good against everyone except the original owner. By contrast, an item is mislaid when a person intentionally places it somewhere and then either forgets about it or never comes back to retrieve the item. The key difference between lost and mislaid is intentionally. A mislaid item goes to the owner of the property where teh item was found. The policy reason for this is that whoever mislaid the item is more likely to go back to where they have mislaid it than to go through the trouble of finding the finder. Finally, an item may be in treasure trove. This is the rarest of the three because items in trove must be very very old. An item found in trove goes to the finder, not the landowner. Items can also be abandonded, but this requires the intent on behalf of the true owner, and the fact that the coins were carefully wrapped and hidden strongly suggests that they were not abandonded The facts of this case are most similar to one which took place in California where an airplane mechanic, while working on a plane in his employer's hanger, found that the interior of the plane (behind the paneling on the walls of the cabin) was laid with packets of money that was printed a few decades prior (leading to the assumption that the money had been in the plane all that time). The court in that case found that the money was mislaid, since it was clear that the money was intentionally placed inside the plane. The mislaid money ended up going to the mechanic's employer. Here, the fact that the coins were wrapped in a mesh shopping bag and placed inside a wall (i.e. not simply dropped on the floor) will lead the court to decide that the coins are mislaid property and that they should go to Alex and Brock as owners of the property in which they were found. Carl's can argue that the coins were lost, but he will probably lose for the same reasons described above. Additionally, he will lose the argument that the coins were abandonded because of the fact that they are inside the bag. Carl's best argument is that the coins are in trove. This would allow him to the keep the coins, he can look to the age of the coins as evidence in support of that argument. Ultimately though, Carl will also lose that argument, since the shopping bag in which the coins were placed is from a store which is only 10 years old. That is not nearly enough time for an item to go from being mislaid to being trove. The Growler they are inside the bag. Carl's best argument is that the coins are in trove. This would allow him to the keep the coins, he can look to the age of the coins as evidence in support of that argument. Ultimately though, Carl will also lose that argument, since the shopping bag in which the coins were placed is from a store which is only 10 years old. That is not nearly enough time for an item to go from being mislaid to being trove. The Growler The legal issue with Carl's growler is whether or not his giving it to the bartender created a bailment. A bailment creates a duty of care in the bailee and thus a bailee can be liable if the item they are in care of is damaged. This situation is most analogous to the case where a man left his car in an enclosed parking garage, which was under surveilance, and had a clerk at the gate only to have his car stolen. In that case, the court found that a bailment had been created when the man left his car in the garage and the owners of the garage were therefore liable. Carl will want to argue that his giving the growler to the bartender and especially the fact that the bartender then gave him an identifying ticket while placing a matching ticket on his growler, created a bailment. The brewery will of course argue that no bailment was created, drawing a distinction from the case law based on the fact that growler was not under care by the bartender but merely in his possession to put beer into i.e. the bartender was not tasked with looking after the growler at all. Carl will also be unable to recover for his lost growler because the ticket alone is not enough to create a bailment. The Coat The legal issue with the Coat is again whether or not Carl lost it, mislaid it, or abandonded it. The coat is mislaid because Carl intentionally hung it on the rack, only to later be unable to find it. In this case however, Carl will be able to recover the coat (if he/the police/ the brewery ever find it) because Carl is the coat's true owner. If for example, the next day another customer of the brewery finds the coat hanging on the rack, the brewery will take possession of it and Carl will be able to go back to the brewery and assert his superior title. 4) 1C Alex, There are two legal issues that must be discussed here. One is who owns what interests in this property brewery and assert his superior title. 4) 1C Alex, There are two legal issues that must be discussed here. One is who owns what interests in this property (what interests did your sales create) and the other is what, if any, recourse can you get from David and Edward. First, when Brock sold his land back to you in 2006 you owned the land in fee simple absolute as the sole owner, the entire property was yours. In 2016 you completed two separate sales of the property, dividing it into two plots. The first sale, to David Developer, gave David the estate in Fee simple subject to executory interest. A fee simple subj. to executory interest is an estate which may be passed on to heirs but to which a condition is attached that could automatically entirely remove the estate from the grantee's possession and into the hands of another. In this case, the language ""so long as used for residential uses only"" is pertinent. The next part of that grant, ""if it is ever used for non-residential purposes, to my two sons Frank and Fred"" gave your sons an executory interest in fee simple absolute. In other words, the property will become theirs if it is ever used for non-residential purposes. We will discuss the implications of this below. The other sale you made, to Edward, created a fee simple determinable in the brewery and five acres it is on. A fee simple determinable is a type of estate, similar to a fee simple subj to executory interest, that can be lost if a certain event happens. The difference between the two is that the determinable is followed by a possibility of reverter, which automatically gives the estate back to the grantor (rather than a grantee in an executory interest) if the condition is broken. Your sale to Edward gave you a possibilty of reverter. Now we can look at your possibilities here. With regards to you and David, you yourself will not be able to take the property back. However, your sons will. You can argue David has clearly broken the condition in the original grant by making plans to build a mixed-use development. An executory interest is automatic, that is, when David breaks the rules you made, the property will automatically go to your sons. David's argument against this will be that he has not technically broken the grant yet, since he is only planning on building non-residential buildings and has not actually done so. David's argument is probably the stronger of the two but that does not mean David is safe. If the land is indeed used for Now we can look at your possibilities here. With regards to you and David, you yourself will not be able to take the property back. However, your sons will. You can argue David has clearly broken the condition in the original grant by making plans to build a mixed-use development. An executory interest is automatic, that is, when David breaks the rules you made, the property will automatically go to your sons. David's argument against this will be that he has not technically broken the grant yet, since he is only planning on building non-residential buildings and has not actually done so. David's argument is probably the stronger of the two but that does not mean David is safe. If the land is indeed used for non-residential purposes the executory interest your sons have will transform into a fee simple absolute (they will own the land outright). Next, we can examine your claim with regards to Edward. Normally, this would be an open and shut case, the language ""to Edward, so long as the premises are never used to make IPAs"" creates a fee simple determinable for Edward and a possibility of reverter for you. That means that, if Edward ever makes IPA's, which he has, the property will 'revert' back to you and you will once again own the brewery. However, the additional language of the grant, ""Alex has the right to re-enter and reclaim the premises"" creates ambiguity. That language indicates a right of entry, which follows a fee simple subject to conditon subsequent. Edward's argument will undoubtably be that that language gave him a fee simple subj. to condition subsequent rather than a fee simple determinable. The difference here is that a right of entry merely gives you the right to retake your property, you must assert that right yourself ( a possibility of rever, on the other hand, is automatic). In the end, I believe that the court will find a possibility of reverter because of the use fo the words 'so long as'. Your case is similar to Marenholtz School District (which dealt with a similarly worded grant). The court in that case found a fee simple determinable was created by use of the word 'only'-- the key to finding a fee simple determinable is the use of words in the grant that indicate time. 'So long as' clearly implicates time, the language giving you a right of entry is therefore irrelevant and the court will be unlikely to put much weight on it, especially because it was written by a layman who has not had time to learn the intricacies of estates and future interests. As far as the property goes, Edward has broken the terms of the deed and therefore the property is now once again yourse 5) "," The issue at hand is simple, ""who owns greenacre?"" Of course, this question raises numerous smaller legal issues. First, was the sale of Greenacre from Andrew to Chris valid? Andrew and Betty owned greenacre as tenants by the entirety. That means that they each enjoyed the right to the whole use of the property as 5) 2. The issue at hand is simple, ""who owns greenacre?"" Of course, this question raises numerous smaller legal issues. First, was the sale of Greenacre from Andrew to Chris valid? Andrew and Betty owned greenacre as tenants by the entirety. That means that they each enjoyed the right to the whole use of the property as well as the right of survivorship. Crucially important here is that, unlike a joint tenancy, a tenancy in the entirety cannot be unilaterally severed. That means that the sale made by Andrew, unknown to his wife, is invalid. Therefore the proper title of Greenacre belongs to Betty, who owns the entire property in fee simple after Andrew's death. Next, we must determine if Chris and Debbie acquired the land through adverse possession. Adverse possession requires five elements that must be satisfied. These are 1) the adverse possessor must be in actual possession of the land 2) the possession must be open and notorious 3) the possession must be hostile 4) the possession must be exclusive and 5) the possession must be continuous for the statutory period (in New Suffolk, 10 years). In certain jurisdictions, a party must be acting in good faith in order to adversly possess (as happened here, since Chris thought he had purchased the land himself), in a minority of states (such as Maine) the opposite is true and a party must act in bad faith. First, we must determine if Chris and Debbie were in actual possession of the land. Actual possession simply means that the party attempting to gain title through adverse possession has the property. Since Chris and later Debbie have been making use of the land including the creation of improvements (enlarging the cabin, the house), and Andrew and Betty appear not to have gone it since at least 2001, it seems clear that Chris/Debbie satisfy that element of adverse possession. In fact, Betty does not have much of an argument against this element, it is clear that Debbie is currently in possession of Greenacre since she lives there and is sitting on the porch Second, we must see if Chris and Debbies possession is open and notorious. That simply means that others are able to see the possession. Debbie will argue that her father, and later her, satisfy this element because other people knew they were on the land. In fact, Chris allowed neighbors onto the land frequently, which means the neighbors must have seen Chris there. Additionally, the cabin and later house were not at all hidden from public view. Betty will argue that, because she didn't know about any of this, the possession was not open and notorious. This is a misreading of the rule and the courts have determined that it does not matter whether the owner actually knew of the adverse possession but Second, we must see if Chris and Debbies possession is open and notorious. That simply means that others are able to see the possession. Debbie will argue that her father, and later her, satisfy this element because other people knew they were on the land. In fact, Chris allowed neighbors onto the land frequently, which means the neighbors must have seen Chris there. Additionally, the cabin and later house were not at all hidden from public view. Betty will argue that, because she didn't know about any of this, the possession was not open and notorious. This is a misreading of the rule and the courts have determined that it does not matter whether the owner actually knew of the adverse possession but whether or not they could have easily or should have known. Therefore, Debbie satifies this element. Third, we must look at the hostility of the possession. This simply means that the person in possession is holding it oppossed to another claim without their permission.That is clearly the case here, since Betty own's the actual deed to the land and Debbie owns another deed and Debbie did not allow anyone onto Greenacre. Next we look to exclusivity. This means that no other possessor possessed the land during the statutory period. Betty will argue that, because Chris allowd hunters to frequently go across the land, the possession was not exclusive. This is another misread of the rule, adverse possessors are allowed to invite guests onto the land. Debbie and Chris also satisfy this element. Finally, we must look to see whether the use by Chris and Debbie was continuous for the statutory period. Land use is continuous if the adverse possessor is using the land as a true owner would, for the entire requisite period. Here, Debbie runs into trouble because her father only used the land for 2 months out of the year. Betty will argue that this does not count as continuous use and will point to the fact that neighbors were using the land to hunt during the other ten months of the year to indicate that Chris was not acting as a true owner (since other owners in the area were indeed thre year-round). Debbie must argue that Chris' use of the land was indeed continuous because he acted as a true owner would. She can point to the fact that Chris' use of the land was the same as Andrew's and that it is unreasonable to expect a person to live at 'a rustic camp' for more than two months of the year. Debbie, on the other hand, lives at the new house year round and therefore is clearly continuous. This is Betty's strongest argument to fight Debbies adverse possession claim. If the court finds that the land use was continuous then the relevant statutory period ended in 2011 and Betty cannot recover the land. Debbie is allowed to start counting from Chris' possession because he conveyed the land to her in privity through his will. If the court finds that Chris' use was not continuous Debbie must start counting from 2011, when she moved to Greenacre full time (she can argue in court to start the date at 2009, but if the court has already found Chris' use not to be continuous10she will lose that argument) and she will lose the adverse possession case because ten years has not passed. continuous then the relevant statutory period ended in 2011 and Betty cannot recover the land. Debbie is allowed to start counting from Chris' possession because he conveyed the land to her in privity through his will. If the court finds that Chris' use was not continuous Debbie must start counting from 2011, when she moved to Greenacre full time (she can argue in court to start the date at 2009, but if the court has already found Chris' use not to be continuous she will lose that argument) and she will lose the adverse possession case because ten years has not passed. Finally, if Debbie wins her adverse possession case, she will be able to take possession of all of Greenacre because her father obtained it under color of title. Color of title means that the adverse possessor was acting in accordance with a false deed (which is what happened here). A possessor acting under color of title may take the entire parcel of land which they are adversely possessing, rather than only the parts they used (which is the standard sans color of title). Ultimately, I think that the court will find in favor of Betty because they will be not be convinced that Chris' use of the property was continuous. It is a close call but the presence of other neighbors in the area while Chris was not there indicates that he was not acting as a true owner would. However it is a close call. ",514,2895,1342
745809f5-cf52-4c7d-8fd8-123958cdf815," Oliver has a fee simple subject to executory statutory limitations (a present possessory interest). A fee simple subject to executory statutory limitations is present in a will if there is a condition to be met by one of the future interests, but none of the future interests have met those conditions yet. In this case, this is present as neither Connor or Carla can retire and take the land as they both are working full time but there is a future chance or possibility that they will be owners. When Carla or Connor do retire, they would have a present possessory interest or a fee simple pur autre vie of the life of Oliver. However in the current will/deed, Connor and Carla both have indefeasibly vested remainders, as there is only Connor or Carla, who as Oliver's children can take the land. The grandchildren Victor and Vivian are executory interests as they have to wait for the life of Connor and Carla to pass/end to then take ownership of the land. RAP is void for some of interests here. RAP is not void for Connor or Carla, although they are both vested remainders, in which RAP applies, it is concievable that either one of them would take the land within the 21 year time frame. RAP is void for Connor and Carla, as RAP applies to exectory interests, and the interest would fail to be vested within the 21 year time frame. As such the court would strike the grant to say: Oliver Owner grants his property ""to the first of my children to retire, for life, then to my nephew Robert for life"" to fix the language of the grant and avoid confusion and dead hand control. There also is a possibility that if at the time Connor and Carla retire at the same time that they would become joint tenants. In this case of joint tenancy, if Connor dies later his ownership rights would go to Carla, as joint tenancy has the unique feature of right of survivorship whereby an interest interests is given to the remaining interest. If Carla dies but Connor lives, her ownership rights would go to Connor due to right of survivorship. "," Long Answer #1 1a) For Brock his ability to ""make some money from this developer"" is dependant on a few different options. Brock is a joint tenant and owns 50% of the property. Because Brock has a tenancy in common with Alex, Brock could go to Alex and convince Alex that selling the property would be the best for both of them and the property could be sold to the developer. However as past efforts to sell the property have gone astray, Brock would have to turn to other options. Brock should avoid violating the four unities in a joint tenancy: time, title, interest and possession as any violation of one of these unities will result in a change in the state of the property. Brock could offer his portion of the property for sale for the developers, the developer would get 50% of the property and build on the 50% of the property while Alex would keep his 50% share of the property. But this is problematic, as in seen Delfino v Velancois, where a sale of the land was ruled to not be valid as it the court's judgement did not consider the value of the property alongside the owners best interests, as cutting and selling the land in half would bring major economic damage to Alex, as Alex's well being and business is based on having enough space and a working brewery to sell beer, and only benefits Brock who simply wants to sell the land, take the money to ultimatelty get out of the beer business. As a third option, Brock could buy the share from Alex and then sell the entire property to the developer but this is unlikely since Alex's behavior is showing that Alex wants to keep the property at all costs. 1b) For Carl concerning the gold coins, there is a chance and not a chance that Carl himself has claims to the gold coins. In regards to the gold coins, title or ownership of the gold coins is dependent on what the type of property is under finders law. In finder law there are four different types of property: Abandoned, lost, mislaid or treasure trove. Abandoned property is property that the original owner has left behind and is not coming back for. For Carls case, the gold coins could be abandoned property as the coins were from the original grocery store that left the gold coins there and never came back for them, as the grocery store never came back for the coins after the grocery left after 10 years. Mislaid property is property that is dropped on the floor and forgotten by the owner but the owner will come back for it. For the counterargument against Carl's titles to the coins, the gold coins are mislaid property as the gold coins were placed on the floor and the grocery store forgot where the coins were. If the gold Abandoned, lost, mislaid or treasure trove. Abandoned property is property that the original owner has left behind and is not coming back for. For Carls case, the gold coins could be abandoned property as the coins were from the original grocery store that left the gold coins there and never came back for them, as the grocery store never came back for the coins after the grocery left after 10 years. Mislaid property is property that is dropped on the floor and forgotten by the owner but the owner will come back for it. For the counterargument against Carl's titles to the coins, the gold coins are mislaid property as the gold coins were placed on the floor and the grocery store forgot where the coins were. If the gold coins are mislaid property then, like McAvoy v Medina, where a mislaid property was ruled not to be the possession of the finder but instead the store owner until the actual owner took possession, they are the property of Alex and Brock. Treasure trove is property that is a treasure such as antigues in which the finder of the treasure is entitled to possession of the property.Carl could argue that the gold coins are instead treasure trove property as gold coins fit the category of treasure trove and he was the first to find it. In a counter arguement, a minority ruling such as in Corliss v Weinner, the gold coins could be claimed as property embedded. Embedded property is property that is buried in the ground and belongs to the owner of the property where the property is found regardless of who the finder is. The gold coins could be convieved as embedded property as they were hidding in the wall and as such would belong to Alex and Brock. Another counterarguement for the gold coins is that the gold coins could be argued as lost property. Lost property is property when the original owner has lost or forgotten where the property is but is still entitled to the property. The orginal grocery store lost the gold coins and as such is entitled to the master claim of the gold coins regardless if Carl found them. For Carl's growler, Carl has a legal defense if a bailment was present. A bailment is a temporary transfer of property rights from the orginal owner; bailor to the bailee. In the case of Allen v Hyatt Regency Hotels Inc., a partial bailment of property was enough through a parking ticket/claim, alongside four walls and a parking attendant or employee to get monetary relief for property lost due to a bailment. For Carl's case, a partial bailment was present when he recieved a claim ticket from the employee in a brewery taste room that had four walls and a roof and Carl is entitled to monetary relief. A counter argument is the dissenting opinion in Allen v Hyatt Regency Hotels Inc that a complete bailment is needed for monetary relief to be granted. A complete bailment for Carl would have been giving the growler to the employee and walking away. However, it is easily concieveable that this is not the case as there was enough bailment when the growler was transferred to the employee. For the coat, an arguement for a bailment could be used to support Carl's claims as the brewery was a structure that had four walls and a roof with employees regualrlky checking the rooms of the brewery for trouble. However Alex and Brock could counter argue with the argument, such as in Ghen v Rich, that a custom that works well in practice should be maintained and upheld for the best interests of society, that the needed for monetary relief to be granted. A complete bailment for Carl would have been giving the growler to the employee and walking away. However, it is easily concieveable that this is not the case as there was enough bailment when the growler was transferred to the employee. For the coat, an arguement for a bailment could be used to support Carl's claims as the brewery was a structure that had four walls and a roof with employees regualrlky checking the rooms of the brewery for trouble. However Alex and Brock could counter argue with the argument, such as in Ghen v Rich, that a custom that works well in practice should be maintained and upheld for the best interests of society, that the coat check is a system that is based on hoping that another individual will not come and take your coat and in the past that other people have taken other peoples coats and as such as providing monetary relief for the system that works well with coat hangers when you a enter a place will ruin or hurt society. 1c) When Alex decided to divide the property, the following interests concerning the deed are that David Developer had a fee simple subject to condition subsequent , indicated by the language 'if it is ever used...then to' followed by an executory interests in Frank and Fred, as Frank and Fred are third parties who are going to take the land if David Developer violates those conditions, Alex has no remaining claims or rights for the property. RAP applies to Frank and Freds interestes since RAP applies to executory interests and both Frank and Fred are executory interests. RAP could be void as it could be more than 21 years for Frank or Fred to obtain the property from David Developer. However the RAP is likely valid if David Developer has violated the condition with building residental units and commercial stores (commercial stores not being the deed). Since David Developer breached or violated the condition that the land is being used for non-residential conditions the land could fall in the hands of Frank or Fred. But David Developer could raise the defense that it was using the land within the agreed upon conditions in the will citing Marenholz v. School County Boards. In Marenholz, a executory interests or future person to take the land, argued that because a condition to use the land was not being met, the land would fall to the future person. The Marenholz court held that the land was being used on the agreed upon condition based on a loose interpretation of what terms were devised. Because David Developer was using the land for some or partial residental purposes, David Developer could keep ownership of the land. David Developer could argue as well that ground floor commercial stores were part of residental living and as such did not violate such conditions. When Alex decided to divide the property, the following interests concerning the deed are that Edward is subject to a fee simple determinable, hence the language ""so long as"" with Alex having a possibility of a revertor as the language states the land will go to Alex if the condition is violated by Edward. Edward has a direct violation of the language as he has been brewing IPA's when he shouldn't have been so Alex can use his possibility of revertor and take the land. But Edward could raise the defense of adverse possession as it appears Edward has filled the five requirements: Open/notorious, Continuous, part of residental living and as such did not violate such conditions.

Edward has a direct violation of the language as he has been brewing IPA's when he shouldn't have been so Alex can use his possibility of revertor and take the land. But Edward could raise the defense of adverse possession as it appears Edward has filled the five requirements: Open/notorious, Continuous, Exclusive, Actual, and Hostile alongside the fact that Edward has fulfilled the 10 year, a majority state rule, time of ownership of the land. Edward has fulfilled continuous because Edward uses the land daily to brew beer. Edward has fulfilled Open and Notorious because a reasonable person from an objective viewpoint would upon inspection see that someone owns the property. Edward has fulfilled actual because he is actually or literally using the property. Edward could also claim that he acted in good faith as he had a reasonable belief that the land he owned was his and treated the land as the true owner would. Alex could not raise the bad faith requirement here, as in Dombkowski v. Ferland, as the property was transferred or conveyed to Edward. Edward has fulfilled exclusive because Edward controls which people can enter the property such as the brewery workers. Edward has fulfilled hostile because he has a made a plan or defense to keep owning the land. "," Long Answer #2 or 2a) Betty has possession of the land through claim of title and potentially using the waste doctrine on Debbie's actions. Betty was tenancy in entirety with her husband Andrew for ownership of the 50 acre land. When Andrew died in 2004, the full property rights shifted to Debbie. Therefore Betty can claim that she is the true owner of the property and has the right to exclude or remove Debbie from the land. Betty can use the right of exclusion, as in Jacques v. Steelberg Mobile Homes ruling that property owners have a right to exclusion from others especially for financial gain, as Debbie's taking of the 2 acres could be construed as being motivated as a financial gain. Betty could also remove Debbie from the land using the doctrine of waste defense. Doctrine of waste permits financial or land retaking if waste has occured in: affirmative waste, permissive waste or ameliorative waste. Debbie cleared trees and created a garden within 2 acres of the land. Debbie clearing the trees could be claimed as affirmative waste as the clearing of the trees could create significant monetary damage to the existing overall could property value of the land. Debbie clearing the trees 8 be claimed as permissive waste as it could be argued that Debbie let the 2 acre land of trees simply get out of control, out of neglect, and then was forced to clear the trees from the land. Although Debbie put in a house and a lovely garden that could the land using the doctrine of waste defense. Doctrine of waste permits financial or land retaking if waste has occured in: affirmative waste, permissive waste or ameliorative waste. Debbie cleared trees and created a garden within 2 acres of the land. Debbie clearing the trees could be claimed as affirmative waste as the clearing of the trees could create significant monetary damage to the existing overall property value of the land. Debbie clearing the trees could be claimed as permissive waste as it could be argued that Debbie let the 2 acre land of trees simply get out of control, out of neglect, and then was forced to clear the trees from the land. Although Debbie put in a house and a lovely garden that could raise the value of the land, courts would rule that this was ameilorative waste, as the waste made the land better but still involved waste. If taken to court on the waste, Debbie could claim a defense, from the Jackson v Browning case, where a individual who occupied the land removed trees for another property usage was not liable for paying monetary damages, especially if Debbie claims that she acted in good faith. Betty could put a claim in the defense of Hickeringill v Keeble, claiming that Debbie's actions of taking the land is a malicious interference for Betty's overall enjoyment or violates Betty's bundle of property rights. But Debbie would argue that malicious interference was not present as the neighbors are allowed to use the land for hunting purposes or for game which could be better for society. Debbies actions are a malicious interference that provide zero economic or societal benefits. Betty could put in a defense of fugutive resources arguing that Debbie acted irrational and in the act of clearing the trees did so in a manner that involved misusing limited natural resources. Debbies clearing of the trees invokes the dangers that emerge from the tragedy of the commons concept which could invite future destruction of limited natural resources for the 50 acre land from cutting down more or almost all of the trees from the 50 acre property. Debbie would follow with a counterclaim, which would not work, in the Eyerman v Merchantile Co., on the right to destory property on the will rights, as Betty would argue that Betty the true owner of the property was one person who could control the land. Debbie would also follow with a counterclaim, arguing in Wetherbee v Green ruling that acting in good faith gives you possession of property that has been improved in economic value, that Debbie acted in a good faith, with the belief that she owned the land and had a right to destory the land and as such cutting down the trees into something of a higher property value and as such is entitled to keep the house. This would have potentially occurred when Debbie took the trees converted them into logs, timber or lumber to create an element of her house such as the walls, foundational structure, doors, etc. Debbie has merits of legal claims for the property possibly through adverse possession. Adverse Possession requires five elements to be met: open/notorious, hostile, exclusive, actual and continuous around 10-15 years. Debbie fulfills the alongside a certain period of time of ownership typically continuous element, continuous defined as treating the property usage as an true owner would, when she builds a house as well as visits and enjoys use of the house. Debbie fulfills the hostile element when potentially occurred when Debbie took the trees converted them into logs, timber or lumber to create an element of her house such as the walls, foundational structure, doors, etc. Debbie has merits of legal claims for the property possibly through adverse possession. Adverse Possession requires five elements to be met: open/notorious, hostile, exclusive, actual and continuous alongside a certain period of time of ownership typically around 10-15 years. Debbie fulfills the continuous element, continuous defined as treating the property usage as an true owner would, when she builds a house as well as visits and enjoys use of the house. Debbie fulfills the hostile element when she believes she has a valid claim or title to her two acres of the land. Debbie has fulfilled the open/notorious aspect, open/notorious being defined as a what a reasonable person inspecting the property would see signs that someone would be living on the property from an objective standard, when her house is present or visiable to the public eye on the land. Debbie fulfills the exclusive element, exclusive being defined as controlling or limiting who enters or can use the property, when she limits who can enter and use her property such as limiting the neighbors to use the land but only for hunting reasons or when she keeps the property to herself. Debbie fulfills the actual element, actual being the Adverse possessor is actually using the property, because she has a frequent pattern of using the property. Most states follow the majority rule which is a reasonable objective standard meaning that the mindset of the Adverse Possessor is irrelevant for the actual element and as such this has been met. Debbie has fulfilled the good faith actual element as Debbie has believed that she had an a honest belief that she owned the land. Debbie has fulfilled the bad faith actual element, in Dombkowski v. Ferland, as she took the land despite knowing that there was a true owner to the land. Debbie has fulfilled the state statutory requirement as it has been more than 10 years since 2001 when the land was changed. Debbie can use adverse possession as a defense to the color of title issue that occurred when Andrew forged Betty's name on the deed. Using Adverse Possession as a color of title defense would give Debbie the right to the 2 acres that she has been using only. ",368,1978,1244
456934c5-9965-4648-8d24-2d877fc88e2f," The first issue to be determined if whether or not this devising of property is a will or a deed. To interpret this, the court will look to lanague used by Oliver Owner. Since he used the phrase ""grants"" it is considered a will. This is important because it depicts at what time the interest will take effect. With a will, the interest take into effect at the death of the testor. Since the problem does not specify, we will assume Oliver has passed away. If Oliver was alive, he would have a present possessory interest in fee simple. The grant gives interets in the following: The children of Oliver, Connor and Carla have a life estate subject to condition subsquent. This is a defeasible fee, meaning, before they are able to active their interest in the property, they have to meet a condition which in this case would be to retire. Whomever retires first will be granted the estate for their life. Robert would have a vested remainder in life estate. Since Robert does not have to do anything to divest or cut short the interest before his, as a remainder he just have to sit patiently and wait for whomever Conner or Carla to die before his interest in the estate can vest. Oliver's grandchild Victor, would have a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple. Since Victor is already 26, he has satisfied to condition his grandfather wrote in the grant which was meeting the age requirement of 25. His interest is still subject to open because he is part of a class. A class is a group of indidviduals where another life controls the class. In this case the class in grandchild and the class will be open until either Carla or Conner pass, at that point there can be no more children making the class close. and lastly Oliver's granchild Vivian would have a contingent remainder in fee simple. Unlike her brother, Vivi's interst is a contingent remiander because she although she is an ascertained person she has not met condition expressly stated in the grrant to obtain interest. The next issue to be determined is whether or not any of these interets violate the Rule against Perpetuities, RAP. RAP is a common law appraoch where the court determines whether or not certain interets will STILL be contingent or not in a life and being +21 years. If the interets absoultey vests and lastly Oliver's granchild Vivian would have a contingent remainder in fee simple. Unlike her brother, Vivi's interst is a contingent remiander because she although she is an ascertained person she has not met condition expressly stated in the grrant to obtain interest. The next issue to be determined is whether or not any of these interets violate the Rule against Perpetuities, RAP. RAP is a common law appraoch where the court determines whether or not certain interets will STILL be contingent or not in a life and being +21 years. If the interets absoultey vests within a life in being + 21 years, then it is valid under the rule. If it will not vest in that time frame or if it still may be contingent after the life in being +21 years, the court will determine it to be void against RAP and cross the interest out of the grant, like it never existed. the interets that the court deem to be appliable under RAP are (1) contingent remainders (2) vested reaminders subject to open and (3) execturoy interets. The only interests applicable in the facts about are both Victor and Vivi's, the granchildren. Because the two are partt of a class, it must be detemined when the class will close in order to depict when the interest will in fact vest. Under RAP, the interest of both granchildren would be void because even though their interest may not vest after the death of either of their parents because Robert could still be alive and be in present possessory of Blackacre for over 21 years, causing their interest not to vest until 22 years or 50 years after the death of their parents. Although Victor already has satisfied the age requirement of the grant, that is irrelevant because when dealing with a class, all memebers of the class must satisfy the grant. If one does not, then all the class members do not. Some jurisditcitions follow the rule of convience where if one memeber of the class satsifies the grant, their interets vest and whomever is alive at the time of the creation of the grant may be able to satsify the condition of the grant. No afterborn children will be added into that specific class. Therefore, because the grandchildren's interest violates RAP, the grant will be re-written as ""to the first of my children, for life, then to my nephew Robert"" The interest would now be: Connor and Carla have a life estate subject to condition subsquent Robert would have a vested remainder in life estate And the Estate of Oliver would have a reversion. "," 1A) Brock, Robert would have a vested remainder in life estate And the Estate of Oliver would have a reversion. 2) 1A) Brock, First and Foremost, I would just like to say that I am sorry for your business troubles, it is never easing when dealing with situations like this but hopefully my letter will give you some options and you can decide what would be your best course of action. The first issue that must be discussed is what is your proeprty interest in the Brewery with Alex. The interest that both you are your brother hold are of tennacts in common in the proeprty. Tenancts in Common(TIC for short) is a default estate where property is held in 2 or more persons where each party has a right of possession of the whole party regardless of possible the fractional differences in their ownership. TIC's are also able to convey their interest in the property within their life or at their death. The next issue that must be address are any steps that can be taken to as you would put it ""make some money from this developer."" The best argument for you would be as a TIC with your brother to ask the court for a Partition in Sale. Parition in Sale is used when TIC (tenants in common) have differing interest in what to do with their jointely owned property. When one party brings a parition in sale, they bear the burden to prove to the court that the property owned by the parties should be put up for sale; the profits being split between the parties according to their interests. (Delfino v. Valencias) The party moving for action must prove to the court that this is the most practial thing to do considering the physical attributes of the property and it is most equitable for both parties. Courts do NOT perfer doing this because they feel as though it is more benficial to keep property in the hands of the owners and that TIC's should be able to work out their problems on their own. Therefore, I recommend trying to work things out with your brother. If you feel like this is not a possibility, we can move forward with a partition in sale petition to the court. You would have the burden of proving that this is the only equitable remedy for the two of you to successful benefit because a parition in kind is not applicable in this situation. Parition in kind is where the court orders a physical seperation of the proprety to divide the interets of the parties. Courts perfer this method, because they the property is being used, and people are keeping the property. The only fear the courts have in doing this is when they do not know what part of the property could potentinally be valued of not. For example, courts wouldn't want to split land in half and then gold is found on one partition in sale petition to the court. You would have the burden of proving that this is the only equitable remedy for the two of you to successful benefit because a parition in kind is not applicable in this situation. Parition in kind is where the court orders a physical seperation of the proprety to divide the interets of the parties. Courts perfer this method, because they the property is being used, and people are keeping the property. The only fear the courts have in doing this is when they do not know what part of the property could potentinally be valued of not. For example, courts wouldn't want to split land in half and then gold is found on one half 10 years later making the property more valuable. Nevertheless, courts will use a parition in kind if it is practical and they are physical able to do so considering the nature of the property. Because of the nature and location of the busines being in a very established area, the court may not see it being physically possibly to split apart a brewery. If we went through with a parition for sale, surely your brother Alex would try to convine the court for a partition in kind because of his emotional attachment to the proeprty. When splitting the land, courts typically take this into account. Hoping to hear from you soon, please contact me with any further questions. Best, Excellent Attorney 1B) Carl, The first issue we need to discuss is of the gold coins and whether or not you have a rightfult legal claim. In determining this, the court will look at different catergories of property. There is (1) Abandon (2) lost (3) mislaid and (4) Treasure trove. The court will depict the quailities of each one and the circumstances you found the items when making their decision. It is likley that the Gold Coins : would be considered treasure trove if this catergory of property is still followed in that particular state. Treasure trove entials found property when it consists of coins or some type of urrency. If determined to be treasure trove, the property would go (1) to the owner is discoverable and (2) then to the finder. If the court determines that the coins should in fact be considered treasure trove the next issue is whether or not there would be any competitng interests. The grocery store would have a competing ineterest because of the nature of the coins, not being that old, and being found in a bag with the logo of the local grocery store on it, it is likely the grocery store will claim that that are the true owner, therefore Treasure trove entials found property when it consists of coins or some type of urrency. If determined to be treasure trove, the property would go (1) to the owner is discoverable and (2) then to the finder. If the court determines that the coins should in fact be considered treasure trove the next issue is whether or not there would be any competitng interests. The grocery store would have a competing ineterest because of the nature of the coins, not being that old, and being found in a bag with the logo of the local grocery store on it, it is likely the grocery store will claim that that are the true owner, therefore true owenrship defeats the claim of the finder, therefore, if found to be the grocery stores your interest would be irrelvant because the grocery story would have a superior title. But I find that unlikely considering how mush the golden coins have been appraised for, it is a more liekly situation that the coins were another owners and they were merely left in a grocery store back. In light of the court likely determining that the court would not find the coins to be the grocery stores and If the state DOES NOT follow the treasure trove statute, (like in Corlis v. Wennerx) the next issue would be could the property be considered considered lost or mislaid. In determining the court would have to look at the circumstances pertaining to the findings of the item. A item is considered lost is the proeprty that has been unintentionally and involuntarily place somewhere where the owner of the property has/forget it was there. If lost the property would go to (1) the true owner and then the finder. In contrast, mislaid property is when the propery is either voluntary or intentionally placed somewhere and the owner has simply over looked where the placed the item. If found to be mislaid, the property would go (1) to the true owner and then to (2) the owner of the establishment, (Macoy v. Medina) because if the property was only placed there voluntarily, it is likely that is the first place the owner will go back to look for it and it is held in society that ""we"" want the true owner to be able to find their property. (Corlis v. Wennerx) If the court finds that because the coins where in good condition and they were in a small convient hiding spot in the bar like in Benjamin v. Linder Avaition the court would rule that because of the nature of the hiding spot, The bar would have a competing interest and they would argue that the property was mislaid, therefore they should be entitled to it. This would also follow a modern trend of social policy that where owner is found on someones property the owner should have possession over it.When something is found on property, it is reasonably assumed that the owner of the property would get it.This is to discourage trepass and to avoid speculation over who the true owner is. The next issue given the facts would be any interests you have to the Growler. The court is likely to determine that a Bailment was created. A bailment is when the owner (Bailor) entrusts the possessor(Bailee) with property. The Bailee owes a duty of reasonable of care to the Bailor and the itme in their possession the court will look at the cirumstances regarding the property and the amount of have possession over it.When something is found on property, it is reasonably assumed that the owner of the property would get it.This is to discourage trepass and to avoid speculation over who the true owner is. The next issue given the facts would be any interests you have to the Growler. The court is likely to determine that a Bailment was created. A bailment is when the owner (Bailor) entrusts the possessor(Bailee) with property. The Bailee owes a duty of reasonable of care to the Bailor and the itme in their possession the court will look at the cirumstances regarding the property and the amount of control the Baile had, and whether it was reasonably could be implied that a bailment was created.(Allen v. Hyatt) because the item has a ticket on it and the store also kep a ticket it can be reasonably assumed that they were in full control over it because you,Carl had not possession over it. You would have a legal claim to collect against the Bailee because they owed a reasonable duty of care to your proeprty that you have entrusted them with.The Bartender would argue that the ticket was only meant to certify a purchase and therefore a bailment was not created, because they did not expreslly create one. But we would argue that Bailments can be implied through the nature and the circumstances of the transfer of property. The next issue in the fact pattern is whether or not you have abandoned your coat. Abandon proeprty, is when the owner relinquishes all claims. The court will likely take into account that fact that when you realized that your coat was nowhere to be found and you said ""forget it"" and then walked out of the business. The court is likely to see that you abandoned your rights to your coat thererfore whoever find its is entitled to it against all other person, including you, the prior owner. The best counterarguement would be to argue that you did not you did not expressly relinquished all your rights. Because you could not find the coat, it is merely lost property and even though you left the prmise did not mean you would give up searching for it. My legal recommendation would be to go back to the bar and inquire abou the coat because if you do the court is more likely to see the proeprty as lost, but if you do not, the court is more liekly to consdiered it to be abandoned and your itnerests in the property of it will diminish. 1C) in the party's. David has a fee simple subject to The first isse to be detemineable are what are the 7interest condition subsquent and Frank and Fred have executory interest in fee simple. David's interest in the property are contingent upon that (1) a stated condition must be satisfied and if it is not satisfied the 1C) The first isse to be detemineable are what are the interest in the party's. David has a fee simple subject to condition subsquent and Frank and Fred have executory interest in fee simple. David's interest in the property are contingent upon that (1) a stated condition must be satisfied and if it is not satisfied the interest he currently has can be taken bac by the grantor by a right of entry. The next issue that mist be addresssed in this first grant is whether or not any of these interest violate the Rule Against Perpetutities. RAP is a common law appraoch where the court determines whether or not certain interets will STILL be contingent or not in a life and being +21 years. If the interets absoultey vests within a life in being + 21 years, then it is valid under the rule. If it will not vest in that time frame or if it still may be contingent after the life in being +21 years, the court will determine it to be void against RAP and cross the interest out of the grant, like it never existed. the interets that the court deem to be appliable under RAP are (1) contingent remainders (2) vested reaminders subject to open and (3) execturoy interets. In this case Frank and Fred's interest are subject to RAP. Unfortunatly their interest violates RAP because there is a senerio where the property would could not be used as a residental property for 100 years and then Fred and Franks interest could vest. Because of this, the sons interest are void and the grant will be rewritten as such ""to David, so long as the property is use for residental uses only.""Then, if it is ever used for non-residental uses Alex would have a Right of Entry where once the proeprty is not being used as a residential property, Adam could take affrimative steps to re enter the proeprty and take bakc the property. Therefore, It is in Alex's best interest to take action against david because he is using the proeprty violating the condition left to him by the grant from Alex The next issue to be determined would wether or not Edward has a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to conditions subsquent. A fee simple determinable is governed by words of duration where the grantor has a possibility of reverter. With a possibility of reverter, as soon as the property is not being used under the condition state, unlike an Right of Entry where affrimative steps must be taken, the interest immediately springs up to the grantor and it automatically becomes their property once more. If the court finds that edward has a fee simple subject to condition subsquent where a specific condition must be satsified in order for the property interest to be kept. If the condition is broken, the grantor Alex, would have a right of entry where affirmative steps would have to be taken in order to aquire the property.Based on the languge in the grant, the courts would probably detemrine this to be ambigus language because duation language is being used in the terms ""so long as"" but there is a clause the interest immediately springs up to the grantor and it automatically becomes their property once more. If the court finds that edward has a fee simple subject to condition subsquent where a specific condition must be satsified in order for the property interest to be kept. If the condition is broken, the grantor Alex, would have a right of entry where affirmative steps would have to be taken in order to aquire the property.Based on the languge in the grant, the courts would probably detemrine this to be ambigus language because duation language is being used in the terms ""so long as"" but there is a clause at the end of the grant that givesn Alex permission to ""have a right to re-enter and reclaim the premise."" This is similar to the Marenholz case where the lanaguge of the interest was ambiguous and the courts again had to make a determination. At the time, Marenholz case held the lanaguege specific to that casue to be a fee simple determinable. But in light of modern trends, court have seemed lenient to grant such an interest because they want to give the proerty owner every possibility of retianing the proeprty for long. SO courts have favored granting a fee simple subject to condition subsquent instead so grantors have to take affrimative steps to the property rather than being abe to immediately reclaim the proeprty. So, if the court grants a fee simple determinable in this case, then Alex may enter Edwards land by possibility of reverter and immeditaly legal kick him off the land by violating the use of the land that was granted to him. If the court decides the late, to aware a fee simple subject to condition subsquent, Alex would not be able to immediatly kick Edward off the property with a right of entry, he would have to take affrimative steps to do so, making the porcess longer. 3) "," Arguments for Debbie The first issue that must be anaylzed is whether of not Debbie has satisified a claim for Adverse possession. Adverse Possession is claiming land another's as the adverse possessers' own, against the rightful owner. Adverse Possession can be satsified through the following elements. The possession of the land must be (1) Continous (2) Hostile (3) Open and Notorious (4) Actual (5) Exclusive and within an allocated period of time, deterrmined seperatly9depending on each jurisdcition, in this case that is 10 years. Adverse Possession is allowable and a claim in an effort to try and prevent owners from sleeping on their rights by reasonably tkaing acocunt of their property and for rewarding other who put unused The first issue that must be anaylzed is whether of not Debbie has satisified a claim for Adverse possession. Adverse Possession is claiming land another's as the adverse possessers' own, against the rightful owner. Adverse Possession can be satsified through the following elements. The possession of the land must be (1) Continous (2) Hostile (3) Open and Notorious (4) Actual (5) Exclusive and within an allocated period of time, deterrmined seperatly depending on each jurisdcition, in this case that is 10 years. Adverse Possession is allowable and a claim in an effort to try and prevent owners from sleeping on their rights by reasonably tkaing acocunt of their property and for rewarding other who put unused land to benificial use. Locke embodies this in his theory that all labor that goes into proeprty should be rewarded. Debbie will bring a claim of adverse possession that began to toll when her father Chris was conveyed the land. Although he was conveyed the land under a color of title, a title that is defective or invalid because it has not been prouce in good faith or it is vlaid for some other reason. In this case it would be that Betty's signative, one of the tenants of Entirety never signed away the property. Her signature was forged. Debbie will say that her adverse possession was done in faith, since her father had always been using the land for 8 years, she never suspected that the title to the land was invalid. The court is likey to find that although there a solor of title, Debbie was under constructive possession because she reasonably beleived the title of the land was hers. Debbie also must argue that she has satisfied all of the conditions of an adverse posession. Her possession was contuinous being that she moved in at 2011, and lived there year round. Her actions were also hostile because she did not know that it was another's land (Tiue v. Morgan), therefore to a min. she was at least not given possession from the true owner, in fact, because of her constructive possession, she always had a reasonable good faith belief that the proeprty was hers becasue it was conveyed to her by her father. The court will always award good faith actions rather than bath faith(Tiue v. Morgan). Next she was acting open and notorious being that she was in the open, The ""real property"" owners could have seen her on the land if they took reasonable account of their land or could have reasonable reasonable notice that she was there considering that hunters where given permission to be on the land by her, therefore, Betty should have had reasonable knowledge that she was reasonably using the land open and notoriously. The next element is actual possession, because Debbie was living on it the possession was atcual becuase she was physically on the property and was giving her permission to others to be on the propery and have access to it.(Tiue v. Morgan/ Pimental v. Lepore) lastly her ownership was exlcusive because agian she was living on the property and although there were hunters coming on and off the property, they had her permission, making her ownership 10 is exlcusive to others. The last element to be satsified that she satisfied the time limit of 10 years. Since her father proviously owned the property then in 2001, that was when the adverse possession became, and in 2009 when he died, when she was conveyed the property, she tacked on to her fathers adverse on it the possession was atcual becuase she was physically on the property and was giving her permission to others to be on the propery and have access to it.(Tiue v. Morgan/ Pimental v. Lepore) lastly her ownership was exlcusive because agian she was living on the property and although there were hunters coming on and off the property, they had her permission, making her ownership exlcusive to others. The last element to be satsified is that she satisfied the time limit of 10 years. Since her father proviously owned the property then in 2001, that was when the adverse possession became, and in 2009 when he died, when she was conveyed the property, she tacked on to her fathers adverse possessing. Tacking invovles when there is one party that adversly possesses the property and then another finishes off the remaining years needed to be satsified. Tacking can only be satsified if there is privit, menaing a voluntary (Groski v. Manillo) and becuase there was a voluntary conveyance of property the court is likely to conclude that tacking did apply and that Debbie satsified the elements of adverse posession, therefore she is the rightful owner of the property. The next issue that must be focused on are what is Betty's strongest argument against Debbie's adverse possession ascertain. The strongest legal claim Debbie will have is to argue that the conveyance to Debbie's father Chris was not valid because of her tenancy of the entirey by her husband did not give him the ability to convey the land. Therefore the transfer of land in 2001 giving Chris title to Greenacre was invalid. A tenancy by the entitery is similar to joint tenancy where 2 or more persons are onve property interest in a piece of land that must have been made with language to create a tenancy by the entirety and to have satsified PITT and there must be a valid unifed marriage between the twon parties. PITT stands for (1) Possession, where each tennact must have posession over the whole property and may not exclude each other (2) Interest, must be of the same interest and of equal dividents (3) Title, each tenact must have aquired title to the property (4) Time, each tenat must have acquired their interest at the same time, in the same legal instrument. In a tenancy by the entirety, the husband and wife act and own the property in the eyes of the law ""as one person."" They made NOT make decisions unilaterally, they cannot exlcude each other from the property or individually sever the tenancy. Tenats in the entirety also may not unilaterally convey their interest to the other. When one tenant dies the other has a right of surviorship, where they take the dying party's interest and it becomes there own. For example, if there is a husband and Wife who each own 50% of Blackacre, if the wife dies first, the husband will now have 100% property interest in Blackacre. The onyl way to sever a tenancy by the entirety is for the couple to come to a joint argeement between the two of them, divorce or one parties dies. Because Betty and Andre have ownership over their land in Greenacre in this cirumstance, Andrew was not at liberty to unilaterally convey interest in the property without his wife's permission. Therefore, Because Betty did also may not unilaterally convey their interest to the other. When one tenant dies the other has a right of surviorship, where they take the dying party's interest and it becomes there own. For example, if there is a husband and Wife who each own 50% of Blackacre, if the wife dies first, the husband will now have 100% property interest in Blackacre. The onyl way to sever a tenancy by the entirety is for the couple to come to a joint argeement between the two of them, divorce or one parties dies. Because Betty and Andre have ownership over their land in Greenacre in this cirumstance, Andrew was not at liberty to unilaterally convey interest in the property without his wife's permission. Therefore, Because Betty did not actaully sign the conveyence of land, the court is likely to find that the transfer was invalid and Chris never attained property interest in Greenacre. The next issue would be that if the conveyance of property to Chris was still valid does Debbie still have an adverse posession claim? Betty is likely to argue that if the conveyance of property did not take place, then Debbie did not start adversley posessing until she bagin living there in 2011. Since it is 2019, that is only 9 years, therefore the adverse posession saturoty limitation has not been satsified and the court is likely to find that Debbie did not satsifie the elements of an adverse posesser therefore does not have a claim in the property. ",846,2874,1523
7a4dfc2e-553b-4bc6-bc18-3b0626c17a1e," Oliver (O) is the grator, O's children and grandchildren are the grantees. O conveyed his property to 'the first of my children to retire"". This is a contigent remainder life estate. It is contingent because there is a condiction precedent that the child must retire. After the death of the first child to retire, Robert now has a vested remainder in life estate because he is an acertained person, and all he has to do it wait until the first child to retire dies. Next the estate would go to any grandchild that reaches the age of 25. Oliver has one grandchild, Victor who is 26 and has already satisfied the age requirment. Victor has a vested remainder in fee simple subject to open. This is an open class because more grandchildren could be born and dilute the inheritance. Vivian, not yet 25, has a contingent remainder in fee simple subject to open. Vivian still has to satisfy the condition before being able to be a part of the conveyance. Because the grandchildren have a fee simple, this now destroys O's reversion. The rule against perpatuities (RAP) limits deadhand control of property. It states that future interest must vest, or not, withing 21 years and 10 months of a controling persons death. In this present case, It is possible for one of O's grandchildren to reach the age of 25 more then 21 years after O and his children die. Therefore, this future interest violates RAP and should be removed from this conveyance. It should be rewritten as follows: ""to the first of my children to retire, for life, then to my nephew Robert, for life"". We need to remove the section that violates RAP. O now has a reversion after Robert dies. "," A. Brocks Property Inerest. The issue is whether or not Brock can sell his share of the property to the developer without consent from Alex. Brock and his Brother are Tennants in Common, this means that he and his brother both share an interest, in this case each would own 50% of the business and land as he pruchased this half Part III A. Brocks Property Inerest. The issue is whether or not Brock can sell his share of the property to the developer without consent from Alex. Brock and his Brother are Tennants in Common, this means that he and his brother both share an interest, in this case each would own 50% of the business and land as he pruchased this half from Alex at the time the Tennacy in Common was created. Tennancy in Common is different from that of Joint Tennancy and Tennants by the entirety in that there is no right of survivorship. If Brock is looking to sell his share of the property (and business), without that of Alex's concent, he will need to sever theTennancy in Common. This situation is unlike the Harms and US v. Craft cases in that Alex does not automatically take over Brocks half of the estate once Brock severs the tennancy in common. In the present case, it would be impracticle for the developer to only buy one half of this property, as all of it is needed for the condoes. If Brock cannont get Alex to agree to selling both of thier shares, there are two options that remain. Similar to the case of Delfino v. Vealencis, the court in the present case will have to decide if a partition in kind or a partition in sale is best for both parties. In a partition in kind, the land is physically devided to reflect the ownership interests in both parties. In a partition in sale, both parties are force to sell thier shares of the whole property. A partition in kind is usually prefered by the courts as the idea of forcing someone to sell thier land is severe. If a court cannot partition the land in kind becasuse of its physical characteristics, then a partition in sale is completed. In the present case, a partition in kind is improbable, as the developer will likley require that the brewery be torn down, resulting in the closing of the business alltogher. Although alex may argue that he could move the brewery on his side of the land, this may still cuase problems for the developer, as there may be issues with the roadways and that people buying the condoes do not want to live next to a brewery. A court will likley order the land to be partitioned in sale, and that each brother will be paid out equally for thier share in the business. B. Letter to Carl Dear Mr. Cask, Thank you for reaching out to my office, I will discuss your rights to the gold coins, coat and growler. The first issue is wether you can keep the gold coins. Property can be lost, mislaid, abandoned, embedded, and in some cases were considered to3be of a8 treasure trove. Because you had to reach into the wall of the warehouse to get the coins, a court may see this as embedded property. Embedded property is any items that are found to be a part of somonelses land. A good example of this is Dear Mr. Cask, Thank you for reaching out to my office, I will discuss your rights to the gold coins, coat and growler. The first issue is wether you can keep the gold coins. Property can be lost, mislaid, abandoned, embedded, and in some cases were considered to be a treasure trove. Because you had to reach into the wall of the warehouse to get the coins, a court may see this as embedded property. Embedded property is any items that are found to be a part of somonelses land. A good example of this is dinosour bones found in somones back yard that have grown into the surronding rock and soil. This property will always be given to the owner of the property on which it was found. Although the coins are not grown into the warehouse, the Corliss v. Wenner case shows us that property discovered to be attached or in ones property can be considered emedded property. In the present case, the coins were found inside a wall of the warehouse and therefore would be the property of the owners of the brewery. This would likley not be considered as a treasure trove, as the Corliss court rejected that idea becacuse it promotes tresspass and because it was not recognized by the common laws of England. Treasure trove would go to the finder, in the present case this would not be applicable. Additionally, if we were to argue that you should have the coins because obviously someone left (lost) them in the warehouse, the McAvoy court agues that the owner of the establishment in which you found the lost item in is who gets the item. Presently, again the coins would go back to the brewery. Also, under the Lindner court, if the item is deemed to be mislaid, the owner of the property where it was found get to keep what is found. Here again, the brewery would get the coins back. While you may want to argue that someone abandoned the the coins and therefore you should be able to keep them, and in the Armory case, we see that the finder can be the keeper, in the present case, the evidence suggest that the coins would go to the brewery. The second issue is that of the growler and jacket. The growler can be considered a bailment. A bailment is when the bailor (Carl) gives his possesion to the bailee (brewery) for a limited amount of time for a particular circumstance and expects to get his belonging back after the transaction is complete. In a sense, the bailee is entrusted to keep the property safe as the bailee is only a partial and temporary owner of that item. In the present case, Carl gave the growler to the bar to refill. You were given a ticket and reasonably expected to have your property returned to you at the end of the transaction. In Allen v. Hyatt, we see that if somone places thier property in the care of another, there is a reasonable expectation that that property will be kept safe. In the present case, Carl was given a ticket for his growler showing that it was a formal handoff to the bailee. While the dissent in Allen v. Hyatt may not be conviced that the present case would amount to a bailment in which the brewery is liable, complete. In a sense, the bailee is entrusted to keep the property safe as the bailee is only a partial and temporary owner of that item. In the present case, Carl gave the growler to the bar to refill. You were given a ticket and reasonably expected to have your property returned to you at the end of the transaction. In Allen v. Hyatt, we see that if somone places thier property in the care of another, there is a reasonable expectation that that property will be kept safe. In the present case, Carl was given a ticket for his growler showing that it was a formal handoff to the bailee. While the dissent in Allen v. Hyatt may not be conviced that the present case would amount to a bailment in which the brewery is liable, under the majority ruling, a court will likley find that thebar violated the bailment by giving away or breaking carls growler. The issues of the missing coat is not the same as the growler. This may not be a bailment because Car placed his coat on a public coat rack. There is nothing to demonstrate that the brewery had particular knowledge that is was careing for carls coat. There was no coat check or anything else to suggest that the brewery was in control and possession of Carls coat. Here under Allen. v. Hyatt, a court would likley rule that the brewery is not liable for the coat in the same way that it is for the growler. Thank you. C. Future Interests The issue is what interests to each party have in the devided property. First we need to examin David. Alex conveys to David a fee simple absolute subject to executory limitation. Here, David has a fee simple so long as he does not violate Alex's wishes by using the property for something other than residences, BUT if he does violate this, then this interest is cut short and is given to Frank and Fred who have a fee simple in a shifting executory interst. Now that David is going to use the property for non-residential use, the property is conveyed to Frank and Fred. David will lose his interest in the property. In Edward's case, Alex conveyed Edward a fee simple absolute subject to condition subsequent. Here, Edward has a fee simple but this interest can be taken away and be conveyed back to Alex if Edward starts to make IPAs. Here, Alex would hava right of entry in which Alex could excerise his right to take back the property. Now that Edward is making IPAs and is violating Alex's wishes, Alex will have to decide if he wants to take back the property as his right of entry is not automatic as a matter of law. "," The issue is the issue of whether Andrew could sell off thier property without Betty's permission/knowledge. First, Andrew's forgery of Betty's signature is illegal and from the start we can say that the origional sale is illegal. Next, can Andrew have sold off some of their property held in Tennants by the Entirety withought Betty anyways? A Tennancy by the entirty is a special type of tennancy that is only allowed for married couples. Here each spouse owns the entire property. It is not devided into shares like a tennancy in common and does have survivorship like that of joint tennants. Tennancy by the entirety cannot sever this tennancy unilaterally. They must have permission from the other or sever it through divorce. In US. v. Craft, the supreme court held that one spouce cannot transfer title of the property to another because the property is owned concurrently by both spouces. In the present case, Andrew would not have been able to sell the land on his own, as Betty would have had to agree to it. He cannot make those kids of decisions unilaterally. The next issue is that of the adverse possession of Greenacre. In oder for an adverse possession to be valid it must meet five criteria: 1. Actual, 2. Open/Notorios, 3. Exclusive, 4. Continuous, and 5. Hostile. There must also be a passage of 10 years to vest this interst. I will explain each of these in depth. Actual: The possessors use of the land must be in a way that a typical owner would use it. In the present case, both Chris and his daughter use the land to live on and hunt and enjoy for all the same reasons that Andrew and Betty used it for. Their use of this land meets the criteria for an actual use of the land. Open/Notorios: The possesors must use the land so that it is clear that they are using it and that anyone from the outside and tell that they are in use of the land. In the present case, Chris and then his daughter do not hide the fact that they use this land. By making improvements to the house and expanding it, coupled with the fact that they broughght visitors to the house, they were open with their use of the land and would satisfy this element. Exclusive: The possessors must have total control over their land. In the present case, Chris and then Debbie gives permission to the neighbors to use the property. This shows that she is the one excersising Open/Notorios: The possesors must use the land so that it is clear that they are using it and that anyone from the outside and tell that they are in use of the land. In the present case, Chris and then his daughter do not hide the fact that they use this land. By making improvements to the house and expanding it, coupled with the fact that they broughght visitors to the house, they were open with their use of the land and would satisfy this element. Exclusive: The possessors must have total control over their land. In the present case, Chris and then Debbie gives permission to the neighbors to use the property. This shows that she is the one excersising the right to exlude and therefore feels that she has the exclusive right to live there. Continuous: A possesor must live on the property in a relativley continuous fashion. In the present case, Chris visited the cabin in the fishing season which is the traditional timeframe to use the cabin. Him not being there other times of the year does not void his continous control. Additionally, Debbie does not void her continuous control by allowing visitors to use the land. Hostile: A possessor must belive that they are posessing thier own land, or no that somone else has a supperior title. In Dombrowski, we see that Maine requires that the possessor know that they are trying to adversly possess the land. In the present case, neither Debbie nor chris know that they are not on thier land. Now that all all five elements are outlines we can analyze the present case. The ten year SOL has been satisfied bececause under Tieu, we know that tacting occured when Chris left the estate to Debbie. The SOL clock started in 2001 and did not stop once Debbie took over. Here ten years has past, and this element of adverse possession has been satified. The act of living on this land and expanding the cabin is a much larger feat than in Manillo, and therfore is open and notorios in addition to the reasons described above. In Marango, the Ross' could not immediatly tell that their property had been infinged upon, in the present case, there is complete open and notorious use of the land. Betty may be able to rebutt some of these elements due to the fact that she was unaware that Debbie was on her property, therefore voiding open and notorious. Additionally, Debbie did not know that she was one somonelses land, this could void the Hostiliy rule, apart from the Dombowski rule, a mistake of property could be accepted, but may not be enough in this case. Overall, a court will likley find that this was not adverse possession, as the sale was fraud, and not all five elements of adverse possession were satisfied. property could be accepted, but may not be enough in this case. Overall, a court will likley find that this was not adverse possession, as the sale was fraud, and not all five elements of adverse possession were satisfied. ",293,1609,942
ed56f2bc-52d8-4323-8f41-2cb80548a1dc," Oliver Has a fee simple absolute that will leave as soon as one of his children retire. His children have a contingent remainder in a life estate and as soon as one of them retires they would then have a life estate and the one who did not retire first would have nothing. Robert has a vested remainder in a life estate and would have a life estate after the child who retired first died. The grand Children have a contingent remainder in fee simple. The Rule against perpetuities (""RAP"") only applies to the childrens intrest as well as the grandchildrens intrest in the poroperty due to the fact that they have contingent remainders and those are intrests that are subject to RAP. The intrest in the children is fine due to the fact that they are both alive at the time of the grant. The issue is that of the grandchildren due to the fact that there intrest could vest after 21 year of a life in being at the time of the grant. Despite the fct that the is 2 grandchildren alive at the time they could die. Then if the children have another child but die when the baby is 1 the intrest would not vest in 21 years. This iis due to the fact that the children are the measuring life due to the fact that they control the class that can take the intrest. To fix this you would rewrite it as such: ""to the first of my children to retire, for life, then to my nephew robert for life."" "," A. Dear Brock, With regards to you intrest in you property I have come up with some key points that could better advise you with what you might want to look to do in order to try and make money out of your property. You and your brother both own what is know as a tennacy in common. What this means is that you both own a fractunal yet undivided intrest in the property. This is different from a joint tennacy that would have a right of survivorship. The clear language in the deed clearly identifies that you have a Tennancy in common. Now with regards to what to do with your property. First I would try once more to talk with you brother to see if he is intrested in selling the property, but it seems that this has been unsuccesful. So in your case we might look to petition the court to partition the propert. There are two kinds of partitions that the court will consider, physical partition ( partition in kind) this is when the that you both own a fractunal yet undivided intrest in the property. This is different from a joint tennacy that would have a right of survivorship. The clear language in the deed clearly identifies that you have a Tennancy in common. Now with regards to what to do with your property. First I would try once more to talk with you brother to see if he is intrested in selling the property, but it seems that this has been unsuccesful. So in your case we might look to petition the court to partition the propert. There are two kinds of partitions that the court will consider, physical partition ( partition in kind) this is when the court will divide the property up between you two and you will become free to do with that property as you will and the other is a partition by sale this is when the court will sell the property and you will recieve payment for you 50% of the property. The doctrine states that the courts will favor the partition in kind due to the fact that they do not think it would be fair to force another into selling their land. This being said often a court will often use a partition in sale due to the fact that it can be rather difficult for them to correctly value the land and to make sure that when they split that land it is done in a fair and just way. In your case the court will likely though go for a partition in kind due to your brothers emotional connection with the property. If the courts due do so they will likely grant him the warehouse due to the emount of effort and fanacial gain that he has put into the property. The court will likely look at the heavy investment put forward of 500,000 dollars as a substantial investment in the property and they will want to protect this intrest as well as they will strongly take into account the emotional connection that he has with the bussiness. Also the fact that selling the property would be a substantial blow to the cities intrest due to the fact that they employ people in the tasting room as well as the rasurant and that business would be missed if the land was sold. As well as the beer they sell to different bars would be missed. The court might think it would be unfair to wrongfully force your brother to sell the property when they see that it has been his dream for so long. Such actions might detur others from investing in there property or land or starting a company due to the fact that at any time the courts can take it away and force a sail. For you to come and reap what you have not worked for would be a searious wrong doing. Now if you were to argue to the court that they should exercise their ability to do a partition in sale you must carry the burdern of proof and prove that spliting the land up would not be practical and you must show that both parties would be better off with a sale. You would need to show that splitting a single factory in half would indeed not be practical for both parties. Doing so would just lead to greater issues due to the fact that trying to run a business when you can only use half of the building would not be practical. Your brother might see it this way or could argue that he would simply split the buliding giving you the tasting room and he would be given the restaurant or the other way around but more likely than Now if you were to argue to the court that they should exercise their ability to do a partition in sale you must carry the burdern of proof and prove that spliting the land up would not be practical and you must show that both parties would be better off with a sale. You would need to show that splitting a single factory in half would indeed not be practical for both parties. Doing so would just lead to greater issues due to the fact that trying to run a business when you can only use half of the building would not be practical. Your brother might see it this way or could argue that he would simply split the buliding giving you the tasting room and he would be given the restaurant or the other way around but more likely than not the court will see splitting the warehouse as not being practicul. You must also show that you to would be better of with a sale. Your brother put down 500,000 for the property and after you payed him for your half that could have been cut in half. The sale of the property would leave the two of you better off due to the fact that you would bothe be given 1,000,000 and your brother would be able to move his business else where while still keeping some of the money. This payment from the the real estate developer would be granting them more monety that the property is even worth thus clearly leaving them in a better position finacialy. This all being said your brother has a emotional connection to the building and might claim that after all he has put into his property to have it taken from him would not leave him better off. The courts will likely see the sentimental value your brother has in the property and prefer for the court to do a partition in kind thus splitting the property. From a policy perspective they will see it unfair to take away someones property after all the had work and heavy investment that they had put in to the land. As well as the fact that property should serve human values and to take away the brewery would force people to lose jobs as well as the city would lose a vibrant business. This being said your brother has seemingly ousted you from the property. Despite that fact that you are both tennance in common meaning you are not meant to have to pay rent. The rule states that if there has been an agreement for rent or one of the co tenants has been ousted you may request rent. due to the fact that you brother told you to never return you might be able to get rent payment from him. This being said this would probably destroy you friendship even more. B. Dear Carl, Congrats on finding the coins but there might be a few legal issues that we would need to go over. We will need to decide if the gold coins that you found were lost or mislade as well as if we can claim treasure trove. Finders law states that the finder of property has a right good against the world but not 9 is lost property or simply mislaid. IF its lost against the legal owner. We need to first disscuss 4ifofthis you will be able to lay claim to it until the local grocery store comes and asks for it back. If it was mislade you will have to give it back to the brewery due to the fact that the owner would expect it to be B. Dear Carl, Congrats on finding the coins but there might be a few legal issues that we would need to go over. We will need to decide if the gold coins that you found were lost or mislade as well as if we can claim treasure trove. Finders law states that the finder of property has a right good against the world but not against the legal owner. We need to first disscuss if this is lost property or simply mislaid. IF its lost you will be able to lay claim to it until the local grocery store comes and asks for it back. If it was mislade you will have to give it back to the brewery due to the fact that the owner would expect it to be where he last place it and might come back for it. or possibly if the coins were abandoned meaning you would be able to claim them. The fact surrounding the coins though can make it a tricky distinction. In order for you to claim it as abandoned you must prove that the owner has throwen them out. This would be a tricky point to argue. you might want to claim that they have left the goods underground for an extended period of time so this would go to show that they no longer had use for them. The shop though would argue that they took time in putting their name on the coins to make sure that people knew who owned the good as well as the fact that they took care to palce it under ground. For it to be lost we might also have a hard time to win this claim and even if you do prove it was mislaid you would have to grant the coins to the property owner so that the store could find it when they came looking. the fact that they left a bit of it visible to indicate to them where they had put it down is a clain indicatore that they simply placed it there and the forgot to pick it up. You might argue that the coins were left in the ground of a ware house and werent place nicely on a shelf indicating that they had lost the good and not misplaced. The store will agrue back that they had purposly left it there for safe keeping. I believe that these coins have simply been mislade. The courts will consider that a tiny bit was visible and that they carefully put there name on it so that they could come back and get it later on. due to this the store might have the best legal claim to the coins. This being said there is one more type of law only followed by a few jusisdiuvtions known as treasure trove this would mean that if you find treasure such as valuable coins you can claim them. other jurisdictions want to protect property owners from diging around in their yard so the follow imbeded property this would leave the property owner in control of all treasure found on the proerty. I believe the propery owner will have the best claim to these coins only beat by the store. Now with regards to you growler and coat. We are dealing with an issue regarding bailments. A bailment is a voluntairy delivery of your possession without delivering title. this can be done by contract of through implied bailment as seen in the hyatt case that i have attached. The Bailee (the brewery) has a The Bailee may also contract around this but is responsibility to act with care under the circumstances. limited by common law contracts and the statute. With regard to you growler it seems like you have entered into an implied bailment with the bar. When they gifted you the ticket there was an implied beat by the store. Now with regards to you growler and coat. We are dealing with an issue regarding bailments. A bailment is a voluntairy delivery of your possession without delivering title. this can be done by contract of through implied bailment as seen in the hyatt case that i have attached. The Bailee (the brewery) has a responsibility to act with care under the circumstances. The Bailee may also contract around this but is limited by common law contracts and the statute. With regard to you growler it seems like you have entered into an implied bailment with the bar. When they gifted you the ticket there was an implied meaning that they will return your growler to you and only you when you grant the ticket back to them. The bar might try and argue that no bailment has been formed due to the lack of written consent but the fact that they gave a ticket and the bar tenders watched over the growler while they served drings would say other wise. Also the court lacked the care theat should have been shown when they dropped the growler. The bar will say under the circumstances the new bartender was learning so under the circumstances in that moment they were not acting out of a lack of care. he might argue back that the growler of that value should have been handled with utmost care and that they failed. you will probably be able to recover the money. For your coat i believe you have not entered into any bailment and will not be able to recover. You voluntared to put you coat on the hook and did not have to. nobody was watching over them or handing you tickets like a coat check. Under the circumstances the acts of the bar are fine and you wont likely be able to recover unless you can show that they had camras watching the coats or if a man at the door asked to take you coat. C. Alex you have granted clearly in your language created a fee simple in david this is due to the fact that you stayed away from any terms such as ""far life that would have indicated a life estate. It is is a fee simple subject to executory limitation due to the fact that there intrest could be cut short and your sons who own a executory intrest in fee simple. and when they take the property they would have a fee simple absolute. The issue though is that of the RAP. a rule that stops an intrest that could vest after 21 years in a life and being at the time of the grant. This is done to limit dead hand control over the property and the intrest holders ability to alianate the property. Executory intreststs and executorty limitaions are subject to this rule. Your grant to your sons is void due to the fact it could vest after 21 year of a life and being at the time of the garnt. Dave could keep using the land for 200 years as a residential building and then stop this would be long after 21 years of anyone at the time of the garnt. this means your son ecexutory intrest is void and david could do as he would like. Edward and his heirs have a fee simple subjext to executory limitation due to the fact there intrest could be cut short and go to the third party, The will is ambiguis due to the fact that will has an executory intrest yet you state they have a right of reentry. this is something that only goes with a intrest that is a year of a life and being at the time of the garnt. Dave could keep using the land for 200 years as a residential building and then stop this would be long after 21 years of anyone at the time of the garnt. this means your son ecexutory intrest is void and david could do as he would like. Edward and his heirs have a fee simple subjext to executory limitation due to the fact there intrest could be cut short and go to the third party, The will is ambiguis due to the fact that will has an executory intrest yet you state they have a right of reentry. this is something that only goes with a intrest that is a subject to condiition subsequent. This being said that interst is still void under RAP due to the fact that it could vest long after 21 year in a life and being at the time of the grant Meaning you cant do anything. Its seems like bothof these claims are subject to RAP meaning both executory intrests are void 2) "," the issue is who owns greeacre. This is a classic problem about adverse possesion. Adverse possesion is when someone may take the propery the occupy even if its not theirs if they have occupied for more than 10 years under the statutory period and if they have met the five common law requrments of actual, continuis, exclusive, hostile and open and notorius. in order for something to be actual one must enter the property and use as a normal owner would. continuis is that they must have control ove the property for the stautory period uniterrupted. Exclusive is the fact the original owner has been ousted,. Hostile is did they have permision. this is a subjective test in most states and they will not look into your intentions. While other will look for bad faith and some will need good faith. Open and notorius will show that they have visibly put the owner on actual or constructive notice. The other issue is that the two married were contenants in an entirity meaning that andrew could not unilaterally sever the property and would have to do so with permission. to meet continuis you must keep control over the property for the stautory period to run. This has clearly happened due to the fact that they ahve run the statutory period and been in contiuis use. Betty might say that it was not continuis due to the fact that chris had it for 8 years and debby for 8. but through a law called tacking this allows owners who are in privity to tack your years. Privity is a leagl connection between the partis such as you had it passed on to you or sold. aslo she might argue that the fact that chris only used it for 8 weeks meant that it was not continuis. this though would be seen as regular use for an owner who owned a fishing cabin and even later on debbie moved there full time. for exclusive 9 is if the actual owner has been ousted and the this have been in use. Betty might try and argue that the use was not exclusive due to the fact that other neighbors could use it for fishing. This though would fail due to the fact that they were allwoed to be on for 8 years and debby for 8. but through a law called tacking this allows owners who are in privity to tack your years. Privity is a leagl connection between the partis such as you had it passed on to you or sold. aslo she might argue that the fact that chris only used it for 8 weeks meant that it was not continuis. this though would be seen as regular use for an owner who owned a fishing cabin and even later on debbie moved there full time. for exclusive this is if the actual owner has been ousted and the have been in use. Betty might try and argue that the use was not exclusive due to the fact that other neighbors could use it for fishing. This though would fail due to the fact that they were allwoed to be on the property meaning they had continued control over who could be on the property. Actual is if they had been using the property as an actual owner. Betty might say that using it only for fishing is not what a real owner would do to satisfy this element. But due to the fact that that chris improved upon the cabin by isulating it and enlarging it that they now have used as an owner would and this work should be protected. later on debbie built a full house where she now stayed this is cleace and actual use. Hostile is if they have permission or not. This is the most tricky. Chris entered under what is known as a color of title. This means he has a claim to the whole of greenacre if nobody else was using it despite that fact that the sale was faulty. Chris had no reason to not know the deed was was faulty so even if they try and say he was not a good faith purchasor they would likely fail. He might have had cause for concern when he bought the they property for cash. This is not that usual way of buying land in real estate deals but he was an old friend so he propbably had no reason to question him. if debbie had been using part of the property he would only be able to lay claim to that in what he was using. Chris was on the land with what he thought was his. in some jusrisdictions they will require bad faith so he would possibly fail this element. for open and notorius the act must be visible actiual notice or constructive notice. the owner has a duty to inspect there property Betty failed in doing so and even went as far as forgetting that she had one. Betty though might claim that the turain is hilly and difficult to travel to and it would be impossible to be able to inspect the property as whole. Also she could have said if she would have seen the small rustic cabin it would have not been clear that someone else was living there at the time. Debbie though had bulit a large home and even cleared trees that would have put the owner on notice that someone was using the land. Also the courts will likely want to allow debbie to keep the home due to the fact that she has worked hard to rebuild the home and to plant a garden in the yard. They would want to make sure that there property intrest was protected after they had devoted much of their life to the propery and helped cultivate the land. Adverse possesion is meant tp prevent people from just sitting on land and not doing anything. some might see adverse possession as theft but it is imbeded in property values that are there to serve human values. John locke believed we all have property in ourselves and our labor should be rewarded Debbies work should be rewarded for what she has done. due to this they will grant debiie the whole of the property under color of title and due to the fact that the fact that she has worked hard to rebuild the home and to plant a garden in the yard. They would want to make sure that there property intrest was protected after they had devoted much of their life to the propery and helped cultivate the land.

8ba9d30a-008d-4ada-b6fe-989f3a250926," Olivers children have a contingent remainder in life estate. He has two children that are alive but the first to retire is a conditioin precedent. Robert has a vested remiander in life estate. Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple Vivian has an executory interest. The Rule against perpetuities applies to exectory interests, contingent remainders, and vested remainders subject to open. The RAP stays that an interest must vest of fail within 21 years of a life in being when the interest is created. In this case the interest is created as soon as Oliver writes the grant. The contingent remainder in Oliver's children does violate RAP because one of Oliver's could have a child. Then die. Then his two children living Connor and Carla, and his grandchildren, and robert could die. The the child who was just born could work and not retire within 21 years of any of the lives in being. Victor's vested remainder subject to open and Vivians executory interest would be invalid under RAP. The class will not close until Oliver's last child dies. If everyone alive at the time of the grant dies except Oliver, then Oliver has a child and dies. His child can have a child but that baby will not turn 25 with in 21 years of Olivers death, the last validating life. The grant would be re-worded to robert for life. This will leave a reversion in fee simple to Oliver. "," A. Tenancy in Common The issue in this case is whether Brock will be able to paritition from his tenancy in common with Alex. Since Brock and Alex are co-tenants in a tenancy in common they both have a seperate fractional undivided interest in the propety. Since the developer wants to purchase the warehouse and 10 acres, Brock will have to communicte with Alex and try to convince him to sell. It appears that Alex is unintereseted in selling, the best option would be to an action for partition. A partition is legal action to divide the interests in the property. There are two types of partitions. A partition in kind is a physical partition. The court will split up the land equitable between the two cotenants. The other type of partition is a partition by sale. A partition by sale is permitted by the court when a partition in kind is impracticable and the interests of the cotenants will be satisfied. In a parition by sale the cotentants get a share of the sale funds. Brock will likely move for a partition by sale since he wants to make the most money possible off the property. However, it is likely Alex will argue for a partition by kind so he can keep the warehouse and on site tasting room. The burden of proving that a partition in kind is impracticable will be on Brock. He will have to prove that there is no equitable way to split up the property becasue the value of the warehouse and restaurant is probaly greater than the other 10 acres. It is unclear if the reaturant and tasting room expanded onto the 10 acres in which case Brock would have a stronger argument. Brock can also argue that both interests are satisfied by a partition by sale because they amount of money recieved would be enough for Alex to start a new brewery somewhere else. Alex will argue that he has sentimental value in the brewery. Since it is his livelihood and he has sentimental value and since courts have a preference to partitions in kind, it is likely Alex has a stronger argument in court. (Delfinos v. Vealencis) Brocks other option is to sell his interest in the property to the developers. In this case, the devlopers and Alex would be tenants in common. Brock would not make as much money because the devloper would be more interested in the whole property than a fractional share in an unidivded interest. B. Coins, Growler, Coat Brocks other option is to sell his interest in the property to the developers. In this case, the devlopers and Alex would be tenants in common. Brock would not make as much money because the devloper would be more interested in the whole property than a fractional share in an unidivded interest. B. Coins, Growler, Coat Dear Carl, In regards to the coins, the issue is whether they are considered mislaid or abandoned property. Mislaid property is property that is intentially placed somewhere and unintentionally left. Usually this occurs when someone forgets where they placed something. Mislaid property first and foremost belongs to the true owner, and then to the property owner where it is found. The rationale behind this is that the true owner will eventually come back to the place where they left their property. Abandoned property however is property that is intentionally left behind. The true owner relinguishes all rights and the possessor becomes the new owner. The nature of coins is different than real property and could also in some jurisdictions be recognized as treasure trove, in which case the finder becomes the owner against everyone besides the true owner. You will want to argue that these coins were abandoned by the original owner. It is possible that whoever had the coins before wanted to get rid of them, possibly becuase they were taken in bad faith. In this case, they could be considered abandoned and the finder becomes the owner. Unfortunately for you it is more likely that this property was mislaid. Similarly to the property found the the aircraft in Benjamin v. Lindner Aviations, the coins were wrapped in a mesh grocery bag. In the Lindner case, the currency was considered mislaid and belonged to the owner of the property where it was found, the bank who owned the plane. The interest was good against everyone except the true owner. In this case, if the coins are considered mislaid, then they would belong to the property where you found them, the brewery so Alex and Brock. It is possible that the true owner is the grocery store. In this case the mislaid property would belong to the grocery store if they came back to claim the coins. Traditionally, a property owner owns all property found on his/her land. Therefore, Alex and Brock likely have the best claim to the coins. In regards to your coat and growler, the issue is whether you mislaid, abandoned, or lost them. It is possible that the coat will be considered abandonded because you intentionally left without it and In this case the mislaid property would belong to the grocery store if they came back to claim the coins. Traditionally, a property owner owns all property found on his/her land. Therefore, Alex and Brock likely have the best claim to the coins. In regards to your coat and growler, the issue is whether you mislaid, abandoned, or lost them. It is possible that the coat will be considered abandonded because you intentionally left without it and appeared to have no interest in possessing it any longer. However it is possible that the coat was mislaid, similar to the purse in McAvoy v. Medina becuase it was intentionally placed on the hooks in the brewery but forget which hook or where exactly he placed in. Mislaid property is distinguishable from abandoned property based on location. A coat rack is a normal place to put a coat and since it is possible you just did not see it because you were distracted, the coat would remain in possession to the true owner. Abandoned property, is placed somewhere like a trash bin, where there are clear intentions to part from it. The best arguement for the coat is that it is lost. Lost property is property that was unintentionally place and the true owner can not find. Lost property belongs first and formost to the true owner, then to the first possessor. If you could not find your coat on the coat rack, it is likely you placed in somehwere else unintentionally. In this case you still have the superior claim to the coat over whoever may have found it. The growler is tricky because it was likely broken and the pieces were disgarded. It is unclear from the facts whethere the growler that broke was actually yours. If it was not you could argue mislaid property or lost property. It is likely that the growler will be considered lost property since you are unsure where it is. You still have ownershhip to the growler if it is found. C. The first deed: David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation. This means that David has a fee simple unless he uses the land for anything other than residential use. The future interest is granted to a third party, Frank and Fred have an executory interest in fee simple in the 5 acres. The issue is whether David used the property for non-residential use. In 2017, David plans to build a development with residential use and commercial use. The condition is not broken until the property in actually used for non-residential purposes. It is unclear in the facts whether the building has been changed yet, but it is likely that if David follows through with the plan the condition will be broken, and Alex's sons will have a right a present fee simple absolute in the property. third party, Frank and Fred have an executory interest in fee simple in the 5 acres. The issue is whether David used the property for non-residential use. In 2017, David plans to build a development with residential use and commercial use. The condition is not broken until the property in actually used for non-residential purposes. It is unclear in the facts whether the building has been changed yet, but it is likely that if David follows through with the plan the condition will be broken, and Alex's sons will have a right a present fee simple absolute in the property. The second deed: Edward has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. This is because the reversion is back to the grantor. The language in this deed is ambiguous. It uses the langiage of both duration ""so long as"" and conditon ""if"" and ""right to re-enter"". The issue is whether Alex intended to convey a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. If he intened to convey a fee simple determinable his future interest would be a possiblity of reverter, which would automatically occur if Ed started making IPAs. If he intended to create a fee simple subject to conditon subsequent the future interest is a right of reentry, which he would have to actual reclaim. In cases of ambiguous language courts tend to favor fee simple subject to condition subsequent, becasue there is a policy implication not to automatically force someone off property. Therefore in this case it is more likely that a right of reentry was created and when Ed started making IPAs Alex will be able to reclaim the 5 acres he conveyed to Ed. "," The issue in this case is first whether Debbie and Chris acquired Greenacre through adverse possession. To acquire property though adverse possesion the statute of limitations to reclaim property must have run and the five common law requirements of adverse possession must be satisfied. The five requirements are (1) actual (2) open/notorious (3) hostile/adverse (4) exclusive and (5) continuous. The actual requirment is satisfied if the adverse possessor is physical on the property and uses it how a reasonable owenr would. The open/notorious requirment is satisfied if the true owner would reaonbley be on notice that someone else was on the land.

Some jurisdictions require a subjective good faith requirement, which looks for the possessor to mistakenly beliebve the propety is their or a bad faith rewquirmetn whrere the possessor knows the property is not theirs but wants to possess it anyway.

The exclusive requirment is satisified whrn the possessor uses the property for themself and without the true owner. And it is continuous if the possessor uses the property regularly during the staturoty period how a reasonable owner would. The first issue is whether Chris's possession was hostile. Chris does not have a good argument for adverse possession in 2001 because he was on the land with permission. Debie could argue that Chris adverse possession started in 2004 becuase he was on the land without Betty's permission and when Andrew died, the land went fully to Betty through right of survivorship. Andrew and Betty were tenants by the entirety. Tenancy by entirety is similar to tenants in common but includes a right of survivorship. To form a tenancy by the entirety, the language must be clear indicating the desire to form tenacny by the entirety and the four unities must be met. The four unities are time (interest conveyed simulataneously), title (through the same intrument), interest (the same undivided property), and possession(at the time of conveyance had the right to possess all the property). If any of the unities are broken the tenancy by the entirety becomes a tenancy in common. Andrew did not sever the tenancy by the entirety when he sold Greenacre to Chris because he falsely signed her name. He could have unilaterally severed the interest before but he didnt. Debbie will be able to argue Chris was actually on the land by his use and improvement to the cabin. The continuous requirment will be difficult for Debbie to prove for Chris because he was only there for 8 weeks per year. She could argue that this is normal use of a cabin in the woods. Chris' use was exclusive of the true owner during his years using the property. Finally Chris would have to argue that his use was open/notorious. It was a cabin and a reasonable property owner would be on notice that a cabin was being occupied. Another issue is whether Debbie met the SOL period. The SOL is 10 years and Debbie was given Greenacre in 2009. She could tack on Chris's years becasue it was passed down to here in privity. Howver, Betty has a better arguement that Debbie cannot tack because the possession was not continuous. Debbie did not start living on Greeneacre until 2011. Her adverse possession did not start until 2011 which is only 8 years ago. Debbie was actually on the property though as evidence by the house she built. Her possession was hostile under7colorof title, she was there without Betty's permission and believed she was the rightful owner. Her possesson was open/notorious becuase a reasonable owner would be on notice someone was occupying the property when a house was built. Greenacre in 2009. She could tack on Chris's years becasue it was passed down to here in privity. Howver, Betty has a better arguement that Debbie cannot tack because the possession was not continuous. Debbie did not start living on Greeneacre until 2011. Her adverse possession did not start until 2011 which is only 8 years ago. Debbie was actually on the property though as evidence by the house she built. Her possession was hostile under color of title, she was there without Betty's permission and believed she was the rightful owner. Her possesson was open/notorious becuase a reasonable owner would be on notice someone was occupying the property when a house was built. Her possession was exclusive on the two acres were her house was lcoated. Her possession was continuous becasue she lived there full time. Debbie meets the 5 common law requirments of adverse possession. The court will likley find that under color of title she can occupy the two acres where her house is located and the rest will go to Betty. ",245,1610,902
f7a4a46d-b331-4eb7-aa29-d71c831238a7," Before we apply Rule Against Perpetuities, the interests are as follows. The first interest, ""to the first of my children to retire, for life"" is a contingent remainder in a life estate, because while Oliver has two children who are ascertained, neither of them are retired therefore have not fulfilled the condition, ""to retire,"" set by Oliver. It is in a life estate because of the words ""for life."" The next interest, ""then to my nephew Robert for life,"" is a vested remainder in life estate because Robert is alive and there is no condition set that would stop him from getting the interest in the future, he just has to exist, which he does. It is in a life estate because of the words ""for life."" The final interest, ""then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25"" is a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple because Oliver has two grandchildren who are alive, Victor and Vivian. It is vested since Victor is 26 and has already met the condition of being age 25. It is subject to open because Oliver could have more grandchildren. It is a fee simple because there are no words of duration such as, ""for life."" The Rule Against Perprtuities requries that an interest must vest or fail within 21 years of a life in being at the time of the grant, otherwise the interest is void. The first interest is void because the interest has the potential to vest too remotely in the future. For example, if Oliver has a child Z today, and then Oliver and his first two children die tomorrow, Z could retire 50 years from now, which would violate the life in being and 21 years requirement. Z cannot be his own life in being since he was not alive at the time of the grant. If this were Oliver's will, it would be a valid interest because when Oliver died his class of children would be closed, and they could all be their own life in being, so we would know who would be the first to retire and still satisfy the RAP. The second interest is valid because RAP does not apply to Robert's vested remainder in life estate. The third interest would ordinarily be invalid under RAP because if Oliver had a third grandchild, then everybody dies, the third grandchild would not turn 25 within a life in being or 21 years, since he cannot be his own life in being because he was not alive at the time of the grant. But the rule of conveinence saves this otherwise invalid interest. The rule of conveinence allows this to be valid since one of Oliver's of children would be closed, and they could all be their own life in being, so we would know who would be the first to retire and still satisfy the RAP. The second interest is valid because RAP does not apply to Robert's vested remainder in life estate. The third interest would ordinarily be invalid under RAP because if Oliver had a third grandchild, then everybody dies, the third grandchild would not turn 25 within a life in being or 21 years, since he cannot be his own life in being because he was not alive at the time of the grant. But the rule of conveinence saves this otherwise invalid interest. The rule of conveinence allows this to be valid since one of Oliver's alive grandchildren already satisfies the requirement, Victor who is age 26. Therefore this allows Victor and any other grandchildren alive at the time of the grant to be able to take the interest, even if they aren't 25 yet. So Vivian, even though she is 17, will be able to still have the interest when she turns 25. But the class is closed at the time of the grant. So no other grandchildren born can have the interest under the rule of conveinence. Therefore only Victor and Vivian will be able to take the interest when it comes time. "," 1a. Brock The issue here is what type of co-ownership Brock and Alex have together. The deed Alex signed stating is ambiguous as it says ""jointly as tenants in common."" This language is contradicting because of the difference between Joint Tenancy and Tenants in Common. A joint tenancy requries that the deed reference some sort of language stating it to be a joint tenancy, such as ""joint tenants"" or ""joint tenants with the right of survivorship."" Tenancy in common does not require this langauge and is the default type of co-ownership when there is no language that tells otherwise. The problem here is that Alex's deed says ""jointly"" and ""tenants in common."" I will analyze below for you why this makes a difference, how each one functions, and the result depending on how the court rules. If the deed were to be construed to make Alex and Brock joint tenants, it means that there is a right of surviviorship and the deed was created with the four unities. The right of survivorship is unique to joint tenancy and is not found with tenancy in common. The right of surviorship means that if one of the tenants were to die their interest would cease to exist and the other tenant(s) would carry on with their undivided interest(s) being able to avoid probate. The four unities are time, title, possession, and at the same time for all parties involved. The interest. To satisfy time, the joint tenancy must be3made would be satisfied as Alex and Brock agreed to the deed at the same time by Brock accepting and paying Alex money for half of the business and warehouse. Next is title which means that all tenants are surviviorship and the deed was created with the four unities. The right of survivorship is unique to joint tenancy and is not found with tenancy in common. The right of surviorship means that if one of the tenants were to die their interest would cease to exist and the other tenant(s) would carry on with their undivided interest(s) being able to avoid probate. The four unities are time, title, possession, and interest. To satisfy time, the joint tenancy must be made at the same time for all parties involved. The would be satisfied as Alex and Brock agreed to the deed at the same time by Brock accepting and paying Alex money for half of the business and warehouse. Next is title which means that all tenants are brought together in joint tenancy through the same instrument. Here, this unitiy is borderline because Brock agreed to the partnership by paying money and Alex signed a deed. One argument would be that these aren't through the same instruments, since the money tied Brock to the deal and a deed tied Alex. But one could also argue that the deed was an document bringing the two together officialy after Brock's monetary investment, therefore making it the instrument. Next unity is possession, which means that all tenants have equal, undivided possession and use of the jointly owned property. This seems to be satisfied until Brock throws Alex out of the brewery. Finally, the interest unity means that when the joint tenancy is created, all tenants have an equal interest in the whole of the property. This is satisfied since it was decided that both have interests in the property. To sever a joint tenancy, one must sever one of the four unities, typically by granting their interest to someone else (a strawman), then getting that interest back as a tenancy in common or the modern trend of granting your own interest to yourself as a tenancy in common. If the deed were to be construed as a tenancy in common, then the right of survivorship doesn't apply, you do not need the four unities, and you can sever by asking the court for a partition in kind or a partition by sale. The court will most likely construe the deed as a tenancy in common because the deed language is ambiguious, and the court tends to default to tenancy in common. Also, because the language does not include ""with a right of survivorship"" which is the key distinguishing feature of a joint tenancy. Tenants in common still have an fractional, undivided interest in the whole property. It is undivided in the terms of money (mortgage, proceeds of sale), but undivided when it comes to use. Since Brock wants out of the deal and sell the land completely off to the developers, he would have to argue a partion by sale to the court. A partition by sale is when the court orders that all parties sell the jointy owned property and then proceeds are divided up among the tenants. On the other side of that is tend a partion in kind. A partition in kind is what courts to favor when partitioning. This is when the court physically divides up the land and gives equal separate shares to the tenants. The court favors this so they do not have to force people to sell their land, as what occurs in a partition by sale. But a court of money (mortgage, proceeds of sale), but undivided when it comes to use. Since Brock wants out of the deal and sell the land completely off to the developers, he would have to argue a partion by sale to the court. A partition by sale is when the court orders that all parties sell the jointy owned property and then proceeds are divided up among the tenants. On the other side of that is a partion in kind. A partition in kind is what courts tend to favor when partitioning. This is when the court physically divides up the land and gives equal separate shares to the tenants. The court favors this so they do not have to force people to sell their land, as what occurs in a partition by sale. But a court will order the partition by sale, when the three following conditions are met: there are physical attributes which would make a partition impracticable, the sale benefits at least one of the parties, and the sale does not predjudice any of the parties. Here, there are no facts to support that there are any landmarks which would make the partition impracticable, as the court could make the brewery and restaurant one parcel and the other acres another. But you would have to worry about the values of each, and the brewery site might be more valuable than just the empty land. Next, the sales have to benefit at least one party. Here the sale would benefit both parties a lot, as Brock has stated $2 million is well more than the worth of the property. Finally, the sale cannot predjudice any party. This is Alex's best case because of how much time, energy, and money he has exerted into this brewery. It is his dream to own this business and he is finally succeeding at it. Brock would argue that Alex would not be predjudiced as he would have enough money from the sale to continue his business, just somewhere else. The sale would not close his business and they both would come out the other side equitably better off. Alex would rebut and say there is no need to move his business, he is very successful where he is now and moving might hinder that. The court will likely order a partion in kind, and let Brock sell off the unused acres and let Alex keep his brewery, as the predjudiced against Alex would be too great. Also if the court wished to pursue the public policy of rewarding energy and resources into bettering the community they would allow Alex to keep his brewery where it is. The facts state that Bostonia is a growing city and his brewery could be playing a part in that, as a developer is willing to pay top dollar for property in Bostonia. Brock could then argue that he deserves rent from Alex from being oustered. In Martin, co-tenants do not owe rent to one another unless there is an agreement to pay or there is an ouster. Brock's argument that he is being ousted lies in the fact that Alex kicked him out of the property and said don't come back. This is violating Brock's right to the use of the property as a tenant in common. Therefore he could demand rent from Alex. 1b. Carl Possession -- coins to one another unless there is an agreement to pay or there is an ouster. Brock's argument that he is being ousted lies in the fact that Alex kicked him out of the property and said don't come back. This is violating Brock's right to the use of the property as a tenant in common. Therefore he could demand rent from Alex. 1b. Carl Possession -- coins The first issue for Carl is the right of possession to the found property of gold coins. Under Armory, the finder has a claim to the property that is good against the world except for the true owner. Carl's right to the coins depends on what type of found property the coins are classified as. There are four types: lost, abandoned, mislaid, and treasure trove. Lost means that the owner unintentionally parts ways with the property and doesn't know where it is. The property then belongs to the true owner foremost, then to the finder, then subsequent finders, etc. Abandoned means the owner intentionally relinquishes all ownership rights. The property then belongs to the finder, even if the true owner decides he wants it back. Mislaid means the owner intentionally placed the property somewhere but forgot where. McAvoy, Linder Aviation. This rule applies even if it is unlikely the true owner will return. The property belongs foremost to the owner, then to the landowner which the property was found. A finder has no claim. Finally, a treasure trove is when the owner intentionally hids coins or currency. Corliss. The property goes to the finder. Carl's best argument for obtaining the right to possession of the gold coins is claimining they are abandoned or a treasure trove. He would aruge they are abandoned because the owner decided to chose to leave behind the coins in a bag. He would also argue that they are a treasure trove as that specifically states the owner hides coins or currency. Here the coins are wrapped in a bag, and hid in the wall, the entry to the wall being inconspious. The coins being a treasure trove is Carl's best argument. The rebuttal would be that since they are old, valuable, and specifically placed in the wall they should follow Linder Aviation and go to the landowner. If the court does not recognize treasure trove like in Linder Aviation, then the coins will go to the landowner, Alex and Brock. If the court recognizes treasure trove, then the coins belong to Carl. Bailement -- growler The issue here is if there was a bailement relationship created when the the bar took possession of the growler. Under Allen majority rule, a bailement was created when the garage was enclosed, required a fee ticket to exit, and had security. The Allen dissent said that a bailement only occurs when the bailee like in Linder Aviation, then the coins will go to the landowner, Alex and Brock. If the court recognizes treasure trove, then the coins belong to Carl. Bailement -- growler The issue here is if there was a bailement relationship created when the the bar took possession of the growler. Under Allen majority rule, a bailement was created when the garage was enclosed, required a fee ticket to exit, and had security. The Allen dissent said that a bailement only occurs when the bailee takes full possession of the object. To recover the costs of the broken growler, Carl would argue that there was a bailment relationship created when he was handed a ticket and a tag with a corresponding number was attached to the growler. That the ticket recognized the bar taking possession like the fee ticket said the hotel garage had possession of the car as it did in Allen. The bar's rebuttal would be that the ticket is not enough to state a bailment claim. They would argue the Allen dissent that they never took full possession of the growler, as Carl never left the premises. The facts are also a bit ambiguious as to what happened to the growler. It is not definite that his is the glass that was being swept up. Carl left before he got a certain answer. The court will most likely rule that this was not a bailment, as there is not definite proof the bar neglected their duty of care over the growler Possession -- jacket The issue is the rights of possession Carl has to his coat he cannot find. First the jacket would have to be found in order for Carl to make arguments, but if it is found then Carl would argue he mislaid the jacket. Here, if the jacket was mislaid, as in Carl placed is somewhere then forget where, it belongs foremost to him and then the landowner where the jacket was found. Like in McAvoy where the pocketbook was left in the barbershop, it belonged to the shop owner over the finder of the pocketbook. If this is the case, then Carl has the most superior claim to the jacket. Carl could also aruge that the jacket was stolen, and he would still have the rightful claim as the owner has a better claim to something than the theif, even if there is a finder in between. The true owner has the foremost claim. 1c. David In the deed to David, the first interest is David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation because David's present possessory interest in fee simple is subject to a words of duration, ""so long as."" Therefore is the acres are ever used for non-residental purposes then the interest will be cut short by an executory interest. The second interest is Frank and Fred have a shifting executory interest, because 1c. David In the deed to David, the first interest is David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation because David's present possessory interest in fee simple is subject to a words of duration, ""so long as."" Therefore is the acres are ever used for non-residental purposes then the interest will be cut short by an executory interest. The second interest is Frank and Fred have a shifting executory interest, because they are a third party therefore it is executory and not a possibility of reverter and shifting because it is not cutting short the grantor's interest, but a grantee's. Alex could claim that David's present possessory interest no longer exists and now belongs to his sons Frank and Fred once David violates the interest's duration condition. But they only get their interest once David has actually used the property for non- residental purposes, plans are not enough to break the condition. In the deed to Edward, the interest is Edward has a fee simple determinable because if the duration condition is broken it is reverted back to the grantor not a third party. If it were a third party then it would be executory. Alex has a possibility of reverter because if the interest condition is broken if reverts back to him, the grantor. Alex would have a claim against Edward that as soon as Edward started making IPAs, Alex's interest automitcally kicked in and he again re-claims the property. "," Arguments for Betty The issue here is who has the right of possession over Greenacre, Betty or Debbie. Since Betty and Andrew owned the property as tenants by the entirey, they could not unitaterlly sell off the property. They had to mutually agree to sell their interest. Betty would argue that Chris never had the property rights to Greenacre because Andrew sold the property not consistent with the requirements of a tenancy by the entirety. Betty did not know Andrew did that as he forged her signature, therefore it was not a mutual decision. Betty would argue under the subjective standard of bad faith requirment for hostility. As seen in Dombkowski, one must be acting in bad faith and know that they are using property that is not theirs. And that Debbie's claim for AP is deafeated because she does not satisfy hostile. To defeat a AP claim, you only need to disprove at least one of the required elements. But this argument if not very strong as the majority rule is objective and does not focus on 10subjetive mental state of the claimant, but rather the the inquiry centers on their manifestitations of adverse use. Betty would argue under the subjective standard of bad faith requirment for hostility. As seen in Dombkowski, one must be acting in bad faith and know that they are using property that is not theirs. And that Debbie's claim for AP is deafeated because she does not satisfy hostile. To defeat a AP claim, you only need to disprove at least one of the required elements. But this argument if not very strong as the majority rule is objective and does not focus on the subjetive mental state of the claimant, but rather the inquiry centers on their manifestitations of adverse use. Betty would also argue that Debbie does not use the property exclusively as she lets neighbors hunt and fish as they wish. But she doesn't allow them on the land around her house, therefore she uses that portion exclusively. Arguments for Debbie Debbie would argue that Chris did not know the signature was forged, and since it was she should gain the party of the property that she uses through color of title. Color of title says that when someone obtains property in good faith through a faulty document, such as no/bad signature or mistaken description, then that person should be awarded the parcel of property that they have been residing on as their own. Here, Debbie would get the two-acres around her home that she uses. Debbie would argue that she has gained the property through adverse possession. The elements of adverse possession are the statute of limitations has run, and the adverse possessor satisfies open and notorious, actual, hostile, exclusive, and continuous. The statue of limitations in New Suffolk is ten years. Chris gained title in 2001 and Debbie started living on the property in 2011. Betty discovered Debbie in 2019, which is 18 years later. This element is satisfied because tacking allows Debbie to add her father's time onto hers, since they were in privity. Tacking requires privity, the voluntary transfer of property, or when the property is not transfered from another adverse possessor or through foreclosure. Open and notorious requires that the true owner be on actual notice of the adverse possessor's use. Debbie would argue that Betty should have been on notice as it is one of her properties and her duty to check on it relatively often. Actual requries that Debbie be physically present, which is satisfied as Debbie lives there full-time and has a house on the property. Hostile requries the AP to be using the property without permission of the actual owner. Debbie did not know of Betty and that there was another owner, therefore this is satisfied. Exclusive requires that the AP is using the property as if it was their own, exlcuding strangers, but can allow visitors. Debbie satisfies this because she uses the9 property as her full-time home, with a garden, and cleared trees, and doesn't allow the neighbors to hunt and enter without her permission, but they can use the surrounding property as they wish which is entirely exclusive. Continuous requires that the AP uses Debbie be physically present, which is satisfied as Debbie lives there full-time and has a house on the property. Hostile requries the AP to be using the property without permission of the actual owner. Debbie did not know of Betty and that there was another owner, therefore this is satisfied. Exclusive requires that the AP is using the property as if it was their own, exlcuding strangers, but can allow visitors. Debbie satisfies this because she uses the property as her full-time home, with a garden, and cleared trees, and doesn't allow the neighbors to hunt and enter without her permission, but they can use the surrounding property as they wish which is entirely exclusive. Continuous requires that the AP uses the property frequently relative to the property. Meaning if it is a summer house, you do not need to be there year-round. Spending three months on the property is enough. Debbied satisfies this as she uses the property as her full-time home. The court will likely partially grant Debbie's claim for adverse possession for her house and the surrounding two acres as she meets all of the required elements, but the property was orignially obtained by her father through a faulty deed so Betty will likely get possession of the remainder of the property.

dcef7f09-f784-48cb-b65e-59d0293f4195," Oliver's Interests: Oliver does not have a reversion in fee simple. This is because Victor already satisfies his vested remainder. In other words, if Connor, Carlo, and Robert all died before they could obtain their future interests for life, Victor's vested remainder would be satisfied and he would have a present possessory interest in a fee simple absolute. Connor's Interests: Connor has a contingent remainder in a life estate, because it is not yet ascertained which child will retire first. Carla's Interests: Carla also has a contingent remainder in a life estate, because it is yet to be seen if Carlo or Connnor will retire first. Robert's Interests: Robert has an indfeasbily vested remainder in a life estate, because robert has no condition precedent to satisfy to obtain his future interest in a life estate. Victor's Interests (26): Victor's future interest in the conveyance is a vested remainder subject to partial divestment in a fee simple absolute. Victor's future interest is vested, because the conveyance requires that the grandchild be 25, which Victor already satisfies. The interest is subject to partial divestment, because Vivian is 17 and in the future she may turn 25 and take her share of the fee simple. Vivian's Interests (17): Vivian has a shifting executory interest in a fee simple aboslute. Vivian's interest is in a fee simple, because the conveyance state's, ""then to my grandchildren conjunctively and without anything suggesting it is just for life. Vivian's future interest is a shifting executory interest because if and when she turns 25, she will have a present possessory interest in the fee simple that another grantee, Victor, has already satisfied. Rule Against Perpetuties: Connor, Carla, Victor, and Vivian's future interests would all be subject to the rule against perpetutieis, becase the rule applies to contingent remainders, vested remainders subject to partial divestment (subject to open), and executory interests. The purpose of the rule against perpetuties dates back to English Common law, whent he courts sought to prevent dead hand control. Dead hand control refers to a conveyor or devisor creating instructions that subject future another grantee, Victor, has already satisfied. Rule Against Perpetuties: Connor, Carla, Victor, and Vivian's future interests would all be subject to the rule against perpetutieis, becase the rule applies to contingent remainders, vested remainders subject to partial divestment (subject to open), and executory interests. The purpose of the rule against perpetuties dates back to English Common law, whent he courts sought to prevent dead hand control. Dead hand control refers to a conveyor or devisor creating instructions that subject future possessors to limits in alienability and ownership of property. The rule states that none of the three above listed future interests may persist beyond a life in being (validating life), plus 21 years. A validating life is a person that is alive at the time of the gran, who is tied to one or more of the future interests. In this conveyance, there is no issue with Carla or Connor's contingent remainders. This is because they are both alive at the time of the conveyance and thus they are validating lives. Another way to epxress this, is that their interests will necessary vest or fail within their lifetime, not exceeding the rule against perpetuties limit. Robert's vested remainder in a life estate is not subject to the RAP, because it is not one of the three interests listed above. The conveyance of ""to my granchildren that reach the age of 25 violates the RAP. This is because Oliver could have another child ""X"" after the conveyance. This child ""X"" would not be a life in being because they were born after the grant. If all of the lives in being for this grant died (Carla, Connor, Robert, and Vivian), that child (X) could then have a grandchild of Oliver. The granchild would then have to turn 25 to obtain the fee simple. This would violate the rule against perpetuties, because All the validating lives had deceased and more than 21 years passed. Modern Policy Considerations (rule of convienence): The rule of convenience refers to future interest holders that have a vested remainder subject to partial divestment (open) in either a fee simple or life estate. This future interest is subject to another grantee's shifting executory interest in the remainder that they may receive of the fee once they possess it. When a vested remainder subject to open violatees the rule against perpetuities, he rule of convenience allows for the interest holder that satisfies the condition in the grant to retain their interest. At that time the class would be closed, and the executory interest holder would no longer have a valid future interest. Given Victor's vested remainder subject to open violates the RAP, a court may allow for the rule of convenience to close the class and allow Victor his vested remainder to be a ""vested remainder in a fee simple absolute. This is because Victor already satifies the condition of being 25 i.e. he is 26 years old at the time of the conveyance. This would also result in Vivian having no shifting executory interest in the rule against perpetuities, he rule of convenience allows for the interest holder that satisfies the condition in the grant to retain their interest. At that time the class would be closed, and the executory interest holder would no longer have a valid future interest. Given Victor's vested remainder subject to open violates the RAP, a court may allow for the rule of convenience to close the class and allow Victor his vested remainder to be a ""vested remainder in a fee simple absolute. This is because Victor already satifies the condition of being 25 i.e. he is 26 years old at the time of the conveyance. This would also result in Vivian having no shifting executory interest in the fee simple, even if she turned 25 eventually. "," 1(a): Dear Brock, I have had some time to review you and your brother's interests in the brewery, as well as several issues that might arise with the sale. The most important issue for your inquiry is the grant that was made by Alex. It appears the language stated you con-current tenants, ""jointly as tenants in common"". I'll explain the differences between joint tenancy and tenants in common below, as well as the resulting implications for your desire to sell. Joint Tenancy is a form of con-current tenancy wherein tenants retain an equal share of the same piece of property. Joint tenants also have a right of survivorship, meaning that if one tenant(s) dies, their property interest would instantaneously be given to the other joint tenant(s). Thus, joint tenancy is immune to probate. Joint tenancy typically requires that four unities are met; time; title; interest; and possession. The time unity requires that the joint tenants are granted the land at the same time. The title unity requires that the joint tenants are conveyed the land in the same document or conveyance/devise. The interest unity requires that joint tenants have a divided but equal interest in the property. The possession unity requires that joint tenants have equal rights to possess and use the given property in the conveyance. A joint tenant may unilaterally convey their interest in a joint tenancy, but this would severe the unity of title and thus create a tenancy in common for the receiving property holder. Historically one could use a strawman to convey 4their interest to and then have it conveyed back if they wished to be a tenant in common. The interest unity requires that joint tenants have a divided but equal interest in the property. The possession unity requires that joint tenants have equal rights to possess and use the given property in the conveyance. A joint tenant may unilaterally convey their interest in a joint tenancy, but this would severe the unity of title and thus create a tenancy in common for the receiving property holder. Historically one could use a strawman to convey their interest to and then have it conveyed back if they wished to be a tenant in common. Courts typically requrie a very explicit expression that a joint tenancy is being created, such as ""as joint tenants with the right of survivorship"". Some states, like Massachusetts will allow for more loose language like ""jointly as tenants"", but it's best to be very express in your intention to create one. The issue with the conveyance from Alex, is that it refers to you as tenants in common. Tenancy in common has no right of survivorship and allows for unequal property interests; the four unities do not apply and tenants in common may devise or convey their property interests freely. In order to sell your interest in the property, you will have to pettion a court for a partition in kind, or a partion by sale. Courts typically favor partition in kind, as there is less potential for an unwilling sale of proeprty from one co-tenant. If a partition did result in differing values, the court could allow an owelty payment from the tenant that received more value than their given share. On the other hand, a partition by sale, which is disfavored by courts will be made with the process of dividing the property would be impracticalbe due to some characteristic of the land (a river, geological feature), and all parties interests would be promoted by the sale. Courts will recognize a property owners personality interest in a given piece of property, such as a business they run (Delfino v. Vealencis) or if there is a child hood home or interest in the land. Since the court will likely consider your property interest to be a tenancy in common, you are free to convey your interest in the land. However, this will be difficult, given your property is a brewery and Alex is intent on running the business. You could petition the court for a partition in kind, but it will be difficult to metaphorically draw a line down the middle of the brewery and divide it. In that case, the court will entertain a partition by sale because the division would be impracticable. Then the court would assess if all of the tenants interests are promoted by the sale. Since your brother clearly stated, ""I love this place, and I'm not selling"", the court will likely see it as a personality interest that prevents them from forcing him to sell. However, since there is both a warehouse and 10 acres of land, the court may divide the property between you and Alex by partition in kind, allowing the developer to take the 10 acres in the back, and Alex to keep the warehouse and run the brewery. If the resulting value of this sale was much more than would assess if all of the tenants interests are promoted by the sale. Since your brother clearly stated, ""I love this place, and I'm not selling"", the court will likely see it as a personality interest that prevents them from forcing him to sell.

If the resulting value of this sale was much more than your 1/2 share in the property, the court may also force you to make an owelty payment to Alex. This is due to each of you having a 1/2 interest in $500,000 total at the time of the conveyance. Best, - Attorney 1(b): Dear Carl, I've had some time to review the information you provided me about the gold coins you recently found at the brewery. First I'll address the property interests surrounding the gold coins. Regarding the broken growler and the lost coat, there may be some differences between the breweries liability. For reference this relationship would be referred to hereafter as a bailment. I've also included some of the property interests that are typically connected to found property below . Regarding the gold coins, it appears you found them while on someone elses property. Furthermore, the local grocer's name on the bag suggest that someone nearby may have had possession prior. If the coins were truly lost property, meaning the coins were mistakenly or accidentally lost in that hole, you would be the rightful possessor of the coins over all others, except for the rightful owner. If the coins had been placed there intentionally, however, they would be considered mislaid property . Mislaid property means the prior owner intentionally placed an item somewhere and then forgot about it or failed to retrive it. In the instance of mislaid property, the property typically goes to the owner of the premises in which the property was mislaid. In your case it would be the brewery that would have a claim to the coins, regardleses of if the rightful owner ever returned to retrive them. The reasoning behind mislaid property is to allow for the rightful owner to re-trace their steps if they truly did just mislay the property. as they are not attached to features of There is no need to assess if the coins are embedded, geography, and rather they were located in a hold inside a brewery. Embedded property typically refers to property that is unearthered as in Corliss v. Wenner. Furthermore, treasure trove property would not premises in which the property was mislaid. In your case it would be the brewery that would have a claim to the coins, regardleses of if the rightful owner ever returned to retrive them. The reasoning behind mislaid property is to allow for the rightful owner to re-trace their steps if they truly did just mislay the property. There is no need to assess if the coins are embedded, as they are not attached to features of geography, and rather they were located in a hold inside a brewery. Embedded property typically refers to property that is unearthered as in Corliss v. Wenner. Furthermore, treasure trove property would not typically apply, since it is an english common law doctrine that was created after independence of the United States was declared. There issues with identfying which type of property the coins are, have to do with the nature of the place you found them. Since the coins were wrapped in a bag from a local grocer, it suggests that some care was taken by a person in the local area. Furthermore, since the coins were shoved into a small hole, it would suggest that a person intentiionally placed them there. It would be hard to suggest that someone lost this property, since it would've most likely been on the floor and then forced into the hole by mere happenstance. Courts typically have a difficult time assessing the nature of property between mislaid and lost in these instances. Since the placement highly suggests and agent kept those coins in the hole to return to them some day later, it is most likely the brewery will be the rightful possessor of them. If you were to sell the coins for $20,000, you would be in danger of the rightful owner, or the brewery, pursuing an action to recuperate. Since they might consider you a thief for taking mislaid property, you would not have voidable title to do so. Kotis v. Nowlin. Regarding the broken mug, a court will likely find a bailment relationship was established. This is due to the bartender's exchange of claim ticket. The claim ticket was clearly for your mug, and identified you as the owner, as the dissent referred to in Hyatt. Typically bailment relationships require a certain assumption of liablity, and the identification of both the bailor and bailee at the time of exchange. The brewery will be liable for your growler because they had an express bailment relationship with you. In regards to the coat, it will be more difficult to establish a bailment, sense there was no ticketing system you referred to. By placing the coat on the rack by yourself, it doesn't appear that you communicated with anyone in order to establish a bailment. However, if there was an employee watching the coats, and perhaps a counter in front of them suggesting a security personnel, there may an implied bailment relationship. This would be an argumen that placing your coat on the rack 7created be similar to the implied bailment that was established by the car garage in Hyatt. Since the garage had a security personnel, a single entrance and exit, and the security agents had been notified of theft-like In regards to the coat, it will be more difficult to establish a bailment, sense there was no ticketing system you referred to.

Since the garage had a security personnel, a single entrance and exit, and the security agents had been notified of theft-like activity, an implied bailment was established for the plaintiff's stolen car. A court may or may not grant you this kind of bailment, but a court will certainly find that there was a bailment for your growler. Best, - Attorney 1(c): Dear Alex, Thank for reaching out to my office. The main issue in your inquiry appears to be the conveyance of 2016. The language ""so long as the property is used for residential uses only"" suggests there is a fee simple determinable given to David. Fee simple determinables are defeasible fees that contain words of duration, like ""so long as"". However, the grant goes on to say, ""if it is ever used for non-residential uses, then..."". The language, ""if, or, ""but if"", suggest a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. In the event that the court determines it to be a fee simple determinable, Frank and Fred would have a possiblity of reverter. Frank and Fred's POR would mean that as soon as the durational condition was broken, the property would transfer to them. In the event that the court sees the conveyances a FSSCS, Frank and Fred would have a right of entry in the fee simple. A right of entry requires Frank and Fred to assert their claim to the land , whether to David directly or in court. Courts typically favor FSSCS, because it disallows old grants from reverting automatically if a durational condition is broken. A court will likely deem David's fee to be subject to condition subsequent, and thus Frank and Fred would have a right of re-entry. The court will also have to determine if partially using the land for housing, and the other half for commercial stores breaks the condition. Ambiguous language is also at issue with Edwards conveyance. Edward's grant contains language stating that the property may stay with him ""so long as"" IPAs are never made on the premises. Despite the language suggesting a fee simple determianble, the grant also contains language that Alex has a ""right automatically if a durational condition is broken. A court will likely deem David's fee to be subject to condition subsequent, and thus Frank and Fred would have a right of re-entry.

Despite the language suggesting a fee simple determianble, the grant also contains language that Alex has a ""right of re-entry"". The court will likely look at the grant overall. This is due to the rules of construction. In the case of ambiguous language, the rules of construction urge the court to look at the document as a whole, in order to more accurately understand the grantor's intent. Since you did include a clause saying ""right of re-entry"", and courts typically favor FSSCS, you will have the right to take back Edwards 5 acre parcel. In order to take back Edward's land, Frank and Fred would have to assert their legal claim to it. I've included everyones interests - insofar as how the court will view them - below for reference. Edward: Right of re-entry David: Present possessory interest in a fee simple subject to condition subsequent Alex: Present possessory interest in a fee simple subject to condition subsequent Frank and Fred: Right of re-entry. Best, -Attorney "," Andrew and Betty's tenancy in entirety is at issue in this case. A tenancy in entirety is a form of con- current tenancy that is very similar to joint tenancy. However, a tenancy in entirey must be made by spouses, regardless of gender, and neither tenant has the right to unilaterally convey the land. Conveyance thus requires the express consent of the other spouse. Similar to joint tenancy, a tenancy in entirety also allows for the right of survivorship, meaning that upon the death of one spouse, the estate or property would immediately transfer to the sole ownership of the other spouse; this means a tenancy in entirety is immune to probate. As the dissent in US v. Craft states, we have tenancy in entirety to protect family homes and allow one spouse immunity to the mistakes or bad behavior of another house. A tenancy entirety can only be severed by divorce, 13 consensual sale, or in grim circumstances, murder. Betty may argue that Andrew never had the right to sell Greenacre to Chris in the first place. Since entirety also allows for the right of survivorship, meaning that upon the death of one spouse, the estate or property would immediately transfer to the sole ownership of the other spouse; this means a tenancy in entirety is immune to probate. As the dissent in US v. Craft states, we have tenancy in entirety to protect family homes and allow one spouse immunity to the mistakes or bad behavior of another house. A tenancy entirety can only be severed by divorce, consensual sale, or in grim circumstances, murder. Betty may argue that Andrew never had the right to sell Greenacre to Chris in the first place. Since Andrew forged Betty's name on the deed and conveyed all 50 acres in secrecy. Furthermore, Betty would have a right to Greenacre due to the right of survivorship. Since Andrew passed away in 2004 and he and Betty never divorced, the entire 50 acres of Greenacre transferred to Betty, giveing her a present possessory interest in a fee simple absolute. The court will not assess lien theory or title theory, since the sale to Chris was in cash and didnt' create a mortgage interests whatsoever. Despite the above issues, Chris and Debbie may have argument that they adversely possessed part or the whole of Greenacre. Adverse possession is a form of title that occurs when a disseisor (someone adversely possessing) occupies a given parcel of land for the statutory period required and satisfies the five common law elements. The five common law elements require the disseisor to be open and notorious; continuous; exclusive; actual; and hostile in their possession. Open & Notorious means that the disseisor is acting in such a way that the rightful owner would be put on actual or constructive notice that they are occupying the land. Active notice would be something like building a structure, where as constructive notice would suggest that the rightful owner should have known that someone was adversely possessing. Continous possession requires that the disseisor be occupying the land throughout the statutory period without significant interruption. Exclusive possession means that the disseisor is the sole possessor of the porperty and gives permission to anyone else, such as guests. Actual possession refers to the disseisor using the property in the way it was intended, such as going on hunting trips at a hunting cabin. The final requirement, hostility, can be broken down into three different jurisdictional understandings, but refers to the idea that the disseisor must believe that he has superior title to the property over all others. Some states require good faith hostility, meaning that the disseisor was utterly unaware of any other rightful owner during the statutory period. bad-fath hostility requries that the disseisor was motivated by a conscious desire to take the property of another. However, the most common standard for hostility is the objective standard. In the objective standard, there is not inquiry as to the mental state of 10 outward the disseisor, and rather the court will look to their expressions. For example, the disseisor in Cahill v. Morrow sent an offer to purchase a lot, suggesting she may have not acted in a way that would comport with having superior title to the property. Some states require good faith hostility, meaning that the disseisor was utterly unaware of any other rightful owner during the statutory period. bad-fath hostility requries that the disseisor was motivated by a conscious desire to take the property of another. However, the most common standard for hostility is the objective standard. In the objective standard, there is not inquiry as to the mental state of the disseisor, and rather the court will look to their outward expressions. For example, the disseisor in Cahill v. Morrow sent an offer to purchase a lot, suggesting she may have not acted in a way that would comport with having superior title to the property. In the instant fact pattern, Chris would have to satisfy the above rule. A court will likely view Chris use of the proprty for for fishing as actual use, since that's what the property was intended for, and commonly used as. A court will find that Chris was open and notoroius in his use, since he gave constructive and actual notice by building onto the small wooden cabin and adding insulation. A court will find that Chris was also exclusive in his possession of greenacre, because he allowed others to use it with permission. The court will find that while Chris' use was intermittent, the actual nature of a hunting cabin only reqruired Chris to be continuous insofar as any person using a hunting cabin would do so. Regarding Chris hositliy, it is clear that he believed he had superior title since he gave permission to others to use it, and then unilaterally sold it to Debbie suggesting he had the title to transfer it. In an objective standard jurisdiction for hostility, Chris displayed no evidence during the statutory period that he doubted his title to the land as the purchase letter did in Cahill v. Morrow. In a good faith jurisdiction, Chris would certainly satisfy the hostility requirement, because by using the property as his own and transferring it, he was clearly unaware that Betty or anyone at all had a claim to it. However, in a bad faith jurisdiction, Chris may not have a calim to adverse posssession at all. Since Chris purchased the land from Andrew, and had no motivated to consciously take the property of another, he would not have been hostile under that theory. Ultimately, Chris argument for adverse possession will fail because he only occupied the land from 2001 to 2009, failing New Suffolk's Statutory requirement of 10 years. Despite that, Debbie would be able to argue adverse possesion via tacking with privity. Tacking refers to when one is adversely possessing land and then sells it to another. The purchaser is able to ""tack on"" the statutory period of the sellers possession, given the transfer was done volunatirly or with ""privity"". This was seen in Tieu v. Morgan, when the disputed driveway had been possessed by Morgans and the son who sold it to them. Debbie coudl argue that she satisfies tacking with privity, because she can add Chris' 9 years to occupation from 2011 to 2019, resulting in a total of 17 years. However, Betty may find issue with this, consdiering the tacking period was interupted from 2009 to 2011. This would suggest that the adverse possession was not continuous. land and then sells it to another. The purchaser is able to ""tack on"" the statutory period of the sellers possession, given the transfer was done volunatirly or with ""privity"". This was seen in Tieu v.

Debbie coudl argue that she satisfies tacking with privity, because she can add Chris' 9 years to occupation from 2011 to 2019, resulting in a total of 17 years. However, Betty may find issue with this, consdiering the tacking period was interupted from 2009 to 2011. This would suggest that the adverse possession was not continuous. Despite this issue with continuity, Debbie will argue that her posession was open and notorious because she built a ""lovely formal garden"" and cleared the the nearby trees. Debbie's arguments for actual posession will be that she lived in a year round house as someone normally would. Betty could argue that the land is actually intended for hunting and fishing, which she does neither of. Debbie's arguments for hostility will be that Greenacre was devised in her father's will, suggesting she believed she had a superior title to it. An issue with Debbie's possession will be that she allows others to use the 48 acres not by her house without permission. Debbie only requires permission for the 2 acres she occupies, suggesting that she does meet the common law requirement of exclusivity. Debbie's biggest issues with claiming adverse possession will be with continuity, exclusivity, and actual possession. If the court does not find issue with the lack of continuity in Debbie's posession, they will have to address the defective title that was transfered from Chris' invalid purchase from Andrew. Under color of title theory, someone that is adverseley possession land, while the rightful owner is not on it, will have a right to the entire property given under the title. Alternatively, if someone is adverseley possessing under color of title, and the rightful owner is on the land, they will only have a right to the portion of the land that they are using. In the instant case, it is stated that Debbie was only using 2 acres of land. Despite this limited use, it is reported Betty has never been to Greenacre. This would suggest that the rightful property owner was never on the land while she was possessing via color of title. If the court upheld Debbie's title, she would have right to the entire 50 acres. This case will essentially hinge upon Chris' hostility and what theory they will apply (good faith, bad faith, or objective standard); the courts decisions on Debbie's claim of adverse posession via tacking with privity, and the issues with continuity, actual use, and exclusivity, and; Betty's absence from the property gives Debbie the entire 50 acres under color of title.

The issue is whether or not Brock could make any money from the developer's offer while he is a tenant in common. Brock and Alex have a tenancy in common in the property which means they both have a 2) 1A. The issue is whether or not Brock could make any money from the developer's offer while he is a tenant in common. Brock and Alex have a tenancy in common in the property which means they both have a right to possess and use the entire property, but they split profits and monetary things from the property. Right now, both Brock and Alex should be getting half of the profits from the business. Because Brock paid Alex for half of the warehouse and business, it seems as though it is a 50/50 split. Brock could ask for a partition by sale so that the developer could buy the land and each of them would get half of the proceeds. Alex bought the land for $500,000 so it seems as though he'd be getting twice that in return plus there is nearby land that he could buy so that he wouldn't have to totally abandon his dream of having a brewery. However, courts do prefer partition in kind. They will look at whether or not is is possible to split up the land to give them equal value and whether or not it would be in the best interests of both Alex and Brock. Alex does have a personality interest in the property and he is significantly invested in the enterprise, both financially and emotionally. It may seem unfair to force him out of this just because Brock wants to sell to the developer. On the other hand, it may seem difficult to physically split the land because you can't literally split the warehouse, restaurant, and tasting room all in half. Brock can't even stand the smell of the brewery so he probably would not want that part of the land anyways, which likely holds the most value, making it nearly impossible to split up evenly. The court will likely find that a partition by sale is the best way to sever the tenancy in common because Alex and Brock would make a lot of money off of it and Alex could have the opportunity to move his business nearby. 1B. The issue is whether or not Carl has the right to possession ownership of the gold coins. If the coins were mislaid, meaning someone put them somewhere but forgot where, they belong to the original owner and then to owner of where they are found. (wallet in barbership case) Alex would likely argue that the coins were mislaid because they were in a mesh bag so they were intentionally wrapped up for safekeeping. Similar to the coins in airplane case, where the coins were wrapped up inside the airplane wing, the Bank got ownership because they owned the plane. If the court followed the idea of mislaid items, Carl would not get to keep the coins and Alex would. If the rightful owner came forward, Alex The issue is whether or not Carl has the right to possession ownership of the gold coins.

(wallet in barbership case) Alex would likely argue that the coins were mislaid because they were in a mesh bag so they were intentionally wrapped up for safekeeping. Similar to the coins in airplane case, where the coins were wrapped up inside the airplane wing, the Bank got ownership because they owned the plane. If the court followed the idea of mislaid items, Carl would not get to keep the coins and Alex would. If the rightful owner came forward, Alex would give them to the rightful owner. However, Carl may argue that the coins are treasure trove which means that unless they are discoverable by the true owner, the finder gets to keep them. If the coins are from the late 1800's, chances are the original owner is not coming back and wouldn't be able to find them so Carl would get to keep them. Some courts don't follow treasure trove at all though. Because they were wrapped up, Carl probably could not claim that they were lost or abandoned because there was clearly thought put into their placement. It is most likely that the court will see the coins as mislaid and Alex will be able to claim possession over them. Whether or not Carl has a claim against the brewery for losing/breaking the growler is another issue. For there to be a bailor/bailee relationship, the bailee must voluntary give possession (but not title) to the bailor. Similar to Allen v. Hyatt, where the car was parked in the garage and the owner took a ticket upon arrival, the bartender gave Carl a claim ticket so he could pick up his growler when it was ready. In Hyatt, the majority found that putting the car in the garage where there was an attendant and getting a ticket, a bailor/bailee relationship was established and the bailee could assume that Hyatt would take care of his car and make sure it was not stolen. The bartender acts similarly to the garage attendant in these facts. The dissent in Hyatt said that the bailee must have total possession and control over the property and even in this case, it seems as though they had total control because it was not like there were keys to go with the growler like there is for a car. The court will likely find that when Carl gave his growler to the bartender in exchange for the claim ticket, he voluntarily gave him possession which created a bailor/bailee relationship which means Carl could recover from the Bailor breaking his growler. Another issue is whether or not Carl has any legal rights as to his coat that he was unable to locate. The facts indicate that he voluntarily parted with it because he knew he had to get it on his way out which makes it not lost. He seemed to know where he had put it which means it was not mislaid. In the situation of going into a brewery and taking off your jacket, it is unlikely that it would be abandoned given the circumstances. Carl, may however, claim that the use of the coat rack was also a bailor/bailee relationship because he voluntarily gave possession of the jacket to an ammenity of the brewery. However, unlike the growler, there is no indication of a coat check where a person would give him a tag to pick up his coat upon exit. There doesn't seem to be an actual transfer of possession from Carl to facts indicate that he voluntarily parted with it because he knew he had to get it on his way out which makes it not lost. He seemed to know where he had put it which means it was not mislaid. In the situation of going into a brewery and taking off your jacket, it is unlikely that it would be abandoned given the circumstances. Carl, may however, claim that the use of the coat rack was also a bailor/bailee relationship because he voluntarily gave possession of the jacket to an ammenity of the brewery. However, unlike the growler, there is no indication of a coat check where a person would give him a tag to pick up his coat upon exit. There doesn't seem to be an actual transfer of possession from Carl to anyone. The brewery would likely say that the coat rack is a ""use at your own risk"" kind of deal. The Hyatt case suggested that if you park your car in an open lot with no gate/attendant/ticket machine/etc. then there is no bailor/bailee relationship. These facts follow similarly and it is unlikely that a court would find a bailor/bailee relationship where the bailor can be held accountable for the bailee's property. Carl would likely not be able to recover anything for the coat. 1C. Upon Alex's conveyance: David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation.

"," The issue is who has rightful ownership of Greenacre. As for Betty, tenants by the entirety cannot unilaterally sever the interest. To sever, there must be mutual agreement, death, or divorce. When Andrew gave Greenacre to Chris, he forged the deed and never even spoke to Betty about it because he didn't want to deal with her. Tenants by the entirety comes with a right of survivorship. When Andrew died, Betty took sole ownership of Greenacre. Betty will likely argue that because she did not agree to sell Greenacre, she owned it all once Andrew died. However, Debbie will likely claim adverse possession and possibly color of title. Color of title requries there to be a deed that the person got in good faith, but there is an issue with it. Debbie got Greenacre from Chris who got it from Andrew and nobody knew the original was forged. With color of title, the adverse possessor gets to claim the entire property. Because Betty was not somewhere else on the property, color of title probably wouldn't matter as much as for how much property she'd get. As for adverse possession, Debbie would need to satisfy that her use of the property is actual, open/notorious/ continuous, hostile, and exclusive and she must satisfy the statute of limitations. In New Suffolk, the SoL is 10 years. Chris was on the property from 2001 to 2009 and Debbie was on the property from 2009-2019. Chris and Debbie's time on the property could tack on to each other because they were in privity, meaning there was a voluntary transfer of property between them. The SoL is well satisfied. Chris was actually on the property for 8 weeks a year, which satisfies actual because the court would see that that is fishing season. He enlarged and insulated the cabin and the neighbors knew he was there so it was clearly open/notorious. Because the court looks at how the land could be used, being there during fishing season every year for 8 years must satisfy the statute of limitations. In New Suffolk, the SoL is 10 years.

Because the court looks at how the land could be used, being there during fishing season every year for 8 years satisfies continuity. Chris legitamately believed the land was his by deed so he satisfied hostile. Finally, he allowed people on the land but only with permission. Debbie is actually on the property as she is living there. It is open and notorious because she is not hiding her being there and neighbors know she is there so it is obvious. She built a year round house and is continuously there. In a state where hostility requires good faith, Debbie would satify this because she legitamately thinks the property is hers. In a state where bad faith is required, she would not satisfy it because she does not think there is another possible owner. However, most states do not care about the state of mind of the adverse possessor. Debbie is using the property exclusively. While the neighbors do hunt on the land, she gives them full permission to do so and would even need to give them further permission to do so on the 2 acres around her house. It is likely that, while Andrew and Betty did not properly sever the tenancy by the entirety, Debbie has satisfied all of the elements of adverse possession and the court would likely grant her ownership.

01759358-64dd-4801-b923-5a9914b62f19," Oliver's first child to retire has a contingent remainder in a life estate. Even though we know who oliver's children are, the remainder is contingent because this child must first satisfy the condition of being the first one of oliver's children to retire. It is a life estate because the grant specifically states ""for life."" Robert has a vested remainder in a life estate. It is vested because Robert is an ascertained person. Oliver's Grandchildren have a vested remainder in fee simple subject to open. It is a vested because one of Oliver's grandchilren has reached the condition, however, it is subject to open beacuse vivian is only 17 and when she turns 25 she will have an interest to the the remainder as well. Oliver may also have more grandchildren. O has a reversion in fee simple because he gave away more than he has and his reversion will not disappear until the open class closes The Rule against perpetuties states that and interest must vest or fail within a life in being at the time of the grant + 21 years. If not, that interest is void. The only interests that Rules against Perpetutites applies to are contingent remainders, vested reaminder subject to open, and executory interests. The interests that rules against perpetuities(RAP) would apply to is Olivers Children's contingent remainder, and the oliver's grandchildren who have a vested remainder subject to an open class. Robert's vested life estate does not apply here, therefore it is valid. Oliver's Children's interest is valid under RAP because because they are valid life in beings and you will know within their lifetime if their condition of retiring has been satisfied. However, Oliver's grandchildren's interest is void under RAP because there is a scenerio where their interest will not vest or fail within 21 years. Say if a year after the grant was made, another grandchild of oliver is born, Xavier. Everyone dies in an unfortunate car crash and there are no more valid life in beings. It will then take 25 years for that contingent remainder (that was open but now that everyone is dead we know who the grandchildren are) to vest, which is in violation of RAP. The grant should then strike the grandchilren's interest and leave his nephew robert with a vested remainder fee simple. "," Brock and Alex share a Tenancy in Common (TIC) in the Brewery, as Alex granted the land to himself and brock ""jointly as tenants in common."" Although one could argue that this conveyance created a joint tenancy because it used the word ""jointly,"" it takes extremely specific language to create a joint tenancy. It would have to say ""as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. As Tenants and common, each tenants have the right to convey, devise or transfer their undivided, fractioinal interest in the whole to another person without severing the TIC. Generally when arguments like the one between Alex and Brock occur, partitions of the property may be necessary. The two types of Partitions are partition and sale and partition in kind. Partion by sale is when the property is sold at market value and each tenant recieves their fractional share of the proceeds. A partition by kind is when the property is geographically split up and divided amonsgt the tenants. As articulated in Delfine v. Velencias, Courts favor Partition by kind because its is unfair to make someone pack up and leave their property, especially when they have a sentimental attachement to it. However, partitions by sale are more common because physically cutting the land in a way that everyone get an equal value is very difficult. A Partition by Sale is only granted when a party can prove that a partition by kind would be impractical AND that a partition by sale would be beneficial to both parties. In this scenerio, since brock wants to ""make money off of this developer,"" a partition by kind would not be of use here because Brock has no interest in keeping up with the long hours at the brewery. Additionally a partition by sale would also be unfair to alex because he has a sincere sentimental attachement to the brewery and making him pack up and leave would not be fair. Brock could argue that a partition by Sale would benefit both parties because not only will they be receiving far more than what the warehouse is worth, (bought at 500,000 and developer wants 2 million) meaning alex can build another brewery close by, it also would be impractical to to physically divide the land geographically, because only one party will be getting the warehouse, and both the developer and alex both have an interest in the warehouse. It would also be impossible to divide a warehouse and use part of it to build condos (which is what the developer wants to do) and continue running a brewery business. While Alex could argue that the TIC would allow him to convey his interest in the warehouse site to the developer because a Tenancy in common allow transfers without severing, Brock clearly has a stronger arugment in a partition by sale. The next issue is Carl's rights in regards to the gold coins he found in the brewery and if he can collect from the brewery for his lost coat and growler. interest in the warehouse. It would also be impossible to divide a warehouse and use part of it to build condos (which is what the developer wants to do) and continue running a brewery business. While Alex could argue that the TIC would allow him to convey his interest in the warehouse site to the developer because a Tenancy in common allow transfers without severing, Brock clearly has a stronger arugment in a partition by sale. The next issue is Carl's rights in regards to the gold coins he found in the brewery and if he can collect from the brewery for his lost coat and growler. The Gold Coins The traditional rule of founders law is that a person who finds a lost item has superior title to all other claims except the true owner and all other prior possessors/finders. (Armory v. Delamirie) The are general exceptions to this rule, such as mislaid, which was intentially placed somewhere by the owner and forgot about it. In this situation the property would belong first and foremost to the true owner and then to the property owner where the item was found (McAvoy). There is also a treasure trove category which few jursidictions follow (according to Benjamin v. linder aviations) which it will belong first and foremost to true owner if they are ever found, and then to the finder.Treasure troves usually are cold coins or plates. Carl could argue that the coins that he found were treasure troves, as when he got them appraised he discovered they were from the late 1800's. However, like in Corliss v. wenner, Jursidiction follow the treasure trove category and carl will likely not have a strong argument. Additionally, the coins were wrapped in a bag from a local grocery store that likey did not exist in the 1800's, therefore likely collapsing his treasure trove argument. Carl could then argue that they were lost because someone may have unitentionally dropped them and never came back for them. This argument is also pretty weak because, like in Benjamin v Linder aviations, the coins were carefully wrapped in a grocery bag and were hidden in a section of the warehouse, very unlikely that this is a lost item. Alex and Brock will likely argue that these items were mislaid and ttherefore belongs to them, the propery owners, because of the nature of which they were hidden and that it probably hasn't been hidden there too long because of the grocery bag and the fact that it was hidden in a crevice of the warehouse. Alex and Brock probably have the strongest argument and would probably gain possession of the coins if an action were brought, unless the the true owner of the coins ever came forward. The Growler and the coat. The issue here is whether there was a bailment relationship created between the brewery and carl when of the nature of which they were hidden and that it probably hasn't been hidden there too long because of the grocery bag and the fact that it was hidden in a crevice of the warehouse. Alex and Brock probably have the strongest argument and would probably gain possession of the coins if an action were brought, unless the the true owner of the coins ever came forward. The Growler and the coat. The issue here is whether there was a bailment relationship created between the brewery and carl when he handed in his growler and if there was bailement relationship when he hung up his coat. A bailment is a temporary transfer of possession that bailor entrust a baillee. Common examples of a Bailment relationship to be created is a vallet service or a coat check. For a bailement relationship to be created, the there must be a consensual, yet temporary, transfer in possesion of the item. Also, given the circumstances, it must be implied that the bailee's have a certain duty of care that and that item will be returned to them. (Allen v. Hyyat regency) Carl will likley be able to argue that there was a bailment relationship between the brewery staff and himself. Like in Hyatt regency, upon handing over possesion of the growler, carl recieved a claim ticket in which he would bring back later so the growler can be returned to him. The brewery may now owe carl for the damages to his growler because they violated the bailement relationship of care. The warehouse may argue that a bailment agreement was not made because the nature of a caotic brewery cannot promise that the growler would not be damaged. and that carl assumed the risk upon giving them his growler. however carl has a stronger argument because of the fact he recieved a claim ticket and the transfer was completely consensual As for the coat, carl will not be able to make the same argument because there was not a clear bailement when he hung up his coat in the open at a warehouse. 3) Alex gave David a fee simple subject to executory limitation and his children have an executory interest in fee simple. Alex does not have many rights in regards to this interest because this conveyance clearly violates the rules against perpetuties and therefore is invalid. This is because it the property could be used for other things other than residential purposes even a thousand years after all the valid life and beings have died. As for Edward, he was left with a fee simple subject to conditition subsequent and alex was left with a right of entry. Even though he the phrase ""so long as"" was used, the rules of construction favor condition subsuquent over a determinable because people would lose their land easier if the opposite violates the rules against perpetuties and therefore is invalid. This is because it the property could be used for other things other than residential purposes even a thousand years after all the valid life and beings have died. As for Edward, he was left with a fee simple subject to conditition subsequent and alex was left with a right of entry. Even though he the phrase ""so long as"" was used, the rules of construction favor condition subsuquent over a determinable because people would lose their land easier if the opposite was true because in a determinable, one does not need to take affirmative action to reclaim the land (marenholz). Alex will gave an interest only if he now takes affirmative action to retake the land from Edward. "," The issue here is whether Betty acquired Greenacre from betty through adverse possesion because the tenancy by entirety was not properly severed because there was no consent and the title to that land still technically belongs to betty. (The only way to break a tenancy by the entirety is through divorce, death, and mutual agreement) For someone to claim adverse possession, they must have been in possession of that land for the length of the statute of limitations and must meet all of the following criterial: actual, meaning being physically there, open and notorious, meaning putting the true owner on notice that they were using their land, exclusive, meaning they excluded strangers from their land, continuous, meaning that they were in continuous usage of the land, and hotile/ adverse, meaning they used the land without permission of the true owner. Statute of limitations: Betty could argue that debbie was only on the land for eight years, therefore not meeting the statute of limitations requirement of ten years. However, like in tieu v morgan, debbie will argue that she will be able to tack the time that chris was using the land because debbie and chris are in privity, meaning there was a consensual transfer of land between the two of them. therefore the SOL would of run out since it is 18 years. ( in this case SOL is 10) As long as chris can also meet the requirements for adverse possesion. Actual: debbie can argue that her activity on the land was actual because she was physically on the property. However, Betty may argue that the time period between 2009 and 2011 she was not in on the land so was a consensual transfer of land between the two of them. therefore the SOL would of run out since it is 18 years. ( in this case SOL is 10) As long as chris can also meet the requirements for adverse possesion. Actual: debbie can argue that her activity on the land was actual because she was physically on the property. However, Betty may argue that the time period between 2009 and 2011 she was not in on the land so that violates her actual usage of the land and was not there for the SOL period for ten years. Also, debbie was using the land in line with what a normal person would have used on the land. Open and Notorious: Debbie has a strong argument for open and notorious because her usage of the land was clearly open because she built a house on the land and betty, upon reasobale inspection/survery of her property, would have been put on notice that someone was using her land (marengo cave). While Betty may argue that she never goes to greenacre so she would have never known, Debbies argument is clearly stronger. Continuous: Betty will argue that from the time period between 2009, when she was conveyed the land, and 2011 when she built her year round house, that her presence on the land was not continous. especially in the land where she did not go because she was not very outdoorsy. Debbie can will then argue her usage was continuous because chris and her, assuming their privity argument was accepted, was in continuous usage that makes up for the two missing years. Exclusive: Debbie's usage was clearly exclusive because she lived in that house alone and did not allow her friends to hunt around the two acres surrounding her house. Betty will argue that her usage wasnt exlusive due to her allowing her friends to hunt around the land ""whenever they wish"" Adverse/hostile: Debbie was clearly not acting with permission and I believe that betty would have a hard time trying to argue with this category of AP. If action were brought by betty to remove debbie from the land, i believe that debbie would only be entitled to the two acres of land her house resides on and thats it. The rest of the land, betty has a strong claim for because debbie did not use that portion of the land in align with adverse possession. Adverse/hostile: Debbie was clearly not acting with permission and I believe that betty would have a hard time trying to argue with this category of AP. If action were brought by betty to remove debbie from the land, i believe that debbie would only be entitled to the two acres of land her house resides on and thats it. The rest of the land, betty has a strong claim for because debbie did not use that portion of the land in align with adverse possession. Adverse possession for Chris for the privity argument: I think it is important to point out that chris must also meet the adverse possession requirements in order for debbie to tack on the time between the two. Although chris occupied the cabin he built only eight weeks out of the year, this will still count as continuous because of the fact that it was a seasonal exception in that he went primarily during the fishing season. It can be argued that his usage was exclusive because even though others were using his cabin, they were doing so with his permission and excluded them while he was actually in the cabin. He also was not using the land with anyones permission therefore it was hostile. He also was physically there and actually used it so it was actual. Lastly, it was open and notorious due to the same reasoning as debbie's, betty could have and should have done a reasonable inspection of the land and she would have been on notice that someone was using her land.

75ac3a93-a64f-47f9-84e0-7dd6586f52f0," First, all future interests and present estates will be considered before application of the common law Rule against Perpetuities, later abbreviated as RAP. Oliver granted contingent remainders in a life estate to his children, Connor and Carla (Connor and Carla are born, ascertainable, and must meet the condition of retiring). Robert then has a vested remainder in life estate (he need not meet any conditions and is ascertainable and born- he will wait patiently for Connor and Carla's death). Oliver's grandchild, Victor, has a vested remainder subject to open (open because he is in an open class, as more grandchildren could be born). Vivian has a contingent remainder as she is born, ascertained, and must meet the requirement of reaching age 25. RAP aims to limit dead hand control, in this case, we want Oliver to not have too much control over what happens way in the future, when society changes and circumstances may change. Under RAP, no interest is good unless it vests, if at all, no later than 21 years after the death of a life in being at the creation of the grant. It applies to executory interests, vested remainders subject to open, and contingent remainders. 21 years after the death of a measuring life all classes must close. A life in being will be used as a validating life. Any life in being at the time of the creation can be the measuring life to see if the interest must vest or forever fail to vest no later than 21 years after the end of that life in being. If one (conveyed) interest is invalid, then all are invalid (one ruins all doctrine). Here, we will test Carla and Connor's life first as validating lives. Looking into a crystal ball, Oliver could die the day after conveyance. Then, Carla and Connor could die one day later. Then, Robert could die. At this point, under the Rule of Convenience, Victor is lucky enough to be alive and met the condition of being 25, so he is entitled to take the property. This conveyance is valid under RAP for the Rule of Convenience. Looking again into a crystal ball, Oliver could die the day after conveyance. Connor could have a child, X, Oliver's grandchild, and then Connor could die the next day. Then, the next day, Carla dies. So, now, Robert can exercise a present possessory interest in his life estate. However, unfortunately Robert dies in a car accident with Vivian and Victor. X will not turn 25 years old 21 years after the death of a being 25, so he is entitled to take the property. This conveyance is valid under RAP for the Rule of Convenience. Looking again into a crystal ball, Oliver could die the day after conveyance. Connor could have a child, X, Oliver's grandchild, and then Connor could die the next day. Then, the next day, Carla dies. So, now, Robert can exercise a present possessory interest in his life estate. However, unfortunately Robert dies in a car accident with Vivian and Victor. X will not turn 25 years old 21 years after the death of a life in being, given that Victor, who already met the requirement of being 25, cannot come back to life. The conveyance is invalid under common law RAP, but may be saved by the rule of convenience explained above. Rewritten: Oliver Owner grants his property ""to the first of my children to retire for life."" O's children have contingent remainders and O retains a reversion. 2) "," 1a. The issue is what property interest Brock has in the brewery after his brother signed a deed inviting him to the business and whether he can make money from the developer interested in the property. In 2003, Brock and his brother Alex entered into a tenancy in common, a type of co-ownership. It is clear from the language that it is a tenancy in common because of the phrase ""in common"" and although the word ""jointly"" is used, which may indicate a joint tenancy (with right of survivorship), or JTWROS, in order to create a JTWROS the language must usually be very explicit, most courts requiring a ""with right of survivorship"" or ""and not tenants in common"" language; courts also prefer tenancies in common when language is ambiguous. As a tenant in common, Brock can devise and convey his interest to the developer without approval from his brother, Alex. As a first possibility, since Alex seems to have become detached to the brewery, he could sell his interest to the developer. As a second option, he could request rent from Alex. He has this option bgecause Brock had been ousted when Alex yelled ""...Now get out of here and don't come back!"" Alex ousted him because Brock was denied permission to re-enter the property. As tenants in common, the tenants must have access to the property of interest. As a third option, Brock could take drastic measures (which he may want to do, as it seems as though his relationship with Alex has gone downhill) and go to court to request either a partition in sale or partition of kind. Partition in kind, though preferred by courts, seems unlikely to occur in this situation. Partition in kinds will be disfavored when the property is physically impossible or physically impracticable to be partitioned, or when the this option bgecause Brock had been ousted when Alex yelled ""...Now get out of here and don't come back!"" Alex ousted him because Brock was denied permission to re-enter the property. As tenants in common, the tenants must have access to the property of interest. As a third option, Brock could take drastic measures (which he may want to do, as it seems as though his relationship with Alex has gone downhill) and go to court to request either a partition in sale or partition of kind. Partition in kind, though preferred by courts, seems unlikely to occur in this situation. Partition in kinds will be disfavored when the property is physically impossible or physically impracticable to be partitioned, or when the interests of the parties would be better suited for partition of sale. The warehouse is ten acres, so although mathematically it may be easy to split (according to each Alex and Brock's interest), the physical structure is a warehouse (not easy to partition physically)! As for the parties interest, Alex has become laboriously and emotionally attached to the property. Though economic factors will be considered, they are not dispositive. In the case studied where a woman had a trash business, the court not only looked at the economic factors but that the woman (and previous generations) had become attached to the property, in a sense their personhood would be compromised had a partition of sale had occurred). Partitions in sales must be justified in a strong sense because to make people give up their property, against their will, is something against property rights and values. Here, Alex's personhood would be compromised. His labor, love, and commitment toward the business shows this. 1b. The issue is whether Carl has any property rights in the coins he discovered at the base of the warehouse wall and whether he has an interest, too in the growler he could not claim and the coat he could not find. Carl would be considered a finder. Usually, a finder has a title to the property found against all others but the true owner (Armory v. Delamirie). There are different categories of found chattel, and the coins could fit in multiple. The coins could be considered treasure trove, though this category has been rejected by some courts and in Idaho has been rejected and replaced with ""embedded"" property category, which belongs to the owner of the premises in which it is found. The hole could have been made by someone wishing to hide the coins. Treasure trove categorizes coins or other valuable items, usually very old, such that the true owner is probably dead or can not be tracked down. Here, this does not seem to be the case, as the mesh bag had the name of a grocery store which has only been opened for ten years. We must consider the fact that it is unlikely for someone to place coins in a hole, and then come back with a new bag to replace whatever was containing the coins before after a new grocery store opens. It is most likely not lost either; lost property is involuntarily parted and it is physically impractible to, while in the process of losing an item, have the property find itself in a small hole where made by someone wishing to hide the coins. Treasure trove categorizes coins or other valuable items, usually very old, such that the true owner is probably dead or can not be tracked down. Here, this does not seem to be the case, as the mesh bag had the name of a grocery store which has only been opened for ten years. We must consider the fact that it is unlikely for someone to place coins in a hole, and then come back with a new bag to replace whatever was containing the coins before after a new grocery store opens. It is most likely not lost either; lost property is involuntarily parted and it is physically impractible to, while in the process of losing an item, have the property find itself in a small hole where the property can only be taken by squeezing a finger down the hole. The coins could be considered embedded, as items are under a surface. In this case, the embedded property goes to the owner of the premises because a person could reasonably be entitled to embedded items found on his or her property. Here, it seems the mesh bag was physically connected to a wall at the base of the warehouse- the warehouse could argue it is their property. However, to counter argue that point, the warehouse was built in 2000 and Alex/Brock probably did not embed the coins. We must consider the compelling fact that whoever placed the coins there knew the relative value, or that the coins were at least valuable in some respect. There could be an argument made that the coins were mislaid; they were voluntarily set down and then overlooked. If there was no physically marker near the base of the warehouse, the person who put the coins down may have forgotten where they placed them. Overall, it seems that the Alex and Brock have ownership of the coins since the coins were embedded in/under the wall of the premises in which they own. Carl could craftly make an argument that the coins are his because the coins were abandoned (finder has title to abandoned chattel against all including the true owner) because they were acquired by someone with a perhaps criminal intent, maybe a late 1800s war criminal where a disloyal member of the militia was afraid of being caught by lietenants. As with regards to his coat, Carl seems to have gave up his title when he gives up looking and leaves the brewery. Perhaps this was the wrong choice because he seems to have abandoned it. Though abandoned property is usually voluntary relinquished, and so the opposing side (probably thief) would have a better claim if Carl voluntarily placed his coat and then didn't want it when he left and went home, it still seems abandoned in the way that Carl realized his coat was not there, and walked away. Carl could make the considerably strong argument though, that the coat is mislaid, since he voluntarily set it down and then overlooked where he put it. In this case, it is property of the brewery's, as mislaid items go to the premises in which they are found (the rationale behind this is that when people mislay items, they are likely to retrace their steps). It is also possible Carl came with no coat, but that he usually does wear a coat and so forgot that he came to the brewery without one; this is far-fetched, but Carl was eager to get his growler and was upset when he left. Next, with regards to his growler, it seems unfortunately that Carl's growler was shattered by an down and then overlooked where he put it. In this case, it is property of the brewery's, as mislaid items go to the premises in which they are found (the rationale behind this is that when people mislay items, they are likely to retrace their steps). It is also possible Carl came with no coat, but that he usually does wear a coat and so forgot that he came to the brewery without one; this is far-fetched, but Carl was eager to get his growler and was upset when he left. Next, with regards to his growler, it seems unfortunately that Carl's growler was shattered by an employee. Here, we must consider whether a bailment was created when Carl gave his growler to the bartender (to be filled with beer) and the bartender gave Carl a claim ticket. A bailment occurs when the owner of property, the bailor, gives the bailee, the possessor, a piece of property so that the bailee has some duty of care while possessing the piece of property (Allen v. Hyatt). Factors must be considered to determine whether the bailee has a duty of care. Carl, being the bailor, gave the bartender possession of his growler and in turn the bartender gave Carl a ticket which identified the growler to which it was associated with. According to Allen v. Hyatt, factors to consider whether a bailment has occured include: identification (property identified so that the bailee may match) and security given while in the care of bailee personnel. Here, the bailee personnel are the bartenders responsible for filling the growler. The bartender had a reasonable duty of care that the growler was not broken. Carl had a reasonable belief that his growler could be recovered in nearly the same condition it was given (and filled with beer). Even under the strict standards of the dissent in Allen, where a bailment can only happen when a bailor voluntarily makes a delivery of such items and the bailee assumes a duty of care (dissent contended no delivery of Mr. Allens car had been made), this situation would satisfy the requirements of delivery and assumption of care by implied duty of care. When Carl asked for the claim ticket, and it was then given, this implies the bartender who gave the claim ticket had communicated to Carl that he would take care of the growler. The bartender will have the burden of proof that they are not negligent. They will most likely fail on this part, and be liable to Carl in damages for the sentimental growler. 1c. The issue is what interests were created when Alex decided to write his deed conveying half his property to David and the other half to Alex. David First, Alex conveyed to David a fee simple subject to executory limitation and Frank and Fred executory interests (in fee simple) that will vest as soon as, or if whenever David uses the property for anything other than residential uses. As soon as David builds his develoopment that is allowing commercial stores to open, Frank and Fred automatically have ownership in the property. However, since David ""has decided,"" he may decide differently and change his mind. Mere thoughts, musings, David First, Alex conveyed to David a fee simple subject to executory limitation and Frank and Fred executory interests (in fee simple) that will vest as soon as, or if whenever David uses the property for anything other than residential uses. As soon as David builds his develoopment that is allowing commercial stores to open, Frank and Fred automatically have ownership in the property. However, since David ""has decided,"" he may decide differently and change his mind. Mere thoughts, musings, and plans do not mean anything. David must actually use the property for non-residential purposes for Frank and Fred to cut short David's interest. Edward Second, Alex's deed to Edward has ambiguous language. The words ""so long as"" are considered words of duration and are usually associated with fee simples determinable with the grantor retaining a possibility of reverter, where no action is needed to re-claim possession if the condition is broken. However, the phrase ""re-enter"" is associated with a grantor's interest when a fee simple subject to condition subsequent is granted. Since courts prefer fee simples subject to conditions subsequent, that is what the court will most likely qualify Edward's interest as. Having such, Alex will retain a power of re-entry, in which he must take action to re-claim the property if Edward starts making IPAs on the premises. As soon as Edward makes IPAs on the property, Alex will need to make some affirmative action (trespass order or going to court) to re-claim his title. Again, Edward has merely decided this. Until he actually started making IPA's, Alex's affirmative actions will not prove successful, because mere planning is not actual use. 3) "," The issue is whether Betty or Debbie have property interests in Greenacre. I. Debbie The issue relating to Debbie is whether she can claim adverse possession over Greenacre. In order to adversely possess a property, the statutory time period must pass and the use must be: actual, open and notorious, hostile, continuous, and exclusive. Any element that is defeated defeats the adverse possessor's whole claim. Actual: the adverse possessor physically enters and uses the land and the use of the property is I. Debbie The issue relating to Debbie is whether she can claim adverse possession over Greenacre. In order to adversely possess a property, the statutory time period must pass and the use must be: actual, open and notorious, hostile, continuous, and exclusive. Any element that is defeated defeats the adverse possessor's whole claim. Actual: the adverse possessor physically enters and uses the land and the use of the property is comparable to how another person would use such property, given the circumstances. First, evaluating Chris's use (because a court could tack his and Debbie's time, described below under hostility element), it seems that his use was reasonable given the property's rural circumstances. Many people enjoy rural, scenic, and natural areas as recreational areas part time out of the year, and the fact that he made a cabin to sleep in is akin to using the property as a second home. Debbie has an even stronger claim to actual use, as she built a year-round house in which she sleeps, eats, and maintains (garden). Betty could argue that the use is not actual, because Chris was only there for eight weeks out of the year and only during fishing season. Betty could argue that Debbie did not meet the requirement because the average owner would use all of the 50 acres; this is not a strong argument, given the rural nature of the property and the fact that it is reasonable for Debbie to not be interested in the outdoors (some people are not!). Open and Notorious: use that puts the owner on notice, either actual or constructive, that her property is being used. The true owner need not know that the property is being used, but just that the use would put a patrolling owner on notice if the owner monitors the property. The use must be ""visible"" (Marengo Cave v. Ross). Betty, the wife, slept on her rights as owner of Greenacre. Had she patrolled her property, she would know that it was being used. However, she could argue that she had an implied agreement with her husband that he would patrol the area. Logically following this, then, Betty should have started patrolling the area in 2004 when her husband died. Hostile: the use is against the true owner's interests. At minimum, the adverse possessor does not admit anyone else has a superior claim(Cahill v. Morrow). Previous adverse possessors time of use of the property may be ""tacked own"" to the current adverse possessor (Tieu v. Morgan). The prevailing idea is that intent of mind is irrelevant. Though, some states like Maine require the adverse possessor to know it is not her property, and some states like Oregon require the adverse possessor to be acting in good faith (the adverse possessor truly thinks that is her property). Here, Debbie fits both the prevailing Chris had no reason to know the signature of point of view and Oregon's good faith standard, since Andrew's wife was forged, and therefore when he passed it to his daughter Debbie, she would not know, either. Something that may be to Debbie's advantage is that under color of title, her hostiliy property may be ""tacked own"" to the current adverse possessor (Tieu v. Morgan). The prevailing idea is that intent of mind is irrelevant. Though, some states like Maine require the adverse possessor to know it is not her property, and some states like Oregon require the adverse possessor to be acting in good faith (the adverse possessor truly thinks that is her property). Here, Debbie fits both the prevailing point of view and Oregon's good faith standard, since Chris had no reason to know the signature of Andrew's wife was forged, and therefore when he passed it to his daughter Debbie, she would not know, either. Something that may be to Debbie's advantage is that under color of title, her hostiliy element is more likely to be satisfied because the deef Andrew gave Chris had a forged signature (color of title documents have forged signatures or incorrect property dimensions). Exclusive: the true owner is ousted. Essentially, the adverse possessor uses the property as her own. Inviting people over does not defeat the exclusivity requirement, so, here, the neighbors were allowed to enjoy the property at Debbie's (and Chris's) invitation. Betty could argue that since Debbie lets her neighbors use the land ""whenever they wish,"" this defeats the exclusive element because Debbie does not exclusively use the property, as she lets her neighbors have free reign of all the acres except her physically house + the 2 acres surrounding her house. Statutory period: depending on the jursidiction, it may be 5-30 years. Tacking Debbie's use of time onto Chris's, her father's, the use is from 2001-2019 (present), or, 18 years. Any statutory period less than 18 years followed by the court will invalidate Debbie's whole claim. Policy considerations: the court may consider Chris as an innocent victim in this situation. Being a ""college buddy"" of Andrew's means that they've built some trust based on their prior friendship; Chris would have no reason to believe his friend would forge his wife's signature. Chris really believed he had the property, and his wish was to give the property to his daughter. Moreover, Betty rarely thought about Greenacre. In fact, she thought about it so rarely that she did not remember it until she went through her records in 2019 (15 years after her husband's death) and realized she had never even been there! Debbie has attached herself to her property. A person's dignity is attached to their property and the State must have a very compelling reason to take it away. Debbie has lived there year-round for eight years and Betty has little to no connection to the property, having never been there (Betty could argue that it reminds her of her dead husband, and wants to reclaim it because of that, though her relationship with him was borderline hostile). Conclusion: Debbie has the stronger arguments for adverse possession, and will probably be given all title to the property so long as the statutory period has been might. The policy considerations may be so strong in this situation that the court may adopt a lenient statutory period, like 7-8 years, so that years and Betty has little to no connection to the property, having never been there (Betty could argue that it reminds her of her dead husband, and wants to reclaim it because of that, though her relationship with him was borderline hostile). Conclusion: Debbie has the stronger arguments for adverse possession, and will probably be given all title to the property so long as the statutory period has been might. The policy considerations may be so strong in this situation that the court may adopt a lenient statutory period, like 7-8 years, so that Debbie may retain the property. II. Andrew and Betty Andrew and Betty had Greenacre as tenants by the entirety, which has all of the elements of a JTWROS plus marriage (though some states allow domestic partnerships instead of marriage). Andrew severed the four unities when he sold the land to Chris. This would make Betty and Chris tenants in common. When Chris died, Betty and Debbie were tenants in common. However, Betty seems to no longer have any property rights because of Debbie's strong claim of adverse possession detailed above. It is important to note that some jurisdictions necessitate someone like Andrew to make such severances known to the records department of a town so as to avoid bad-faith actors. III. Resolving I and II If the court finds Betty and Debbie tenants in common, and Debbie tells Betty to get off her property, Betty may go to court and receive rent compensation due to ouster. See previous answers for ouster definition. The court may also order a partition of sale or partition in kind. It may be easier and more favorable to do a partition in kind since it is physically practical in this situation... Out of Time Outline: - PIK: favorable. Let Debbie keep her house. 25 acres each. -PIS: unfavorable. Persoonhood theory related to Debbie. ",589,2273,1439

This interest also allows Oliver to retain possession in the event that neither of his children retire. Both of Oliver's children (Connor and Carla) possess an executory interest (springing) in a life estate, such that the first to retire will take possession. Robert's future interest is a contingent remainder in a life estate. Given Victor's age, he has a future interest in a vested reaminder in fee simple subject to partial/open. Until Vivian reaches age 25, her interest is a contingent remainder in fee simple. RAP analysis yields no violations given the unambigous life status of the beneficiaries. Oliver's children are known upon Oliver's death. Further, were neither Connor nor Carla alive, Robert is alive.

Brock: Steps to ""make some money from this developer"". ""> <![CDATA[ The first issue is to determine whether Alex and Brock are operating the brewery as joint tenants or as tenants in common, as the language used by Alex is ambiguous (""jointly as tenants in common""). In order for a joint tenancy to be property formed, the parties in tenancy must have satisfied the four unities (time, title, interest, and possession). In order to execute the four unities, a strawman (3rd party) is used whereby an original owner conveys the property to a strawman, and the property is subsequently conveyed back to the joint tentants. This strategy allows the tenants to acquire their interests at the same time and on the same document (title). Each owns the property undivided; their possession affords each the ability to use is it fully, exclude others and generate income. In analyzing whether Alex and Brock created joint tenancy, it is apparent that they did not satisfy the four unities. That is, Alex and Brock did acquire ownership of the brewery at the same time (via strawman); therefore, their interest must be ruled as a ""tenants in common"". As tentants in common, each has an interest in a fractional share of the business (50/50), including additional property rights: right to undivided use, right to exclude, right to generate income, right to alienate (assuming no provisions preventing otherwise). Overall, based on the deed signed by Alex and regardless of the intent to the parties, the court would likley determine Alex & Brock's interest as ""tenants in common"". The next issue concerns whether Brock has any options with respect to effecting of the property to the real estate developer. When determining the manor in which real estate should be sold in the event of a disagreement among tenants in common, the court will determine whether a sale should be a partition sale or sale in kind. A partition sale is a sale of the entire property with the proceeds divided according to ownership interest. A partition in kind allows for the sale of an a tenant's individual portion of the property while allowing other tenants to keep their interest. In the case of Alex and Brock; it is likely the court would settle on a partition by sale. Alex may argue for a partition in kind; however, given the nature of the property it would not make a lot of sense. The court would have a difficult time determining the valuation a relatively new business- further the goal of the real estate developer is to convert the poperty into housing, which means their would be no market function for guaging value. Additionally, if Alex were to make an emotional appeal to the court, it would other tenants to keep their interest.

Additionally, if Alex were to make an emotional appeal to the court, it would likely fall flat, given the lack of history (only 4 years) and the fact that no one is actually stopping him from performing his livelihood (Hickeringill)); he can simply move his operation nearby. Further, Brock has a strong argument for executing the sale from the standpoint that the property and their capital may be put to better use through effecting the sale. He is after all, entitled to income generated by the property. The sale of the land appears to be more lucrative the operating the brewery. If Brock were to purse legal action to effect the sale, the court would likely grant a partition by sale. <QUESTION id='Q1' tell=""Question 1B. ""> <![CDATA[ The first issue is whether Carl, who found a bag of gold coins in the wall of the brewery has a claim of ownership on the basis of finders law. Finders law is generally governed by the folowing types of found property and associated rights: Finders Law Abandoned Property: original owner gives up rights Lost Property: original owner retains right; if not claimed then to finder Mislaid Property: original owner retains right; if not claimed then to owner on which the property was found Treasure trove: original owner retains right; if not claimed then to finder To determine the status of Carl's interest in the coins, the nature of their finding needs to be analyzed according the the finders law outlined above. It is unlikely that the coins have been abandoned; they appear to have been strategically place implying no intent to simply give up on the right of ownership. For the same reason, it can be implied that the coins have not been lost. Further, while the coins may qualify as treasure (given the fact that they are actually coins), I'm going to assume Bostonia does not recgonize treasure trove in determining finders interests in order to avoid incentivizing trespass and further alienability from the original owner. Therefore, using a similar reasoning as the court in Corliss, the property will likely be classified as mislaid. Since the property was found inside the wall; conceivably where people inside the brewery were not accustomed access despite it being a relatively appear to have been strategically place implying no intent to simply give up on the right of ownership.

Therefore, using a similar reasoning as the court in Corliss, the property will likely be classified as mislaid. Since the property was found inside the wall; conceivably where people inside the brewery were not accustomed access despite it being a relatively public place, the ownership interest is granted to the property owner. This may have fallen in a different direction had the property been found out in the open, in which case, Carl would have a legitimate claim over the coins. One further point; I have assumed the grocery store's name on the coins is not indcative of ownership. Overall, the court will likely grant Alex & Black (property owners) a claim over the coins give the manor in which they were found (in a wall) and classified as such as mislaid property. The next issue Carl needs to address is whether he has any legal rights with respect to his growler and coat. A bailment is created when the there exists a presumption of negligence on the part of the bailee for not returning property to the bailor. In this case, the brewery appears to offer the service supplying beer to customers in the customer's own growlers. Carl was provided a claim ticket; he gave up his growler temporarily; presumably paid a fee; and expected his growler in return full of beer. Assuming Carl's growler is destroyed on the basis of evidence cited by the brewery employee sweeping up glass and it's inability to be located, Carl likely has a claim of negligence citing the fact that a bailment was created. As for Carl's coat, no such bailment existed. It appears that hooks were made available for customers to use; however this does not create the same type of presumption of duty that one obtains when receiving a ticket in temporarily giving up control over their property. Carl was in effect, using the coat hooks at his own risk. Overall, the court will likley find that Carl has a claim against the brewery for the destructing of the growler given that a bailment existed; he not does not have the same claim for his coat. Question IC. The issues to determine consist of the present and future interests in effect by virtue of Alex subdiving and selling the property.

In the sale of the vacant 5 acres to David; David owns a fee simple subject to executive limitation. That is, if if the property is ever used for non-residential uses, his ownership will be cut short. In that event, Frank and Fred (Alex's sons) will acquire interest via executory interest (shifiting). Alex has nothing. In the sale of the other 5 acres (the brewery), Edward has a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. His interest may be cut short give the stipulation that ""if IPA's are ever made on the premises, Alex has th eright to re-enter and reclaim the premises"". Edward has since violated this provision by making IPA's. Alex's interest is a Right of Entry in fee simple. He will need to take affirmative action in order to reclaim the brewery.

Brock, I understand you want to know if you are able to sell your property you share with your brother and reap a profit. The deed Alex signed in 2003 saying ""jointly as tenants in common"" did not clearly indicate that you two were to be joint tenants with a right of survivorship. Since the deed does not clearly state this, then the deed is automatically assumed to have created a tenants in common realtionship. You paid Alex half of the money for the business and half of the money for the warehouse site so it seems you own one half of the property. However, it is also important to look at the intentions of Alex when he signed the deed. It appears that he 6 always had a passion for his business and has wanted to include you in his activites to help grow the brewery. He cares a lot about it, paid $500,000 for it, and the court might find him to have a more compelling interest to the property and therefore hold indicate that you two were to be joint tenants with a right of survivorship.

Regardless, once your portion of the business is defined you are able to only sell your portion of the business to the developer. You could also ask for a partition in kind in which your portion of the property would be evenly divided, or a partition by sale in which each of your portions would be appriased and you can sell your portion while Alex can keep his. A partition by sale would make more sense because it deosnt make sense for the busienss to physically be divided in two. Overall, you will be able to sell your portion of the business to the developer. 1b. Dear Carl, I understand you would like to know if you are able to keep the gold coins because you found them at the Brewery. We must first define what kind of property they coins are considered to be. Since you found them in the wall carefully placed and carefully wrapped, they do not appear to be abandonded or lost in any way because of the care and pricision that went into placing them where they are. The coins would not be considered mislaid property, propery left behind by the original owner, because the original owner would have had to purposly put them there and forgot to take them back. It seems unlikely that someone would go through such thought to hide something and simply forget to take it with them. The coins could also potentially be considered treasure trove property, in which case the finder of such coins would be able to keep them, however this doctrine is not practiced in the U.S. Therefore, the only type of property left is embedded property. If the coins are considered embetted property they belong to Alex and Brock, the owners of the Brewery and Warehouse. When valuable or historical items are found on a property they are usually treated as if they are embetted property. This means that they belong to the owner of the property because they are considered the same as the soil which the property stands on. (Carliss v. Wenner) Similar to this case, Carliss found coins on Wenners property and the courts decided Wenner had the superior claim to the coins. The coins in your case did come out of the wall of the warehouse and not the soil, and the warehouse walls existed far before Alex Therefore, the only type of property left is embedded property. If the coins are considered embetted property they belong to Alex and Brock, the owners of the Brewery and Warehouse. When valuable or historical items are found on a property they are usually treated as if they are embetted property. This means that they belong to the owner of the property because they are considered the same as the soil which the property stands on. (Carliss v. Wenner) Similar to this case, Carliss found coins on Wenners property and the courts decided Wenner had the superior claim to the coins. The coins in your case did come out of the wall of the warehouse and not the soil, and the warehouse walls existed far before Alex purchased it. However, it is still likely that the coins will be considered embedded property and you will not be able to keep them. I also understand you would like to know if there is anything you can do legally to about your growler and coat. Looking at the types of property defined above, we can define your missing posessions in a couple of ways. Your growler was lost by the people who you entrusted with it. Since the brewery was in posession and control of it when it went missing, therefore creating a bailment relationship like the one in Holiday Inn Nashville. In that case a man left his car in the care of a parking garage when he came back from it it was stolen. The garage was found to have a bailment relationship with the man because they had security, tickets for entry, and a person at the exit of the garage. In this case you gave the growler to the employee and entrusted them with directly caring for it while they posessed it, similar to dropping your clothes off at the dry cleaners. Therefore, you would likely be able to recover damages from them to account for the loss and/or discruction of it. Your missing coat is another issue. Since you decided to leave without it, a competing interest could calim it is abandoned property. You knew it was there and still decided to leave without retrieving it. If a court finds this to be true then the person who has your coat has the superior claim. Technically you did not leave it there and forget it, but in the case that your coat is found there, the owners of the brewery will had posession of it until you return for it. You can go back and look for it, and if it is lost then your property will be considered lost property. If you find it elsewhere in the hands of a new posessor, you will have a suprior claim to the coat if you can prove it was yours. I hope this was helpful and I hope to hear from you soon. From, Attorney From, Attorney 3) 1c. Alex, When you sold your land, you conveyed the following interests: David has a fee simple determinable, and your two sons have a possibility of a reverter in fee simple. David was able to purchase the land as long as he used it for residential purposes only. He plans on putting in commecial stores which violates this interest. If he is to follow through with this, his interest will no longer be his, but it will immeditely revert to your sons in fee simple absolute. Since this interest is determinable, your sons do not have to take any action, the property will go right to them. David might try to claim that he has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in which case he would claim your sons would have to take action against him. It is unlikely a court would find this to be true because your language indicated duration which defines the right to the property as determinable. You also conveyed the other portion of your property in the following way: You could argue the same thing that Edward and his heirs have a a fee simple determinable because you used the language ""as long as."" In this case if they start to brew IPAs you would have a possibility of a reverter which allows you to autematically re-enter and reclaim the premises as the contract states. "," Andrew and Betty owned Greenacre as Tenants by the Entirety. This means they had equal ownership of it and one is not permitted to make any decisions about the property without the others consent. When Andrew sold the property to his friend Chris he was violating this creating a defective title. However, when Chris bought the property he trusted that the title was accurate, he was a good faith purchaser and therefore his claim to the land is valid under Color of Title, unlike the purchaser in the case with Sitton and the Jewler. Chris then lived on the land for 8 years before giving it to his Daughter, Debbie, who continued to live there. For that amount of time, her posession was open, notorious and continuous because she lived there openly for years doing various activities and building a house, it was hostile because she claimed to have the rightful ownership, it was exclusive because she was the only one inhabiting it and it was actual because she lived there and used the land for the entirely of those years. Since Chris and Debbie are in privity Debbie is able to tack on the time Chris spent there in order to claim an adverse posession claim under color of title as well. The deed stated the land was 50 acres, and even though she only used those acres if you obtain a defective title under color of title and only adversely posess some of the land you still own the entirety of the land. Although Debbie was a Tenant by the Entirety, Debbie still adversely posessed the land because she lived there for 10 years on her own and her father lived there for an additional 8 years satisfying the statute of limitations for adverse posession.

The grant to Oliver's grandchildren is also subject to the RAP becuase it includes a ""sibject to partial divestment"" clause for Victor and an executory interest in the rest of the grandchildren. Unfortunately for Victor, if it is possible for an interest to vest more than 21 years after the death of all the validating lives (Oliver and Robert) then the entire clause is void.

"," 1A) The issue here, is whether or not Brock is able to get what he wants (out of the brewery buisness and money) without his brother's permission. Brock's interest in the property in question is partial and he is a tenant in common with his brother so he does have options. Tenants in common are able to petition the court for a partition in sale as well as a partition in kind. Brock has the option to go behind his brother's back, petition the court to rule in favor a partition in sale, and then contact the developer to get the sale price he is looking for.

Unfortunately for Brock, when tenants in common petition for a partition, the default is a partition in kind which is what the court ruled in Delfino v. Valencia. In Delfino, the plaintiff wanted a partition by sale becuase they did not want to be associated with their tenant in common's trash buisness but the court ruled in favor of a parition in kind (breaking up the property) to keeps things fair for Valencia who had established their trash buisness on the property. In Delfino, the court said that they default to partition in kind whenever possible. Although the facts are a little different, the court generally looks for an equitable remedy to tenant in common disputes, and in this case would conisder all the hard work Alex put into creating this buisness and considering that they favor a partition in kind, would rule in favor of the partition in kind. That being said, Brock could be able to argue that since the developer is offering more than the property is worth and with the proceeds, Alex could purchase another property with a remainder in cash that it would be most equitable for the brothers to sell and for Alex to re-establish his brewery at a different location. 1B) Dear Carl, The issue at stake regarding the gold coins is the manner in which you found them. The way you discovered the coins sounds like they are mislaid property (someobody put them their expecting to come back for them) since you found them in a wall. The rule regarding mislaid property is that the owner of the property on which the item was found has an exclusive right over all except the original owner (McAvoy v. Medina). This means that Alex and Brock would be entitled to the coins becuase you found them on their property. Even if you wanted to argue that these coins are not mislaid because they are so old that the original owner is no longer around, the court would still rule in favor of Alex and Brock by invoking the imbedded property rule which states that lost property which is imbedded on a piece of property goes to the owner of the property on which the lost property is embedded (Corhill v. Wenner). This rule was established with an equitable state of mind; if someone buys a piece of property, they have a reasonable understanding that they own everything on and in the property. Given the two established rules listed here, I believe that you should return the gold coins to Alex and Brock. Regarding your growler you may be in luck. Although it sounds like you got frustrated an abandoned your growler after hearing that it may have been broken, you do have an argument based on the Brock by invoking the imbedded property rule which states that lost property which is imbedded on a piece of property goes to the owner of the property on which the lost property is embedded (Corhill v. Wenner). This rule was established with an equitable state of mind; if someone buys a piece of property, they have a reasonable understanding that they own everything on and in the property. Given the two established rules listed here, I believe that you should return the gold coins to Alex and Brock. Regarding your growler you may be in luck. Although it sounds like you got frustrated an abandoned your growler after hearing that it may have been broken, you do have an argument based on the Bailment doctrine. The rule regarding bailments is that if you (the bailor) give the growler to the brewery (bailee) and it is a customary transaction that should come with a reasonable belief that your property will be safe with them, then you have a right to collect damages, if the property is damaged (Hyatt case). I believe that you have a strong case to collect damages on the grounds that you created a bailment when you paid the brewery to fill your growler. Since part of refilling the growler necesitates you handing your property over to the brewery, they accept responsability to keep it safe and return it in the same condition it was in when they received it from you. As for your jacket, I believe that you may be out of luck. The nature in which you left the brewery could constitute an abandonment of your jacket. Rather than looking around for the jacket, you got frustrated and left the establishment. The rule of law regarding abandoned property is that the finder has an exclusive right over all others (Armory). I would definitely suggest contacting the brewery and inquiring as to the whereabouts of your jacket since someone may have turned it in. If that is not the case and someone took the jacket, they now have a possessory right which supercedes your own. You could potentially argue that you mislaid the jacket, which means that you intentionally placed it somewhere in the brewery and forgot where it was in which case the brewery would have a right to the jacket over all others except you. If, you are able to locate the individual or buisness that has your jacket and they are not willing to return the item, you can file an action for replevin which will allow you to retrieve your property. 1C) At the time Alex (grantor) deeds the 5 acres of land to David (grantee), david has an interest in fee simple subject to executory limitation while Frank and Fred (third parties) have future executory interests in the fee simple. At the time that David begins using the property for non-residential purposes, the property title shifts from David to Frank and Fred. Frank's and Fred's interests cut David's interest short becuase David violated the one condition that Alex made when he created the deed. If David refuses to concede the title, Frank and Fred have the right to take him to court under a replevin cause of action. At the time Alex (grantor) sells the other five acres to Edward (Grantee), Edward has an interest in fee simple subject to executory limitation while Frank and Fred (third parties) have future executory interests in the fee simple. At the time that David begins using the property for non-residential purposes, the property title shifts from David to Frank and Fred. Frank's and Fred's interests cut David's interest short becuase David violated the one condition that Alex made when he created the deed. If David refuses to concede the title, Frank and Fred have the right to take him to court under a replevin cause of action. At the time Alex (grantor) sells the other five acres to Edward (Grantee), Edward has an interest in fee simple subject to condition subsequent which means that Alex as a future interest of possibility of re- entry. When Edward violated the condition set forth in the grant, Alex had a right to re-enter and reclaim his property. To reclaim property through right of re-entry, Alex must go through the courts to restore his title in the land. "," The main issue here is whether or not Betty has a right to the greenacre lot. There is an arguement to be made for Debbie regarding the doctrine of color of title. The rule of law regarding color of title states that if the party with a false title to the land occupies said land for a period extending beyond the statutory period without any occupation by the original owner, then the party with the false title gains a legal title to the land. If the original owner is physically present on the land and the party with the false title meets the criteria for adverse possession (continuous, Actual, Hostile, Open and Notoriuous, Exlusive, and meets the statutory period) on a piece of the property, in this case the small chunk of land with the house, then party with the false title gains a legal title to the small piece of land they have been occupying. In This case, Debbie has been occupying the land with a false title for 8 years (the statutory period for adverse possession is generally longer than 8 years) when her posssession is interupted by Betty. If the statutory period is less than 8 years, the court will have to rule in favor of Debbie, but if the staturory period is greater than 8 years there could be arguments made by both sides. Debbie could argue that, although she has not been in possession of greenacre for more than the statutory period, her father was in partial possession, a weekend warrior occupied the property for 9 years which added to Debbie's 8 years would likely meet the statutory period. Adverse possessors are allowed to tack on possession time when it is in good faith (Tieu v. Morgan). Betty could rebute this argument with an argument that Chris' possession did not meet the ""actual"" requirement for adverse possession since he simply visited the property for5 vacations and did not live there full time. Debbie could also argue that Chris made good faith improvements, as has debbie. The rule with good faith improvements, is if a party, in good faith, takes property from another and makes improvements that statutory period, her father was in partial possession, a weekend warrior occupied the property for 9 years which added to Debbie's 8 years would likely meet the statutory period. Adverse possessors are allowed to tack on possession time when it is in good faith (Tieu v. Morgan). Betty could rebute this argument with an argument that Chris' possession did not meet the ""actual"" requirement for adverse possession since he simply visited the property for vacations and did not live there full time. Debbie could also argue that Chris made good faith improvements, as has debbie. The rule with good faith improvements, is if a party, in good faith, takes property from another and makes improvements that would make returning the improved property inequitable, then the good faith improver gets to keep the product and may be ordered to compensate the other party with a monetary remedy (Wetherbee v. Green). In This case, Debbie's father made improvements by enlarging and insulating the little cabin and Debbie decided to build a house on the property. While these are legitimate arguments, Betty could argue that since she was a tenant in entirety with Andrew, he never had a legal right to sell the property or forge her name. Tenants in Entirety are allowed to sell property but only with consent from the other tenant (US v Craftt). The court will look for an equitable remedy as it always does and may meet in the middle. Although a statutory period for color of title may not have been met, they could rule in favor of Debbie to keep the house and a small chunk of land that it sits on, on the basis of good faith improvements. If the court rules this way, Betty could receive the remainder of the property as a remedy or they could request that Debbie compensate Betty for the value of the property pre-good faith improvements.

57b9fae7-1947-436c-9f3e-be7e3992ecea," Since we know both Connor and Carla are alive and work full time, one or both will likely at some point retire, assuming both don't die pre-retirment. That is valid under RAP. The first one to pass the post here (and retire) will inherit a present possessory life estate. Robert, who is alive, has a reminder in life estate. The grandchildren, an open class perhaps not yet filled, has a remainder in fee simple, subject to partial/open divestment. We simply don't know which grandchildren will, actually reach twenty five, excpet for Victor, who is already 26. Thus, Victor, has a a vested remainder in fee simple. The fact that Vivian, 17, is close to reach 25 isn't particularly relevant, because either Connor and Carla both could have children, or he could in theory, because he is a male, have a child into his 70s. For clarity and to avoid the implicaiton of RAP, Oliver should rewrite his grant as follows: To the first of my children, Connor or Carla, to retire, for life, then to my nephew Robert for life. You could also eliminate Robert and say to ""my now-living grandchildren who reach 25."" But, it is too ambigious to say granchildren generally. We simply don't know whether these non existing grandchildren will vest within the life in being plus 21 years. The Rule of convenience might result in the court's striking of any open classes, instead narrowing the grant to include only those living, namely Connor, Carla, Robert, Victor, and Vivian. "," 1a) First and foremost, Brock's request--and thus the chief issue at hand--is whether there exists a legal avenue by which he can make some money off the developer. As a member of a tenancy in common, Brock has rights. Since, given the facts, Brock and his brother, the co-tenant in common and other properietor of their shared business, have vastly diverging opinions on what they should do with their property, Brock and his brother have a percolating dispute. It will be important that Brock understand his rights as a tenant in common. Accordingly, what Brock needs resolved involves what rights he has-- and, therefore, can exerciese--as a tenant in common with his brother, Alex. My first piece of advice to Brock would be that tenants in common (of which Brock is one with his brother, Alex) enjoy equal rights of use, entry, posession, and enjoyment as against their co-tenants. Therefore, based on his valid title that he acquired through payment and his brother's subsequent conveyance of half of his share, Brock possessed a fully valid tenancy in common. Brock should argue that he held up his end of the bargain and was merely trying to exercise his right as a tenant in common to explore the possibility of conveying away his interest. Because the property obviously would be more valuable as a full sale rather than a partial sale, Brock attempted to persuade his brother to sell as well. Although Alex grew upset and said no, Brock did nothing wrong. He has every right to explore his options to convey away his interest at any time A key issue in any dispute will likely send us running back to perhaps the most improtant part of any conveyance: the actual words and intent of the grantor. In 2003, when Brock recieved Alex's invitation to join him in business, Alex paid his brother in exchange for half of the business and half of the warehouse site. Alex's language in the deed of record reads as follows: ""I, Alex Apple, hereby grant this land to myself and my brother Brock to hold jointly as tenants in common."" Here, as the language suggests, Alex has relinquished one half of his interest in both his business and the half of the warehouse site, leaving him with a 50% share and brock with a 50% share. Brock will argue that per the wording of the deed, he did his part. His was a 50% tenant in common and acted as he saw fit. Alex, of course, will vehmently disagree. He will argue that when he conveyed away 50% of his interest in his tenancy to Brock, he expected--and the intent of his words demonstrate--his brother to be an ctive participant in running the business and stewarding the property. I would advise Brock that while Alex's arguments may evoke an emotional respsonse, they nonetheless carry little water legally. Indeed, the words of the deed are clear--and courts are hesistant to intsert themselves to rewrite deeds unless warehouse site, leaving him with a 50% share and brock with a 50% share. Brock will argue that per the wording of the deed, he did his part. His was a 50% tenant in common and acted as he saw fit. Alex, of course, will vehmently disagree. He will argue that when he conveyed away 50% of his interest in tenancy to Brock, he expected--and the intent of his words demonstrate--his brother to be an ctive participant in running the business and stewarding the property. I would advise Brock that while Alex's arguments may evoke an emotional respsonse, they nonetheless carry little water legally. Indeed, the words of the deed are clear--and courts are hesistant to intsert themselves to rewrite deeds unless prudence necessitates such an intervention. Here despite, Alex's claims, it does not. If Alex wanted to hold the property and business together and manage its every decision, he should have never conveyed away his 50% share. A key practical concern will be how Alex should go about making some money off this developer. An preferable way would be to mediate with his brother, since that allowas for flexibility and can be suspended at any time. Both sides would also avoid the sky-high costs and uncertainity that litigation involves. I would advise Brock that should his brother not agree to mediation, that he should consider the possibility of litigation. Indeed, I would tell Brock that he could ask a judge to grant either a partition in kind or a partition by sale. As the court in Delfino v. Valencios held, courts tender to prefer a partition in kind to a partition by sale so as to preserve the property rights of those who do not want to leave their home. The relevant facts in Delfino is that co-tenants of a parcel of land found themselves in a dispute over the use of the property. Ms. Delfino lived on the property--set aside, in the corner--and operated some of her trash business on the lot. Namely, Ms. Delfino stored the trash on the lot. The V's argued that the trash storage would be unpalatable to the future residents of their development. The court will also need to decide the issue of whether Alex ousted Brock. I would further advise Brock that in telling him to ""get out of here and don't come back!"" Alex outsed his brother, Brock, thereby depriving him of his full rights as a 50% interest-holding in a tenancy in common. Brock, therefore, should assert his claim to collect rent for the fair market value. As the court held in Martin v. Martin, co-tenants do not owe each rent--and can not ask each other for rent--unless one co-tenant ousts the other, thereby depriving him of his right to make use of the property, or is owed money on acocunt of carrying the cost for utitlities or other costs that should be shared in common. Following the rule set out in Martin, Brock will argue that he could no longer use the property and therefore was constructively outsted. He will argue that he is entitled to his share of the rent as dictated by the free market. In contrast, Alex will argue that he made his statement under emotional duress. He did not oust his brother, he will argue. Furthermore, although a weak argument legally, Alex might claim that, as his brother, Brock should have none that this was a quarrel between brothers that would soon pass. Furthermore, Alex will argue that these were mere words--he never to any physical measures to codify his threat of carrying the cost for utitlities or other costs that should be shared in common. Following the rule set out in Martin, Brock will argue that he could no longer use the property and therefore was constructively outsted. He will argue that he is entitled to his share of the rent as dictated by the free market. In contrast, Alex will argue that he made his statement under emotional duress. He did not oust his brother, he will argue. Furthermore, although a weak argument legally, Alex might claim that, as his brother, Brock should have none that this was a quarrel between brothers that would soon pass. Furthermore, Alex will argue that these were mere words--he never to any physical measures to codify his threat of ouster. He never locked the doors, and he never had security place Alex on a ""not permitted ot enter list."" The court, on these grounds, will likely find--although by no means clear cut--that Alex did oust his brother, Brock. If a partition by sale does go through (very unlikely), the court will need to decide the issue of what is owed to whom. Like in Delfino, Brock should assert his claim to an owelty payment. By virtue of the sale, which Brock brokered and brough to the fledgling joint tenancy, Brock will substantially increase the value of his brother's property. Therefore, as in Delfino, the court should award Brock. Alex may asset a weak Keeble claim, arguing that by seeking out sweetheart development deals, Brock is maliciously interfering with his brother's business and livelihood. The Keeble rule says that landowners and business owners are free ot earn their living without malicious outside interference (i.e. Hickeringill scaring away the ducks and depriving Keeble of the fruits of his labor; H would have been okay had he simply competed and set up a competior decy pond). Brock should respond that while Alex may not be happy with him, he is folliowing the law and asserting his rights to convey away his interest as a tenant in common. Either in creative negotations or in court, Brock should implore the court to order--or his other party to accept--a proviso in any conveyance Brock makes of his share, that allows for his brother Alex to retain his interest in the tenancy in common, at least insofar as he continue to hold his 50% share in the land and own and operate his buesiness (unless he elects for a buyout Since Alex attached no conditions to his grant, Brock should not have to worry about whether he was a good steward of the business. Indeed, the only time Alex may have a recoverable claim against his brother relying on Brock's suppsoed lack of interest and care in the business would come when Furthermore, Alex failed to attach conditions to his grant. In other words, had he changed this fee simple to add a condition subsequent saying ""provided that Brock pulls his weight and maintains an interest in the sound functioning of the land and business,"" then things might be different. But that onus was on Alex, the grantor. good steward of the business. Indeed, the only time Alex may have a recoverable claim against his brother relying on Brock's suppsoed lack of interest and care in the business would come when Furthermore, Alex failed to attach conditions to his grant. In other words, had he changed this fee simple to add a condition subsequent saying ""provided that Brock pulls his weight and maintains an interest in the sound functioning of the land and business,"" then things might be different. But that onus was on Alex, the grantor. Alex will argue that even though he voluntarily reliquished half of his business to his brother, Brock, in exchange for consideration of money, that he is the one with the greater interest in the enterprise. Furthermore, Alex will argue that his interest goes over and above that of his absentee and nonchalant brother. After all, Alex will claim, Alex manages the affairs of the business, bearing the brunt of the financial and emotional burddens. The court will likely find that Brock can convey away his 50% share of the tenancy in common. 1b) The issue here is one of finder's law and treasure. Carl will argue that his a lawfulk finder of the gold coins. But Brock and Alex, arguing the ad coleum doctrine (that is, that the own everything from the earth to the sky, will argue that the property is theirs. Like in the case where the contractor found ""treasure,"" in the soil, the court will likely find that the property belongs to Brock and Alex, in common. Carl will say this case is more like Armory, in which the chimney sweep found a jewel. He will say that, in his ordinary course of business, he found something of value. He has a right of possession to it that is superior as against anyone in the whole except the true owner. He will say that it is improtant to recognize the prima facie property right that exists in posession alone. Furthermore, he will argue that, given the name of the grocery store, he will argue that the true owner is NOT Alex and Brock, but rather a patron of the grocery store. Courts have found that treasure trove is not really in line with modern values and principles. We like to say, instead that people own the posessions on their parcels of land; therefore, on this issue, the court will likely find that Alex and Brock own the coins. On the growler, there is an issue of bailment. A bailment is when you voluntarily reliquish posession without giving away title. Classic bailment situations include dry cleaners, coat, checks, and valets. In these case, you give up your property for a period time, recieive a ticket to claim it back, and expect that your property will be waiting for your, in at least not worse shape as then when you left it, when your return. In a bailment relationship, the bailee has a duty of care to make sure your property stays say, instead that people own the posessions on their parcels of land; therefore, on this issue, the court will likely find that Alex and Brock own the coins. On the growler, there is an issue of bailment. A bailment is when you voluntarily reliquish posession without giving away title. Classic bailment situations include dry cleaners, coat, checks, and valets. In these case, you give up your property for a period of time, recieive a ticket to claim it back, and expect that your property will be waiting for your, in at least not worse shape as then when you left it, when your return. In a bailment relationship, the bailee has a duty of care to make sure your property stays safe and is returned. Here, Carl has a strong claim that his growler was lost or dmaaged at the hands of the bartender/store employee. As in Allen v. Hyatt-Regency Nashville, where a bailement relationship was formed by parking a car in a closed garage, Carl will have a strong claim, that the store breached its duty by breaking/losing/not returning his beer mug. Carl should advance a claim both for nominal damages--to recoup the actual cost of the mug--and punitive damages because, to Carl, this growler is priceless--he should argue it was a gift form a friend carrying extreme sentimental value and is irreplacebale. The brewery and its employees will counter argue that this was not a bailement relationship and that Carl should have monitored his property. They neevr asusmed a duty of care. The court, in response, to the brewery/employee's weak arguments, should, find that the store breached its duty to Carl to return his growler. Another issue the court will need to resolve has to do with lost, mislaid, and abondoned property. Because Carl gave up and finding his coat and said ""forget it"", he likely abandoned it. Even though he is upset over leaving it, he chose to abandon it ait and thus likely has no ownership claim. Carl will argue that he never intended to leave the coat and merely mislaid it, as in the McAvoy case in which a patron mislaid his bag in a barber shop. Carl should say he was upset about his growler and too stressed to find his coat, but he never fully abandoned it. If anything, at worst, he should say he lost it, so he maitains the superior claim to title over and above any and all subsequent finders. The court will likely find that Carl abandoned the coat. 1c) First issue is who has rights over the property. We can forget about Brock, since he conveyed away his rights to Carl. Brock no longer has a horse in the 7race. Next, we will have to assess the issue of Alex's decision to convey away his interest. We need to look at The court will likely find that Carl abandoned the coat. 1c) First issue is who has rights over the property. We can forget about Brock, since he conveyed away his rights to Carl. Brock no longer has a horse in the race. Next, we will have to assess the issue of Alex's decision to convey away his interest. We need to look at each grant, especially his langauge, seperately. First, in selling 5 vacant areas of the land to DD (""To Daid, so long as the property is used for residential uses only; if it is ever used for non-residential uses, then to my two sons, Frank and Fred). Here, David has a fee simple determinable. The duration so long as lasts as long he is t using the proepry for residential use only. Fred and Frank have a third-party executory interest, since if the condition is met, there is no reversion to the grantor. When DD decides to incorprorate commercial spaces, he violates the deed and thus conveys his share to Frank and Fred. David will argue that he did what was economically necessarry, but the words of the grant are clear. Fee simple determinables deal with temporal limits and durations. Here, the limit is clear--so long as residential use. Alex has no claim against David, since he has no reversion. The next issue we have to assess is Edward's right over his property. ""To Edward and his heirs so long as the premises are never used to make IPAs, and if IPAs are ever made on the premises, Alex has the right to re-enter and reclaim the premises."" Here, Alex has createtd a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. We look for language ""provided that."" The right of re-entry is not automatic. Indeed, the onus is on Alex to re enter and re take control. 2) "," The first issue the court must examine is what right tenants by the entirety have. Tenancy by the entirety, not recognizes in all states has been traditionally meant to require satisfication of the four entities (person, instrument, time, and title), plus one: marriage. Historically, of course, marriage referred to a man and woman, but modern courts, per changing law and custom, have extended the right to protect is really of no moment here, since in the case at non-heterosexual couples to. That background, though, hand, Andrew and Betty were a wealthy, married couple. The first issue the court must examine is what right tenants by the entirety have. Tenancy by the entirety, not recognizes in all states has been traditionally meant to require satisfication of the four entities (person, instrument, time, and title), plus one: marriage. Historically, of course, marriage referred to a man and woman, but modern courts, per changing law and custom, have extended the right to protect non-heterosexual couples to. That background, though, is really of no moment here, since in the case at hand, Andrew and Betty were a wealthy, married couple. The second, critical issue is what can dissolve a tenancy by the entirety. In other words, becasue Andrew and Betty weren't particularly close and ooften lived apart and were dishonest and estranged but never got divorced, are they still tenants by the entirety. Another key issue will be whether one party in a tenancy by the entirety can unilaterally encumber the property. In other words, since Andrew acted on his own, without merely consulting Betty, there might be a question of whether he even had the right to convey title to Chris for cash. As the court in US v. Allen held, one member of a married couple in a tenancy by the entirety can encumber the other. After all, as the court held, a holding of the opposite would be dangerous and encourage tax evasion. In that case, the federal governemnt placed a tax lien on the property in order to take a security in the property of a husband deliquent in the paying of federal income taxes. Trying to make a cute and deceitful maneuever, the couple had the property conveyed over to the wife to try to avoid the notortious reach of the ever-scrupulous IRS. The court found this was inappropriate since it was deceitful and the husband encumbered boht parties as a tenant by the entirery with his wife. Adverse possession is a big issue in this case. In order to adversely possess a piece of property, the AP must show the following kinds of possession: continuous, actual, hostile, open and notorious, and exclusive. In addiiton, he/she must do so continuously (per element one above) for the duration of the statutory period. In the New Suffolk Jurisdiction, that statutory period is ten years. Should the true owner become disabled, he/she shall have seven years to bring an action. The first issue of adverse possesion is whether the neighbors (who used the land to hunt and fish) who crossed greenacre adversely possessed. They likely meet the element of contiuous, since Andrew always allowed them over the years. The probably do not meet actual, since they did so with the permission of Andrew and didn't treat it as their own. They probably also don't meet hostile, since they didn't act as though it was theirs. Open and notorious might be met, since Andrew was watching, so this set of facts departs from Manillo v Gorski, in which one party didn't know that the others staircase extended 15 inches on the other's property line. The other party has to be patently aware. And the exclusive element is not met, since we have no evdience in the facts provided that the hunters and crossed greenacre adversely possessed. They likely meet the element of contiuous, since Andrew always allowed them over the years. The probably do not meet actual, since they did so with the permission of Andrew and didn't treat it as their own. They probably also don't meet hostile, since they didn't act as though it was theirs. Open and notorious might be met, since Andrew was watching, so this set of facts departs from Manillo v Gorski, in which one party didn't know that the others staircase extended 15 inches on the other's property line. The other party has to be patently aware. And the exclusive element is not met, since we have no evdience in the facts provided that the hunters and fishers used the property to the exclusion of others, including Andrew, the true owner. Although he didn't know it at the time, Chris began adversely possessing the property (as against both Betty and really Andrew, too, since it is an improper conveyance). Chris had what he thought and appeared to be a good title and acted as such. Most jurisdicitons don't look to the subjective standards of good faith/bad faith and instead look to see if the objective elemenets of AP are met. Here, Betty might claims that like in Kowlin, Chris was a bad faith purchaser. He was Andrew's friend and should have known Betty never signed the will and it thus was improper. Chris could counter argue that it is not in his purview. Another issue is waste and who gets what. Chris is also a property improver. Improvers are usually only entitled to the land if they substantially convert the property, increasing its value and making it unrecongiznable. Chris's ""waste' is likely amelioraitve, meaning he increased the value of the property and improved it htough he didn;'t have permisison. The other kinds of imporvement are permissive (which is allowing it fall into disrepair) and voluntary/affirmative, meaning to knowlingly try to destory its value. Chris has a strong claim to ameliorative, though Betty may make a weak claim for voluntary. Court will likely find amelioriative. Chris will argue he was a property improver. Betty can argue that per Johnson v. Brownson any action that results in a decrease in inheritance constititues waste. She could say that Chris's adverse possession meets the statutory requirement. He was also continuous, and spent eight weeks per year (like a vacation home), he possesed it actually and treated it as his own, he hwas hostile under color of title, he was open and notorious, and he was exclusive, since he only allowed his neighbors (and no one) to hunt and fish when he wasn't there. This is like letting someone use your pool in the summer or play hockey on your backyard pond or rink in the winter. Betty will argue that this AP was not open and notorious because she didn't know about it. Betty will weeks per year (like a vacation home), he possesed it actually and treated it as his own, he hwas hostile under color of title, he was open and notorious, and he was exclusive, since he only allowed his neighbors (and no one) to hunt and fish when he wasn't there. This is like letting someone use your pool in the summer or play hockey on your backyard pond or rink in the winter. Betty will argue that this AP was not open and notorious because she didn't know about it. Betty will have a very strong claim here. Chris might claim that Betty never came and could have never seen the property, but courts lean strongly towars protecting property owners. That said, Chris can have a storng claim that Betty didn't even know she owned Greenacre, and therefore was sleepy owner. He, by contrast, improved the property and made it vibrant. Betty can argue Chris lost his claim like in Cahill. Although there was no offer to purchase here like there was on lot 18, she could make a weak argument that he should have known this wasn't his and therefore knew he couldn't exercise and assert AP. She could also make a creative claim of disability and ask for 7 years since she was kept in the dark by her husband. Chris will argue she was a sleeping owner and shoud have known Deborah will argue the same points as Chris, going even further as to saying she built In the end the court will likely find that while Betty would have had a strong claim against Chris, too much time has passed and Debbie is the rightful owner. Because Chris and debbie, his daughter, made a voluntary devise and conveyance and were in privity, they can tack on the time of their collective AP to satisfy the 10-year stuatutory requirment. By tacking on her AP claim as in privity with her father's and under color of title, Debbie likely wins out over Betty, a sleeping owner.

031928ff-6248-4987-bb30-75af9273ea92," Without Rule Against Perpetuities: Connor and Carla have springing executory interests in life estate. Oliver's unborn children also have a springing executory interest in life estate. Robert has a remainder in life estate. Victor has a vested remainder in fee simple subject to open, and Vivian has an executory interest in fee simple because her interest can partially divest Victor's interest. Unborn grandchildren would also have an executory interest in fee simple because they can partially divest Victor's interest. RAP: Under the Rule Against Perpetuities interests subject to the rule which include contingent remainders, executory interests, and vested remainders subject to open are void if they do not necessarily vest (or close) or fail within 21 years of a life in being at the time of conveyance. Connor and Carla's springing executory interests in life estate are valid under the Rule Against Perpetuities becaus they are their own lives in being; they are their own validating lives. By the end of each of their lives we will know whether or not they were the first of Oliver's children to retire. Oliver's unborn children, however, cannot be their own validating lives under RAP because they were not alive at the time of conveyance; thus their interest is void. The unborn children may be born after the time of conveyance, then everyone living at the time of conveyance may die, then one of them may not retire (and thus their interest would not vest) until over 21 years after the last life in being died. Because Connor and Carla's valid interest is tied in with the unborn children's void interest, it is not clear to me whether or not the entire interest would need to be struck from the language or not. Oliver's grandchildren's contingent remainder is valid under the rule against perpetuities thanks only to the rule of convenience. The rule of convenience says that a remainder subject to open may be deemed valid even if it does not necessarily close within 21 years of a life in being IF there is an individual that already satisfies the interest's precondition, but that upon conveyance that class closes including only those who have satisfied the required precondition. Because the class is closed, any other potential interests disappear. Thus, under the rule against perpetuties: Connor and Carla have springing executory interests in life estate. Robert has a vested remainder in life estate, and Victor has a vested remainder in life estate. valid even if it does not necessarily close within 21 years of a life in being IF there is an individual that already satisfies the interest's precondition, but that upon conveyance that class closes including only those who have satisfied the required precondition.

"," 1 (a) Brock, there is an issue as to whether you are tenants in common with your brother or joint tenants based on the grant given to you by your brother in exchange for the money you paid him. The language of the grant was ""to hold jointly as tenants in common"" which is ambiguous and might communicate either a tenancy in common or a joint tenancy; however, under the rules of construction of a grant, there is a preference for a tenancy in common because courts believe that the right of survivorship which comes with a joint tenancy is a very specific right that grantors ought to understand they are giving and thus must be very explicit if they want a cotenancy involving the right of survivorship. The right of survivorship is when the death of one cotenant triggers an automatic transfer of the deceased cotenant's share of the property to the surviving cotenant. Thus, you likely have a tenancy in common. There is also an issue as to whether or not you will be able to parition this tenancy in common with your brother by sale. You will prefer to partition it by sale because you will get more money for doing so and will likely be able to sell it to the developer. However, under Delfino v. Vealencis, courts have a preference for partitions in kind which are physical partitions of property. They prefer this kind of a partition because they see it is as unfair for courts to forcibly sell property against a cotenant's will. (however, in reality partition by sale is more frequent than partition in kind). Delfino tells us partition by sale must only be done in an emergency-- to determine if a partition by sale is appropraite one must decide (1) If if is impractical to physically partition the land because of the physical properties of the land and (2) if it is in the interest of both cotenants to partition by sale. The Delfino case also found that interests in this circumstance must not be merely economic; even thought it was in the defendant's best economic interest to partition her property by sale, because she had lived on the property for so long, had her business there, and because the property had been in her family for years, the court ruled that partition by sale was inappropriate. Since your tenancy in common property is 10 acres, pretty large, it would not be too difficult to physically partition the land, although it may be difficult to ascertain which parts would go to whom since different parts of the land may be more valuable than others. Because of this likelihood this element may not be too difficult for you to satisfy. However, your brother has interests in this circumstance must not be merely economic; even thought it was in the defendant's best economic interest to partition her property by sale, because she had lived on the property for so long, had her business there, and because the property had been in her family for years, the court ruled that partition by sale was inappropriate. Since your tenancy in common property is 10 acres, pretty large, it would not be too difficult to physically partition the land, although it may be difficult to ascertain which parts would go to whom since different parts of the land may be more valuable than others. Because of this likelihood this element may not be too difficult for you to satisfy. However, your brother has expressed that he is emotionally invested in this property and told you that he loved it. He may try to argue that because of that he has significant personal interest in the property. This would not be convincing, however, because he has only had this property for about 4 years and the economic advantages for both you and him would appear to overwhelm any of his miniscule personal interests Alex may have. However, if the court did order a partition by sale, and, say, Alex recieved the more valuable portion of the land, you would likely be able to recieve owlety payments for that disparity. Finally, I would also like to point out that you may want to sue your brother for rent since it would appear as though he has ousted you from the property. As explained in the case Martin v. Martin, a cotenant may only collect rent for the fair market value of his share if there exists either an agreement to rent, or if the nonpossessing cotenant has been ousted. Ouster is when one cotenant is forcibly removed from the property. It would appear as though by him telling you not to return, that may be enough to constitute ouster, thus allowing you to collect rent from Alex, unless of course you really are allowed back on the property, in which case, you would not be able to collect rent. 1 (b) Carl, I am sorry to hear about your growler and your coat, but that is exciting about the coins. There is an issue as to whether or not you may keep the coins. Finders law of property would apply here because you found this property in a hole in the Warehouse. Under finders law, property may be lost, mislaid, treasure trove/embedded (jurisdiction dependent), or abandoned. The coins clearly seem not to be lost since they were wrapped in a plastic bag and seemed to have been intentionally put in this area of the warehouse since it is a small, very particular space. There is a good chance that this property is either mislaid or embedded because of that seemingly purposeful move. Two cases come to mind: Benjamin v. Linder Air Transport, and Corliss v. Wenner. In Benjamin, money that had been wrapped and carefully placed in the wing of a plane was deemed to be mislaid property because it was inside a plane and it was intentionally placed there. Mislaid property the9 property in question is ""laid""; thus the owner of gives title to the owner of the property upon which the plane had superior claim to the money. The policy reasoning behind this is that mislaid property is more likely to be found if kept at the place where it was left whereas lost property may go to the finder There is a good chance that this property is either mislaid or embedded because of that seemingly purposeful move. Two cases come to mind: Benjamin v. Linder Air Transport, and Corliss v. Wenner. In Benjamin, money that had been wrapped and carefully placed in the wing of a plane was deemed to be mislaid property because it was inside a plane and it was intentionally placed there. Mislaid property gives title to the owner of the property upon which the property in question is ""laid""; thus the owner of the plane had superior claim to the money. The policy reasoning behind this is that mislaid property is more likely to be found if kept at the place where it was left whereas lost property may go to the finder since it is less likely that the true owner of lost property would return to the spot it was lost. The Corliss case was a state case in which the state abandoned the doctrine of treasure trove which says that a finder who finds ancient property, usually buried in the ground and intentionally placed there, has superior claim to the title of said property over the person that owns the property upon which it was found; instead the court adopted the idea of embedded property, which, similar to mislaid property, gave superior title to the owner of the property on which it was found. The policy behind this was that the court did not want to incentivize trespass by rewarding trespassers with any ""treasure trove"" found on the property. These cases would make it very difficult for you to keep the gold coins as either defining the coins as embedded property or mislaid property would give the brewery superior title. If, however, you were able to convince the court that treasure trove should apply because the coins are so old and from the late 1800s. Finally, you may try to argue that this property was, in fact, abandoned since it was in a plastic bag from the local grocery store, meaning that the coins were likely placed there recently and intentionally and were perhaps abandoned by someone recently rather than placed their eons ago and simply forgotten (as treasure trove might have it). There is an issue as to whether or not you will be able to gain a presumption of negligence by the brewery over your growler via a bailment theory. Under a bailment, a piece of property is tranferred temporarily from a bailor (owner of the property) to a baillee (receiver of the property); in order for a bailment to have occurred you would have had to delivered the piece of property to the bailee and the bailee must have gained full control and dominion over it. Under Allen v. Hyatt Regency a bailment was found to have existed when the plaintiff entered a gated parking garage, took a ticket and left the garage. This bailment meant that a presumption of negligence on the part of the bailee existed when the property thereafter went missing. In regard to the growler you have a great claim that negligence ought to be presumed since you delivered the property to the bartender, he gave you a ticket to identify the growler, and he gained full dominion and control over it when you handed it to him. Thus, there should easily be a presumption of negligence. Admittedly, this would be an implied bailment absent any written contract bailee must have gained full control and dominion over it. Under Allen v. Hyatt Regency a bailment was found to have existed when the plaintiff entered a gated parking garage, took a ticket and left the garage. This bailment meant that a presumption of negligence on the part of the bailee existed when the property thereafter went missing. In regard to the growler you have a great claim that negligence ought to be presumed since you delivered the property to the bartender, he gave you a ticket to identify the growler, and he gained full dominion and control over it when you handed it to him. Thus, there should easily be a presumption of negligence. Admittedly, this would be an implied bailment absent any written contract (which may or may not be on your ticket, you should check!), but I don't think it would be difficult to prove, especially under Allen since you gave the bartender even more control than Allen had, who had not given his keys to the garage, and thus, (as the dissent would have it) did not give full control over his vehicile to the garage. There is also an issue as to whether or not you will be able to gain a presumption of negligence by the brewery over your coat via a bailment theory. As described above, a bailment requires a delivery and complete dominion over the property by the bailee. Your coat unfortunately was simply left on a coat hook and was not therefore delivered and handed to a bailee, and thus the court would very likely not consider this to be a bailment. The dissent in Allen v. Hyatt Regency would even more emphatically claim that no delivery took place and there was not total control and dominion over the property by the brewery. 1(c) Alex, there is an issue regarding whether the interest you conveyed to your sons is valid under the rule against perpetuities. You conveyed to David a fee simple subject to executory limitation, and you conveyed to your sons executory interests because David was to own the land ""so long as [it] is used for residential purposes only"" then to your sons. The rule against perpetuities applies to executory interests; thus we must determine if this executory interest will necessarily vest within 21 years of a life in being. Unfortunately, it will not because the property may be used for residential purposes for the next 500 years, and then suddenly not; in this situation, 21 years of a life in being at the time of conveyance have clearly passed. Thus the interest you gave to your sons is void and so the void language would follow the comma, and David would be left with a fee simple. (this might not be the case, however, under a ""wait and see"" regime, in which case you may already have a claim on your hands, and an executory interests would cause automatic transfer to the future interest holder once the condition stopped being met). There is also an issue regarding the interests made to Edward and the future interest you left in yourself. The language of the grant is ambiguous and may either be a fee simple subject to condition subsequent followed by a right of entry or a fee simple determinable followed by a possibility of reverter because it under a ""wait and see"" regime, in which case you may already have a claim on your hands, and an executory interests would cause automatic transfer to the future interest holder once the condition stopped being met). There is also an issue regarding the interests made to Edward and the future interest you left in yourself. The language of the grant is ambiguous and may either be a fee simple subject to condition subsequent followed by a right of entry or a fee simple determinable followed by a possibility of reverter because it has both language of duration and language of condition, neither of which would be subject to the rule against perpetuities because they are interests in the grantor. Generally, courts have a preference for a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent because it reduces the likelihood of the land changing hands. However, in Marenholz v. County School Board of Trustees, the court found that ambiguous language that could be interpreted as either words of condition or words of duration were held to be words of duration because it seemed from the grant that the intent of the grantor was to ensure that his estate could retake the property once the condition stopped being met automatically. A possibility of reverter becomes possessory automatically once the condition kicks in whereas a right of entry requires a grantor/his estate to take action and bring the case to court in order to make the interest possessory. In this case, I think the specific language of ""right to re-enter"" are too explicit to not be considered a right of entry and based on the rules of construction and the preference for a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, you possess a right of entry. Thus, you must bring this claim to court in order to quiet title and eject Edward. "," There is an issue as to whether or not Debbie has adversely possessed Greenacre given that the title which she inherited was faulty because Andrew was not empowered to convey his tenancy by the entirety property without the permission of his wife (the tenancy by the entirety was therefore not severed as it would be in a joint tenancy upon conveyance since he may not sell the property). In order to satisfy adverse possession the adverse possessory must have, in this state, had possession that was actual, open and notorious, continuous, exclusive, and hostile for 10 years. Debbie's possession was actual because actual requires actual trespass onto the property and she has actually been living there for the past 8 years. Debbie's possession was open and notorious because anyone that entered the property could see that she was using it as her own since she spent time there, built a year-round hosue on the land, and lived there full time. Debbie's possession was exclusive because although she allowed others to use her property, that is in line with how a normal property owner would use her property. In Cahill v. Morrow, an attempted actually been living there for the past 8 years. Debbie's possession was open and notorious because anyone that entered the property could see that she was using it as her own since she spent time there, built a year-round hosue on the land, and lived there full time. Debbie's possession was exclusive because although she allowed others to use her property, that is in line with how a normal property owner would use her property. In Cahill v. Morrow, an attempted adverse possessor was found to have satisfied the exclcusive element despite the fact that she allowed neighborhood children to use the property often to play, Debbie similarly lets her neighbors use her land. Debbie's possession is hostile because it is not with the permission of the true owner since the true owner is not Andrew who gave title to her father but the married couple of Andrew and Betty who were tenants by the entirety before he died and now Betty since she held the right of survivorship under her tenancy by the entirety with her husband. Depending on the jurisdiction, hostility may require good faith, bad faith, or, under Cahill v. Morrow, simply no objective manifestations of a mindset acknowledging that the adverse possessor does not have superior title to the land. Debbie would easily be able to satisfy either the good faith or the Cahill (majority) requirement, however, since she has color of title and thoroughly believes she rightfully possesses the land. The only issue Debbie may run into is determining whether or not her possession was continuous for 10 years. Debbie inherited the falty title in 2009, and it is not 2019, but Betty did not live on the property ""full time"" until 2011. Thus, unless the court found that less than full time possession was sufficient to satisfy the continuous requirement, Debbie would lose her adverse possession claim. However, there is a decent likelihood that the court would rule in Debbie's favor simply because the purpose of adverse possession is to reward productive use of land, and (in some ways) punish sleeping owners. Debbie, unlike Betty, has been using this land for 8 years now and has settled expectations that she has full title to it. The case Johnson v. M'Intosh demonstrates how settled expectations can influence the court since logically speaking taking away property from a current possessor who has every reason to believe she is rightfully possessing said land would ultimately be unfair to her. There is not really an issue as to privity since although she had privity with her father because she inherited this land from him which is a voluntary transfer, his possession would not tack on unless the court found that she started possessing the land ""continuously"" in 2009 when he devised it to her in his will, and, under that scenerio, she would have satisfied the statute of limitations period of New Suffolk, anyways. rightfully possessing said land would ultimately be unfair to her. There is not really an issue as to privity since although she had privity with her father because she inherited this land from him which is a voluntary transfer, his possession would not tack on unless the court found that she started possessing the land ""continuously"" in 2009 when he devised it to her in his will, and, under that scenerio, she would have satisfied the statute of limitations period of New Suffolk, anyways. Finally, were the court to rule that Debbie had adversely possessed the land, she would likely recieve full 50 acres of land because she possesses color of title. Under color of title, an adverse possessor that has ""color of title,"" a faulty instrument, may recieve not just the land she actually possesses and uses, but the entire land the faulty title gives her claim to so long as the true owner does not use the land. Betty was clearly not using the land, and she is the true owner since she possessed the right of survivorship in the tenancy by the entirety. Thus, Debbie would be able to adversely possess not just the two acres around her house, but the entire 50 acres. US v. Craft is a case that is relevent. ",494,2494,895
859a39b9-9607-4e0a-8527-9de148e3803b," Connor and Carla have life estates subject to executory limitation. Robert has an executory interest. Victor has a vested remainder subject to open and Vivian has an executory interest. Any futher children in the class will have executory interests, not contingent remainders. The clause that entitles the grandchildren to reach the age of 25 is not subject to RAP because Victor reaching the age of 25 vests the class open for future interests. If applying the rule of the convenience, the class would close because of Victor reaching the age of 25, leaving Vivian with an executory interest. "," A. Alex and Brock each own half of the brewery/warehouse site 50% as tenants in common. Alex and Brock are not joint tenants because the deed does not explicity combine them into a joint tenancy. After the offer from the real estate developer, Alex firmly does not want to sell the property, yet Brock wants to turn the profit and continue brewing elsewhere. Brock's possibilities are limited. Because the real estate developer wants to convert the warehouse and 10 acres into condos, Brock would be able to sell his share in half of the 10 acres. Brock should seek a partition in kind, where he can fairly divide the the warehouse and 10 acres from the warehouse. Because the real estate developer has no interest in purchasing the brewery and courts favor partitions in kind, a partition in kind may fairly divide Brock's interest from Alex's. Like in Vealencis, where the partition by sale was deemed unfair to the party that didnt own the house used for trash, a court may split this property in the favor of both Alex and Brock. Like the owner of the trash business in Vealencis, the courts may recognize the sentimental nature of the business and use that as a factor of splitting the brewery fairly from the remaining parcel of land. B. The issue regarding Carl discovering coins in Alex's brewery becomes problematic in applying finderr's law. A court will identify the coins from the 18th century as embedded property, which Alex will have the valid claim to possession. In Coriliss v. Wenner, workers find a jar of coins buried on the property of Wenner while building a driveway. The court granted ownership of the coins to the property owner, Wenner. The court reasoned because they do not want to recognize treasure trove finder's law, Like the owner of the trash business in Vealencis, the courts may recognize the sentimental nature of the business and use that as a factor of splitting the brewery fairly from the remaining parcel of land.

A court will identify the coins from the 18th century as embedded property, which Alex will have the valid claim to possession. In Coriliss v. Wenner, workers find a jar of coins buried on the property of Wenner while building a driveway. The court granted ownership of the coins to the property owner, Wenner. The court reasoned because they do not want to recognize treasure trove finder's law, which would grant ownership to the finder and promote unwanted trespasses from such finders, ownership of embedded property will go to the owner. Because the coins in the grocery bag were obscured in Alex's brewery and placed in a shopping bag from a store only opening 10 years before, a court will award ownership of the coins to Alex, and refute any possible treasure trove claims concerning the short time frame the coins could have resided in the brewery. Assertions of mislaid property, like the wallet forgotten in McAvoy v. Medina, will not suffice to grant Carl the coins. In Benjamin, the owner of the plane acquired the property from a previous owner like Alex did when he purchased a pre inhabited warehouse site. In Benjamin, workers discovered that a hidden cache of money lay in the compartment of the plane. The court ruled because the property was abandoned or lost, the ownership fo the cash should go to the owner of the property. Like the second hand purchaser in Benjamin, Alex will have the most valid claim to the discovered coins. Regarding the growler, Alex's brewery took complete possession of the property to hold and fill beer into. The brewery even gave him a ticket to confirm his property was changing hands. A bailment is created when partial or complete control of moveable property is voluntarily transferred to another party for a defined period of time. Alex's brewery violated a bailment when they accidentally destroyed Carl's growler. In Allen v. Hyatt Regency Hotel, the majority court found it sufficient to establish a bailment when Allen parked his car in an enclosed space monitored by security, with a ticket booth attendant, and ticket acting as a receipt when you enter and exit the garage. However, the minority opinion reacted by claiming a complete bailment was not achieved because the keys to the vehicle were never given to parking garage/hotel staff. Thus, in the minority, making Hyatt Regency not liable for damages for Allen's stolen vehicle. Because Carl completed a complete bailment, by transferring complete control of his growler with a ticket for confirmation of service, he will be entitled to recover under the minority opinion. Utilizing the more lenient majority Allen opinion, Carl will be entitled to recover damages for his destroyed growler as well. Regarding the coat, A court will likely determine that Carl abandoned his coat when he gave up searching for it in the brewery. Like in Benjamin, where the court asserted that the cash could have either Allen's stolen vehicle. Because Carl completed a complete bailment, by transferring complete control of his growler with a ticket for confirmation of service, he will be entitled to recover under the minority opinion. Utilizing the more lenient majority Allen opinion, Carl will be entitled to recover damages for his destroyed growler as well. Regarding the coat, A court will likely determine that Carl abandoned his coat when he gave up searching for it in the brewery. Like in Benjamin, where the court asserted that the cash could have either been intentionally abandoned or lost, the property goes to the owner. Here, Carl's jacket could be mislaid or abandoned. However, because of the intentional nature of leaving the coat behind, Carl forfeits property rights to coat when he abandons his search, by conceding, ""forget it."" C. In Alex's first deed, David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation. Frank and and Fred have shifting executory interests in the situation the property is not used for residential purposes. David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation because Fred and Frank can cut short David's possession if he ever utilized the property for non residential uses. Frank and Fred have shifting executory interests, because at the point of non residential use, possession shifts in fee simple to Frank and Fred, not back to Alex. For the second deed Edward and his heirs have a fee simple determinable, and Alex has a reverter. Edward had a fee simple determinable because if they use the brewery to brew IPA's Alex has to right to immediately reclaim title, without having to establish the right of reetry and make a physical presence on the property. Alex would not have to assert a right of entry, title to the brewery would immediately revert back to him after the first IPA was brewed on the premises. "," Was Andrew's sale of the property to Chris without his wife Betty's consent or knowledge a valid? No, because Tenants by the Entirety are interpreted to function as one person, like a corporation, both signatures are required to complete a valid sale of property. In US v. Craft, the court found the wife to be liable for the tax lein imposed by the US government for the husband's accruing of debt to cling to the wife's possession of the home to. The lein would not have terminated upon the husband's death. Andrew's sale to Chris was invalid without Betty's signature or consent, and Chris possesses a color of title to the 50 acres. Did Chris and Debbie satisfy all aspects of adverse possession while in possessing the property by color of title? Yes, Chris and Debbie satisfied the statutory period to claim adverse possession of 10 years in New Suffolk. From 2001-2009 Chris actually used the property, in the adverse possession the wife's possession of the home to. The lein would not have terminated upon the husband's death. Andrew's sale to Chris was invalid without Betty's signature or consent, and Chris possesses a color of title to the 50 acres. Did Chris and Debbie satisfy all aspects of adverse possession while in possessing the property by color of title? Yes, Chris and Debbie satisfied the statutory period to claim adverse possession of 10 years in New Suffolk. From 2001-2009 Chris actually used the property, in the adverse possession sense of the word. Performed a hostile possession believing the property was actualy his. In Cahill v. Morrow, one property owner satisfied the statutory period as well as all the elements of adverse possesion except hostile, by offering to purchase the home, recognizing a superior claim in the original property owner. Here, Chris genuinly believes he possesses a valid title to the 50 acres of land so his possession is hostile. Chris is continuously possessing the property as well. Even though he seasonally visits the cabin during the fishing season, this is valid continuous use for seasonal purpose. At all times is Chris requiring permission to be given for people to enter the property to go hunting, excluding even if he is away. Upon conveyance to Debbie, a court could tack the years required to complete an adverse possession and Debbie did not move to the property permanently in 2011 when her father died in 2009. Assuming Debbie continues the seasonal usage of Greenacre--implied by the ""decided to move their full time""--the continuous use of the property is satisfied under adverse possession in 2011. In Tieu v. Morgan, the court recognized the original owner of the adversely possessing property used the disputed strip of land in good faith, believing it was their property, and transferred the property to the next person who held the same belief in good faith. Here Debbie continues the chain of contiuous use of the property after Chris died in 2009 after adversely possessing for 8 years in 2009 and 10 years in 2011. Debbie only utilizes the 2 acres of land the house resides on, and doesnt exclude people from hunting or utilizing the other 48 acres. Debbie satisfies all elements of adverse possession from the period of 2009 to 2011 which satisfies the 10 year statutory requirement as well. Because Debbie moved to the cabin after her Chris's death in 2009, the years of adverse posession could have tacked on like in Tieu v. Morgan in 2011. Betty, because she did not visit the cabin on Greenacre at any point during that statutory period, cannot refute the adverse possession under color of title of Greenacre. Debbie improved the property while living on it and continuously possess the property for the statutory period of 10 years from 2009- 2011. In Marengo Cave, an owner did not become aware of a potential adverse possessor until they surveyed the cave beneath only to discover it extended under their land. The court ruled that the possession was not open and notorious by putting a reasonable owner on notice of possession. Betty Morgan in 2011. Betty, because she did not visit the cabin on Greenacre at any point during that statutory period, cannot refute the adverse possession under color of title of Greenacre. Debbie improved the property while living on it and continuously possess the property for the statutory period of 10 years from 2009- 2011. In Marengo Cave, an owner did not become aware of a potential adverse possessor until they surveyed the cave beneath only to discover it extended under their land. The court ruled that the possession was not open and notorious by putting a reasonable owner on notice of possession. Betty would have lost the property under adverse possession in 2009. because she has never visited the property. A court could grant color of title to the 2 acres she built a full-time home on in 2011 because she no longer excludes people from hunting and utilizing the other 48 acres. However, because Betty never asserted a claim to Greenacre until 2019, nor visited it at any point, Debbie could have seized the entire 50 acres under color of title in 2011. Because she did not perform reasonable care in maintaining or patrolling Greenacre, she will lose the property by color of title because her husband sold a invalid, but legitmate looking deed to Chris in 2001, who purchased it in good faith maintaining adverse possession from 2001-2008 and his daughter Debbie who willy likely tack on from 2008-2011.

88612715-125f-45a1-9776-7cfe9d79c629," Oliver Owner is the grantor who owns his property in fee simple and he is conveying his property to the first of his children to retire in a life estate. Oliver has two children who both currently work full time jobs, so they will retire at some point. His children, Carla and Connor, then both have springing executory interests because they both have future interests that cut short Oliver's present interest in fee simple subject to execuotry limitation. Once one of them reaches retirement, they acquire a present interest in a life estate, and the other child gets nothing. From the moment of conveyance, Robert retians a indefeasibly vested remainder in a life estate because there is no interest that cuts short his future interest. Oliver's grandchildren, Victor and Vivian, have two seperate interests at the time that the grant was conveyed. The conveyance gives any of Oliver's grandchildren the property once they turn 25, but it must be a remainder because they cannot cut short Robert's life estate. Victor, who is 26 and over the age requirmenet, has a vested interest in fee simple subject to open. This is because he has reached the necessary age for the interest to vest, and he now just needs to wait for the that to occur. Vivian, however, needs to be 8 years older to reach 25, so she only has an executory interest at this time. This is because she is waiting to partially divest the vested interest that Victor will acquire after Robert's death. Once Robert dies, Victor acquires a possessory estate in fee simple subject to executory limitation, and Vivian still retains an executory interest until she is of age. Additionally, if Oliver has any more grandchildren, they also possess an executory interest once they are born, but until then, they would have a contingent remainder in fee simple because they are unascertained people. Oliver would not retain a reversion because Victor already has a vested interest in fee simple subject to complete divestment, which would extinguish Oliver's reversion. The Rules against Perpetuity apply to Carla and Connor's springing executory interest, as well as Victor's vested remainder subject to open, and Vivian and her unascertianed siblings' executory interests. Robert's vested remainder in a life estate is not subject to RAP. Carla and Connor's interests are valid under the Rules against Perpetuity because they are their own validating lives. Even if Oliver, at the time of the conveyance so they can retire and every else but them dies, they are still lives in2being whenever they want to and the interest will vest withtin the limits of the RAP. However, the clause, ""then to my grabdchildren who reach the age of 25"" does is not valid uner the Rules against Perpetuity.

However, the clause, ""then to my grabdchildren who reach the age of 25"" does is not valid uner the Rules against Perpetuity. This is because if Oliver has a new child after the grant has been conveyed and then everybody else dies, that child is not a validating life. Then, 21 years could pass since the last life in being was alive, and Oliver's unnamed child born after the conveyance could have a new grandchild that would have to turn 25 for the interest to vest. In doign so, that interest would vest at a minimum four years too late for the itnterest to be valid uner the RAP. The new grant would then strike out the last clause of the grant and remain ""tot he first of my children to retire, for life, then to my nephew Robert for life."" Oliver would now retain a reversion in fee simple absolute after the RAP are applied. "," A. Concurent Tenancy Brock's first issue is whether or not he is able to able to convey any of this land to the developer due to his shared ownership of the warehouse with his brother, so first Brock would need to know his concurrent interests in the property with his brothers. Like in Harms v. Sprague where the conveyance of property was not ambiguous is the joint tenancy, courts would need explicit language to determine a joint tenancy or a tenancy by the entirety, otherwise the conveyance to two or more people is going to be a tenancy in common. Also, if there was a right of survivorship, like in a joint tenancy, then this issue would be solved a lot easier by Brock severing their joint tenancy by breaking one of the four unities: Time, Title, Possession, and Interest, but there was no words expalining a right of survivorship so that is not relevant to this case. The conveyance was also not a tenancy by the entirety because unlike the concurrent interests in the property with his brothers. Like in Harms v. Sprague where the conveyance of property was not ambiguous is the joint tenancy, courts would need explicit language to determine a joint tenancy or a tenancy by the entirety, otherwise the conveyance to two or more people is going to be a tenancy in common. Also, if there was a right of survivorship, like in a joint tenancy, then this issue would be solved a lot easier by Brock severing their joint tenancy by breaking one of the four unities: Time, Title, Possession, and Interest, but there was no words expalining a right of survivorship so that is not relevant to this case. The conveyance was also not a tenancy by the entirety because unlike the conveyance in U.S. v. Craft, it was never implied that Brock and Alex were married or wanted a right of survivorship, also they are brothers so there is no ambiguity there. This is because courts don't want to encourage alienability, so courts would likely ned to see the words, ""to Alex and Brock in a joint tenancy, with a right of survivorship"" to permit a joint tenancy. Instead, Brock and Alex's deed conveyed the land to themselves ""jointly as tenants in common"" which specifically limits their property rights as tenents in common. Their rights now, as tenants in common, can determine what Brock is able to do on the property in terms of sale to the develepor. Tenants in common have an undivided interest in the whole of the property that they own, but they have a seperate fractional interest in their financial interests of the property. If Brock wanted to sell the entirety of the property to the developer, like in Vealencis, he would need to bring an action for a partition. A partition is an action that divides the property of tenants in common in two ways: partition in kind and partition by sale. The partition by sale can only occur when the the land cannot be physcially divided up or the interests of the tenants in common will be benefited by the sale of their entire property. In this case, Brock would want to bring an acton for partition by sale, because it appears that their interests int he entire company, warehouse, and brewery itself are too difficult to divide physically. Adiditionally, a partition in sale woudl be lucratice for his brother and himself, with enough money to keep the brewery alive in a different location and have money to spend afterwards. Although his brother may argue that a partition by sale would not be in his best interest, Brock would likely be able to claim that a sale would benefit both of them more than the current value of their brewery, and Alex's dream and love can still live on in a different location. In doing so, Brock could then sell the entirety of the property to the developer and the money would be partinioned according to their financial interests int he warehouse. B. Gold Coins Carl would like to know if he has a right to own the gold coins, and that issue comes down to what type of finders law governs Carl's interest int he coins. Finders law can dictate who has a relative title to partinioned according to their financial interests int he warehouse. B. Gold Coins Carl would like to know if he has a right to own the gold coins, and that issue comes down to what type of finders law governs Carl's interest int he coins. Finders law can dictate who has a relative title to other's when property is either lost, abandoned, mislaid, embedded, or a treasure trove. When property is lost, like in Armory v. Delamirie, the property goes to the finder against all subsequent finders, and the first finder has the right to exclude others, good against the world, until the actual owner of the property is revealed and then has a right to their lost property. Once property is abandoned, the courts assume that the original owner does not want the property and longer, and it would go to waste, so the initial finder will receieve full property rights over it. The next three property rights are relevent to Carl's findings, because there is a possiblity based on the facts of who gets to keep them. The first, treasure trove, is a rule of finders law that awards hidden and ancient treasure to the finder, no matter whose land it was on. However, in Corliss v. Wenner, the court made it clear that treasure trove is not a doctrine that common law follows because it was not carried over from England when America was established and treasure trove encourages trespass and awards the trespasser, which is a perverse rule to follow and encourage. Also, almost every court in the US do not validate treasure trove as a finders law rule. The alternative rule in Corliss was the embedded rule, which awards the found ancient property to the owner of the property itself due to it being part of the natural earth, in an assumption that the owner has either passed away or is not coming back for it. Finally, there is mislaid property, which is awarded to the property owner as well until the original owner returns to claim title to it. Carl's fidning of the gold coins will likely either be treasure trove, embedded, or mislaid, however it is not likely, for reasons previously discussed, that the court would follow treasure trove, so it is either mislaid or embedded. For the property to be mislaid like in McAvoy v. Medina, it would have had to have been clear that the property was simply mislplaced, such as on a table or in a place that the property itself is normally placed, and then forgotten about by the owner. Alternativly, like in Benjamin v. Lindner, property can be tightly wrapped and placed in very odd places so as to conceal the property from others, and simply cannot be returned to the owner because of a difficulty of physically getting the property back. In Carl's case, the coins that were hidden in the base of the warehouse wall, that was so concealed that only his finger could pull out a mesh bag, would likely resemble Benjamin v. Lindner and the property that was mislaid by someone. Although the coins themselves were5 appraised and found to be from the late 1800's, the bag that they were wrapped in was a mesh bag from a grocery store in business 10 years prior, so clearly the coins were not placed in the warehouse in the late-1800's, if it even existed then. So with the wrapped and placed in very odd places so as to conceal the property from others, and simply cannot be returned to the owner because of a difficulty of physically getting the property back.

So with the coins being mislaid, that means that Carl shoudl have returned them to the property owners, Alex and Brock, as they had a duty to wait with the mislaid property for the owner to return to claim it, as well as the $20,000 that they are worth. Coat and Growler Carl also needs to know what his rights are regarding his coat and his growler, which each share a similar right, but are still debatebly seperate transactions. When voluntarily giving one's own property to another without transferring title of that property, a person sets up a bailment. The bailor is the person who voluntarily trusts their property to another, the baillee is the recieving party in a bailment that is expected to carry out some service, protection, or holding for the bailor. The bailee takes on a responability to provide such protection or service liek in Allen v. Hyatt, and are liable for damage or injury to the property once they have accepted the bailment terms. The terms are either expresselly made or impliedly made. An express bailment is a clear transfer of the property to another with verbal agreement, a document, or some other validating terms. an Implied bailment is one that is reasnoably recognizable by the parties involved with either the actions of the parties, the expectations of the property's handling, or small objects like tickets and signs that denote a bailment has occurred. Carl's growler that was his own property likely was a bailment transaction with the brewery because he was able to give them his property and receieve a claim ticket with a number attached to it that was copied onto his growler as well. By providing Carl with a claim ticket and coinciding numbers, and then taking the growler from him, an implied bailment was set up with Carl as the bailor and the brewery as the baillee. By then subsequently breaking it, the brewery breached their bailment duties to Carl and are liable for the the damages that Carl has recieved. The coat that Carl left at the brewery door is a different transaction however. The bailment that occurred when Carl put his coat on the hook was potentially a gratuitous bailment, which means that it could have 11 been a bailment transaction, but Carl did not still have to pay for anything. On one hand, Carl could argue that it was an implied contract again, and that the hooks by the front door should be reasonably expected to be monitered and protected by the the growler from him, an implied bailment was set up with Carl as the bailor and the brewery as the baillee. By then subsequently breaking it, the brewery breached their bailment duties to Carl and are liable for the the damages that Carl has recieved. The coat that Carl left at the brewery door is a different transaction however. The bailment that occurred when Carl put his coat on the hook was potentially a gratuitous bailment, which means that it could have still been a bailment transaction, but Carl did not have to pay for anything. On one hand, Carl could argue that it was an implied contract again, and that the hooks by the front door should be reasonably expected to be monitered and protected by the brewery. But on the other hand, the brewery can simply argue that they had no knwoledge of his coat going on the hook, and although it is expected that coats will go there, they have not indicated that they will protect the coat hooks in any way. It is likely then that there was no implied gratuitous bailment when Carl left his coat on the hooks near the door and the brewery is not liable for it's theft. C. David David's interests were conveyed to him under a grant from Alex, but the terms of the grant will decide what he is able to do with the land and if he still owns the interest after building a development with a mix of reidential untis and a ground floor commercial store. The grant that Alex conveys to David gives David a possessory estate in the 5 vacant acres of the land in fee simple subject to executory limitation. Alex's two sons Frank and Fred then have a future interest in executory interests. This is because Frank and Fred's interests can cut short David's interest, and it will then spring over to them in fee simple from David. The condition that Alex sets is a word of duration, which was argued in Marenholz v. School Country Board, but because the interest does not return to Alex with a possiblity of reverter, the interest goes to grantee's Frank and Fred. Specifically, the word ""only"" was argued in Marenholz, but once again, the interest created in the grantee makes David's interest fee simple subject to executory limitation. Because David has not yet begun to violate the agreement, due to the new buildings only being planned, the executory interests of Frank and Fred are not yet possessory estates. Once David decides to go ahead and violate the limitations placed on his interest, the proeprty immedietly become present possessory estates in fee simple absolute for both Frank and Fred, and David loses his title to the property. Alex retains nothing as his children will inheret the proeprty. Additionally, although the Rules against perpetuity to apply to the conveyance, Alex's children are also lives in being at the time of the deed, so they validate their own lives and the courts will be able to determine whether or not the interests vests. Because of this, the conveyance is valid under the RAP. the executory interests of Frank and Fred are not yet possessory estates.

Additionally, although the Rules against perpetuity to apply to the conveyance, Alex's children are also lives in being at the time of the deed, so they validate their own lives and the courts will be able to determine whether or not the interests vests. Because of this, the conveyance is valid under the RAP. Edward Edward's interests were conveyed to him for another 5 acres of the vacant lot, but his deed is a ambiguous and requires attention to the intention of Alex to decipher what interest Edwards retains after selling IPA's. In an ambiguous deed, the courts will avoid difficulty in deciphering between ambiguity like in Craigen, by looking at the constructive terms of a conveyance. By conveying to edward 5 acrs of land with the words ""so as long as"" it appears that Edward has a fee simple determinable with Alex retaining a possibility of reverter. However, the next clause then uses the word ""if"" so as so set a conditional word in the property interest as well, seemingly giving Edward a fee simple absolute subject to condition subsequent, and then a possibility of reverter to Alex. The courts would find that like the contradictory phrasing in Craigen, the favored interpretation of the deed would be the one that limits alienability. Due to this, the Court would find that Edward's interest would be in fee simple absolute subject to condition subsequent, because Alex's right of entry would have to be an action that Alex himself brings. If Alex chooses not to bring the action, then Edward is free to continue the brewery until he adversely possess' the property, but until then the courts would favor that outcome over Edward havinga fee simple determinable. It is also clar, like in Ford v. Allen by not naming the son as an interest holder, that Alex had intended on re entering the property to reclaim it if needed. The interest involved are also not a contingent remainder, an executory interest, or a vested remainder subject to partial divestment so the Rules against Perpetuity do not apply. "," Adverse Possession of Greenacre Lands The two interests involved are the current interests of Betty and now Debbie, who recieved the land from her father Chris. The issue is whether or not Debbie or Chris successfully adversely possesed their portion of Greenacre or if Betty has right to ouster them from the property. If Betty wants to ouster them from the property, then she needs to bring a claim of quiet title against Debbie in 2019. A claim of Question 2: Adverse Possession of Greenacre Lands The two interests involved are the current interests of Betty and now Debbie, who recieved the land from her father Chris. The issue is whether or not Debbie or Chris successfully adversely possesed their portion of Greenacre or if Betty has right to ouster them from the property. If Betty wants to ouster them from the property, then she needs to bring a claim of quiet title against Debbie in 2019. A claim of quiet title will remove the trespasser of one's property off the land, so as to ""quiet"" their voidable title to the land. However, for Betty to do so, Debbie and Chris need to not have already adversely possessed the land. To have adversely possessed the land, Chris and Debbie would have had to mee tthe five requirements of Adverse Possession: continuous, actual, exclusive, open/notorious, and hostile. Simultanesouly, they need to have met the Statute of Limitations requirement of possession of 10 years, and be able to tack on Chris' possession to Debbie's. To be continuous, the AP must run through the statute of limitations of ten years with continued use of the land in a way that an owner of that land would use over that time. Like in Tieu v. Morgan when land was being used as a daycare, that AP land was still used by Tieu in a way that resembled how one would go about possessing that land. Additonally, like in Tieu, the time can be ""tacked"" on between Adverse Possessors if both possessors are in privity with one another. This means that they had to have an affirmative agreement on the terms of the property being possessed when they transferred land to one another. Even though Chris only used the home for about 8 weeks a year, he dis use it regularly for relaxtion which is expected of a summmer home that an owner would visit for 2 months out of a year. Debbie and Chris were in privity because of his conveyance to her so their AP was continuous. To be actual, their AP must have been actually used in a reasonable way that an owner would use that land. Chris used it as a summer home and Debbie used it as an actual home for herself to live with a garden. They both made imporvements ont he house and enjoyed the benefits of the outdoors there, so they were in actual use of the property. For the AP to be exclusive, the use must have been exclusive not only to strangers, but specifically exclusive from the actual owner of the land. Because Betty never even travelled over into the area, and didn't know about their livilhood there, the AP was exclusive. The people that came by to enjoy the grounds were simply guests of the adverse possessors and like in Pimental v. Medros when the family woudl have guests over for a fire and to enjoy their patio, Debbie and Chris alloed others to do so.To be open/ notorious like in Marengo v. Cave, the adverse possessor must be able to give actual and constructive notice to the owner so much so that that the owner of the property would reasonably know they are occupying it. In Marengo, they also require a ""visibility"" aspect, which is fully available to Betty if she were to travel over there, but she just never did. Additionally, people came through their hunting didn't know about their livilhood there, the AP was exclusive. The people that came by to enjoy the grounds were simply guests of the adverse possessors and like in Pimental v. Medros when the family woudl have guests over for a fire and to enjoy their patio, Debbie and Chris alloed others to do so.To be open/ notorious like in Marengo v. Cave, the adverse possessor must be able to give actual and constructive notice to the owner so much so that that the owner of the property would reasonably know they are occupying it. In Marengo, they also require a ""visibility"" aspect, which is fully available to Betty if she were to travel over there, but she just never did. Additionally, people came through their hunting ground regularly and this could have reasonably gottent around to Betty. Although the land is expansive, it can still be expected that Betty should have been able to know about this land that Chris and Debbie occupied. Finally, hostility requirements vary from state to state. Most states use an objective standard of hostility like in Manillo v. Gorski, where the intent of the AP is not necessary. WHat is needed is a manifestation of the use of the land. Only minor encroachments need actual notice of hostile AP. The subjective intent is then used in a minoruty of states, but stpecifically, in Maine Dombowski is used as a ""bad faith"" standard, inw hich mistake of law is not enough to hostily posses. If New Suffolk used this test, Debbie and Chris would fail the hostility requirmenet because they were on the land under a good faith mistake, which is the subjective intent needed in Oregon in Tieu v. Morgan. So unless there was a Maine subjective standard of bad faith to be met in Greenacre, Debbie and Chris were objectively manifesting their usage of the land as AP, either under good faith mistake or as good faith purchasers of a color of title. They then would likely qualify as adverse possessors of Greenacre land. (running out of time) Color of Title Once Adverse possession is sorted out, the original transfer title, which was a defective title due to the fraudlent actions of Andrew forging Betty's signature, needed to have been bought in good faith so that Chris and Debbie can get their land that they use. Because Betty lives on the land with them still, a color of title transfer would not entitle Debbie to the entirety of the land, just what they use. Like in Wetherbee when a man gets the title the title to provide improvements to the trees under a color of title, Debbie gets the land that she uses 2 acres outside of he rhome because that is what she uses. Tenancy by the entirety Betty and Andrew were tenants by the entirerty so if he wanted to actually sever their title, they would need to get divorced. They did not, like in US v Craft where the couple stayed to together, Andrew simply waited until he died. Death, divorce, or murder of the other occupant would sever to title to tenancy by the entirety, but the only difference between joint tenancy and the current case, is that Betty the land that she uses 2 acres outside of he rhome because that is what she uses. Tenancy by the entirety Betty and Andrew were tenants by the entirerty so if he wanted to actually sever their title, they would need to get divorced. They did not, like in US v Craft where the couple stayed to together, Andrew simply waited until he died. Death, divorce, or murder of the other occupant would sever to title to tenancy by the entirety, but the only difference between joint tenancy and the current case, is that Betty and Andrew could not unilaterally sever the title, they are treated as one person and would have to sever their cotenancy as one entity. They did not do so, but that does not ruin Andrew's color of title, it's stil defective. ",716,2772,1330

Connor and Carla's vested remainders subject to complete divestment of a life estate, fall under the Rule Against Perpetuities, but are valid since they were both ascertainable at the time of conveyance. "," 1a. The issue is to discuss the nature of Brock and Alex's property interests. Since Alex, the grantor, created a deed conveying the property to both himself and Brock ""to hold jointly as tennants in common"", Alex and Brock are tennants in common, meaning they enjoy equal, free use of the property as a whole, regardless of how the shares are divided. In order for Brock to ""make some money from this developer"", he has 2 options. First, he has the option to petition for sale, which would allow the court to appraise the value of the land as a whole and sell it. This would be convenient for both Alex and Brock, since the money would go directly to them porportionate to their original shares. Brock's second option is to convey his shares to the buyer. This would grant the buyer full use of the land and they would become tennants in common with Alex. Brock however, would no longer have his shares. 1b. The first issue is identifying who has the biggest claim to ownership of the gold coins. The coins were located, by Carl, in a hole in the warehouse wall and were contained in a plastic bag with the name of a local grocery store, that had opened 10 years 2earlier, on it. Similarly to the Benjamin case, where money was found hidden in the wing of an old airplane, it is reasonable to assume that the true owner of the coins hid them in the wall with the intent to come back. This would classify the coins as mislaid 1b. The first issue is identifying who has the biggest claim to ownership of the gold coins. The coins were located, by Carl, in a hole in the warehouse wall and were contained in a plastic bag with the name of a local grocery store, that had opened 10 years earlier, on it. Similarly to the Benjamin case, where money was found hidden in the wing of an old airplane, it is reasonable to assume that the true owner of the coins hid them in the wall with the intent to come back. This would classify the coins as mislaid property. In the Benjamin case, it was decided that the bank (aka the locus owner), which has just recently bought the land the plane was found on, had the strongest claim to the money. Following the ruling of that case, the coin do not belong to Carl, the coins belong to the current owner(s) of the property, Alex and Brock. Alex and Brock would have an undisputable claim against everyone, except for the true owner of the coins. The next issue is to identify Carl's rights to his growler. If the growler is not broken and was either mislaid somewhere in the warehouse or stolen, Carl has the strongest claim to it. However, his claim is not the strongest. Since the growler was a gift, the friend that gifted him the growler is the true owner and has the strongest claim. If the friend that gifted the growler ""abandoned"" it with Carl and made no effort in getting it back, then Carl would have the strongest claim. Additionally, if Carl does not make an effort to relocated the growler and someone else has possession (via stealing or finding) of it, Carl may lose his claim. However, if the growler was not stolen and is actually still in the warehouse, then the warehouse has a claim to it until Carl retrieves it. Carl's jacket is similar in that if it was mislaid, the warehouse has the next strongest claim until Carl comes to repossess it. If it was stolen, Carl remains the true owner. 1c. The issue is to identify the involved parties' present estates and future interests as they pertain to each division of the property. In the seciton that went to David Developer, David originally had a present possessory fee simple defeasible determinable, Frank and Fred had an executory interest in fee simple, and Alex had a possibility of reverter. David's plan to use the property for both residential purposes and commercial stores violates the terms of his deed. If he were to go through with his plan, according to the deed, David would no longer have any interest in the property, and the present possessory interest would transfer to Frank and Fred, whom would both have possessory fee simple absolutes. In the seciton that was sold to Edward Elixir, Edward has a present possessory fee simple defeasible simple, and Alex had a possibility of reverter. David's plan to use the property for both residential purposes and commercial stores violates the terms of his deed. If he were to go through with his plan, according to the deed, David would no longer have any interest in the property, and the present possessory interest would transfer to Frank and Fred, whom would both have possessory fee simple absolutes. In the seciton that was sold to Edward Elixir, Edward has a present possessory fee simple defeasible determinable as well, his heirs have a vested remainder subject to complete divestment in a fee simple, and Alex has a reversion with a right to re-entry. Edward violated his deed with Alex when he began making IPAs on the property. In the deed, the condition given was that if IPAs were ever made on the property, Alex would have the right to reclaim the premises. When Edward began making IPAs on the property, Alex gained the right to re-enter and that 5-acre section of the property transfered back to him automatically. "," The issue is identifying who has the stronger claim to Greenacre. To have an adverse possession (AP) claim, one must meet all the requirements under AP: continuous, hostile, open and notorious, exclusive, and in good or bad faith. Debbie can aruge that she and her father have adversely possessed the property under good faith and color of title. Chris did not know that Andrew forged Betty's signature, and left the property to his daughter under the impression that the estate was truly his. Assuming the statute of limitations is 10 years, Chris only adversely possessed the land for 8 years and was only there for 8 weeks per year, so he did not meet the time requirement for use of the land. Debbie has lived on the land full time from 2011-2019; was there in good faith; had exclusive rights to 2 acres but allowed neighbors to use the rest of the land in the way it always has been used; and her use of the property was open and notorious as shown by her building a new house on the property, interacting with the neighbors and allowing them on the land. Betty can argue that she purchased the 50 acre property with her husband, Andrew, as Tenants by the area, Andrew did frequently, fulfilling their use of Entirety, and although she never personally visited4the the property. Betty can argue that she did not sign Greenacre over to Chris, and that her signature was forged by her deceased husband. Betty can also point out that Debbie has not met the time requirement acres but allowed neighbors to use the rest of the land in the way it always has been used; and her use of the property was open and notorious as shown by her building a new house on the property, interacting with the neighbors and allowing them on the land. Betty can argue that she purchased the 50 acre property with her husband, Andrew, as Tenants by the Entirety, and although she never personally visited the area, Andrew did frequently, fulfilling their use of the property. Betty can argue that she did not sign Greenacre over to Chris, and that her signature was forged by her deceased husband. Betty can also point out that Debbie has not met the time requirement for AP, and therefore has no claim to the land. However, through color or title, Debbie can adversley possess the 2 acres that she routinely uses, while the rest of the property is repossessed by Betty. ",131,931,419
354b8e2c-ce96-49fc-8a7b-80c7b8f04be3," Future and Present Interests in Oliver's Grant Oliver is the grantor. Oliver's children, Connor and Carla, have a life interest subsequent determinable. While his children are both alive and working full time, we do not know if either of them will retire within 21 years. Due to the inability to know if any of his children will retire with 21 years this violates Rules against Perpetuity (RAP) when applying the Rule of Convenience (RAC) and is void. Olver's nephew, Robert, has a life estate. Oliver's grandchild, Victor has a vested remainder subject to partial divestment in fee simple. Victor is vested remainder because he is 26 years old and has already reached the age of 25. It is subject to partial divestment because the fee simple shared by all of Oliver's grandchildren that reach the age of 25. Oliver's grandchild, Vivian, as well as all of Oliver's unborn grandchildren, have an executory interest in fee simple. They have an executor interest in fee simple because they are a third party to Victor who is already vested, and will assume the same interest as Victor if and when they reach the age of 25. Potential Violation of RAC Upon Robert's Death At the present time the unborn grandchildren do not yet violate RAC because Robert has a life estate. However, as soon as Robert dies his life estate is passed on to any of Oliver's grandchildren that reach the age of 25 as a fee simple subject to partial divestment and any that are between the ages of 4 and 24 will have an executor interest. Any of Oliver's grandchildren that are not yet the age of 4 when Robert dies, will not be able to reach the age of 25 with the 21 years required in RAC and their interest(s) will be void.

Rewrite of of Oliver's Grant after removing RAC voided language Oliver grants his poperty ""to Robert for life, then to my garndchildren who reach the age of 25 within 21 years of Robert's death."" "," Alex purchased the 10 acres of land and warehouse in 2000. In 2003 Brock paid his brother Alex a sum of money for half of the business and half of the warehouse site. In exchange, Alex signed a deed that states that he granted the land to himself and and Brock to hold jointly as tenants in common. The deed Alex signed makes Brock and Alex Tenants in Common with an even interest in the property, but as tenenats in common they each have full rights of usage and exclusion of the property except against each other. As a tenent in common Brock has the right to sell his share of of his interest. However, should he sell his share of the interest in the tenancy in common, so long as the sale does not hurt the finacial value of Alex's share. If the developer purchased Brock's share with an agreement to not change the usage or look of the property without Alex's consent then there will likely be no issue. However, the developer's stated intention is to purchase the land and develop it into condos. Alex can then sue Brock to stop the sale due to the developers plans becuase it would impair his ability to coniue to use his property to his personal benefit by impacting the businesses that Alex is operating on the property. Courts have decided that a prior existing business has the right to coniue to exist and operate and not be impeded due to the sale of the interest of a joint tenent in common. Alex will undoubtedly make the claim that such as sale would cause just that. However, Brock will be able to argue that as tenants in common Alex does not have the right to impair Brocks ability to earn a return on his investment and the purchase price of 2 million is a substantial return on investment and Alex does not have the right to prevent Brock from selling his percentage and make the return on investment. Should this case go to trial the court can decide to approve the sale of the entire 10 acres to the developers bvecuase Brock would like to sell his portion and has a right to make a retunr an investment thus forcing Alex to sell his interests as well. Additionally the court may decide that the usage the Brocks ability to earn a return on his investment and the purchase price of 2 million is a substantial return on investment and Alex does not have the right to prevent Brock from selling his percentage and make the return on investment. Should this case go to trial the court can decide to approve the sale of the entire 10 acres to the developers bvecuase Brock would like to sell his portion and has a right to make a retunr an investment thus forcing Alex to sell his interests as well. Additionally the court may decide that the usage the developer has planned for the land has a greater public benefit due to the growing population in New Boston and the public need for housing. Additionally, the developers plans fit the reality of the neighborhodd currently as there have recently been new conos built. The court can also decide that Alex has been using the site to generate income since 2001 and had invested $500, his own money and converted a 10 acre land that only had an old warehouse on the property into a thriving business that provides residents of New Boston and place they can visit for enjoy, which did not exist before Alex. Additionlaly the court can decide that it was Alex's investments that made the property itself valuable and the neighborhood around the site valuable and desirable. In deciding that the court can decide that it was ALex and not Brock who is mostly responsible for the increase in value and thus should not be forced to sell becuase of his own efforts to increase the value. Lastly, the court may decided to split the land evenly and fairly so that Brock can sell his share to the developer and Alex can remain and coniue to run his business on the site the courts can decide to evenly split the land. However, should the court decide this route it will be forced to evenly split the land in half, but will attempt to make sure it is split in a way that Alex is left with a portion that has a 1 milion dollar value and the deveolper recieve a portion worth one million dollars. If the court does not do this then it is possible to split the land in half for the sale but leave Alex and Brock with share that are not equal in value. Based on the based cases and weighing of all of the factors I believe the court will choose the latter offer, as the court will shy away from void to right to transfer from Brock and forcing Alex to sell his interest against his will. "," A ) Carl can claim a superior ownership of the gold coins due to treasure trove. Carl would argue that the original owner hid the coins, they were discoverable and becuase Carl found them he has a supriors right to the coins over everyone but the rightful owner. He would also argue that due to the coins being gold coins from the late 1800's worth $20,000, they are clearly treasure and there is no denying he found them. Alex and Brock will likely argue that the coins were found on private property and were intetionally left behind by the rightful owner so they have a superior right to the coins. Brock's counter argument to that will be that the coins were hidden by their rightful owner at least 10 years prior due to the bag in which they were found being a bag from a store that was on the site ten year ago, before Alex or Brock had any ownershipo rights of the property, and therefore he can continue to argue treasure and argue that even id it was intentionlly place there and left behind and not hidden ALex and Brock were not the owners of the property when that act occurred and Carl has asuperior right right over ALex and Brock. Additionally he is currently in possesion of the coins which he will argues adds credence to his claim to having the superior right as the finder and the person currently in possesion. I believe the court will find in Carl's favor after weighing the totality of the factors. 1) they are gold coins from the 1800's woth $20,000 2) they were found under a floor board which would lead to a reasonable inference that they were hidden and not intentionally placed and left behind 3) he is currently in possesion of the coins 4) there were there for at least 10 years and were not seen or found by Alex or Brock which support they were hidden and not misplaced. B) As for his growler, he has a strong arugument 5under bailment that the bussiness took possesion of the growler and was responsible for its safe keeping. He gave the growler directly to an empoyee, they then gave him a ticke to retrieve it, they that an employee broke it, and it was in fact destroyed on their 4) there were there for at least 10 years and were not seen or found by Alex or Brock which support they were hidden and not misplaced. B) As for his growler, he has a strong arugument under bailment that the bussiness took possesion of the growler and was responsible for its safe keeping. He gave the growler directly to an empoyee, they then gave him a ticke to retrieve it, they that an employee broke it, and it was in fact destroyed on their watch without Carls's consent. The bussiness will argue that while they provided the service of holding the growler they did not make any explicit promise fo its safe keeping and Carl left it with them at his own risk. The court will likely find in Carl's favor on the issue of the growler after weighing the totalitty of the eveidence and based on case law that found a the owners of a parking lot reposible for losing a car after the owner of the car directly gave the keys to the car to the parking lot attendent. In that case the court found against the parking lot. Carl's case is simmilar to that case As for the coat, Carl's argument is not as strong. He did not give it to an employee, he left it unattended on a hook by the exit door. He cannot have reasonably assume that the bussiness was watching his jacket nor that they led him to believe they would. This is similar to a case agains a parking lot where the owner of the car parked it in a lot that did not have an attendant on duty. His car was stolen and he sued the parking lot. THe court found against because there was no attempt to intention by the parking lot to have the car owner believe they were agreeing to watch his car. Due to the facts in Carl's case and the court ruling, I believe the court will find in favor of the bussiness. C) Alex has a fee simple absolute. David purchaes 5 acres from Alex as a fee simple determinable. THe condition is that the porperty has to allways be residential. Due to the fee simple determinable the property automatically goes back to Alex as a fee simple absolute once they violate the condition.. His two sons do not have any interest because a fee simple determinable can only be a reversion to the grantor. The 5 acres witht the bussinesses on them is a fee simple absolute that Alex conveys to Edwars as a fee simple subject to conditon due to the condition that it8mmust continue to not serve ipa. Once they begin serving ipas Alex must re enter and take action to take the property, like an eviction, to regain ownership. If he takes no action Edward keeps the property grantor.

But only for the two acres arounf the house because she did not behave as an owner by excluding other from the rest of the property. Betty would argue that she was as rightful owner and it was fraud that caused her to lose it. COurt will likely decided she still did not behave as an owner, thus lost it to Debbie Debbie has a claim to the everything but the 2 acres Betty did use as an owner would and under the vbelief she owned it. Betty will argue Debbie never used it and other used it becuase she allowed it. Court will likely decided she did not meet all of the factos of advers possesion and grant everyhting but the 2 acres to Betty. Sorry, I ran out of time ",371,842,1099
e8c7236a-2cae-40ea-8d17-5405ce4a0e0f," Rule agaisnt Perpetuites (RAP) has been around for a long time in order to limit the ability of a grantor to control property in the future. Such control can restrict a grantee from alienating property. RAP applies to 4 interests: contingent remainders, vested reaminder subject to an open class, executory interests, and options in contracts, which all have to vest or fail within 21 years within a life in being. The three elements of RAP are creation: whether the grant was created through a will or deed, validating life: someone who was alive at the time of the creation of the grant whose lifetime plus 21 years an interest has to either vest or fail, and vesting: which is then the interest either vests, is ready to take possession, or fails. In this case, Oliver has a reversion in fee simple. ""To the first of my children to retire, for life,"" is a contingent reaminder in a life estate. It is contingent because a condition (being the first one to retire) has to occur for one of Oliver's children to take property, and this condition may or may not occur. Therefore, both Carla and Connor have a contingent remainder in a life estate because they both have to satisfy the condition of being retired to take the property. ""Then to my nephew Robert for life,"" is just a vested reaminder in a life estate because the individual who is being granted the property, Robert is known, and he does not have to sastify a condition to take the property, instead Robert just has to wait for Oliver's children to retire and then die (assuming the children's interest is valid under RAP). Next, Oliver writes, ""then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25."" This interest is a contingent remainder in fee simple. Since the grandchildren are alive, Victor, who is 26, and has satisfied the condition (to be 25) to get the property when Robert dies, has a vested remainder in fee simple subject to open because his other siblings will also be able to take the property when they turn 25. Vivian, on the other hand, has an executory interest in fee simple. RAP does not apply to Oliver's reversion or Robert's vested remainder in a life etstate. However, RAP does apply to the contingent remainder of both Connor and Carla. The contingent remainder for both children would be void under RAP because there is a possibility that the interest could vest beyond 21 years of a life in being. For example, if both Connor and Carla died, and Oliver had another child (Z) condition (to be 25) to get the property when Robert dies, has a vested remainder in fee simple subject to open because his other siblings will also be able to take the property when they turn 25. Vivian, on the other hand, has an executory interest in fee simple. RAP does not apply to Oliver's reversion or Robert's vested remainder in a life etstate. However, RAP does apply to the contingent remainder of both Connor and Carla. The contingent remainder for both children would be void under RAP because there is a possibility that the interest could vest beyond 21 years of a life in being. For example, if both Connor and Carla died, and Oliver had another child (Z) and then immediatley died right after, that child would not be a validating measure of life. Therefore, Z could take more than 21 years after the deaths of Carla, Connor, and Oliver, to get a job and then retire, making this contingent reaminder void. Victor's vested reaminder in fee simple subject to open and Vivian's executory interest is also void under RAP. Both are void because they both could die, and then Carla or Connor could have another child (T), and then Carla and Connor immedialtey die after, as well as Oliver. It would then take T more than 21 years after all the validating lives (Victor, Vivian, Connor, Carla, & Oliver) die to turn 25. SInce T was born after after the grant, he/she is not a validating life. The rule of convenience could only work in Victor's favor because he already met the condition of turning 26, therefore the class would close, however, any child born at the time such as Vivian, would get the property as well when she turns 25, however no child born after the grant would get the property. "," 1(a)I would first explain to Brock that even though his brother Alex, signed a deed that stated ""I, Alex Apple hereby grant this land to myself and my brother Brock to hold jointly as tenants in common,"" this deed does not form a joint tenancy, instead it creates a tenancy is common. In order for one to form a joint tenancy in a deed, they have to clear and precise language that shows they are in a joint tenancy, such as saying ""to hold as joint tennants, with right of suvivorship."" Therefore, when a deed is ambigous, the court well declare the interests shared are interests in it a tenancy in common. This could also not be a joint tenancy because the element of ""time,"" which is needed to create a joint tenancy is not satisfied because Alex accquired the land two years before Brock moved. In order for time to be satisifed in a joint tenancy, both tenants have to accquire the interest or property at the same time, which did not happen in this case. Furthermore, even though Alex was ambigous by writing ""Jointly as tenants"" he did write ""in common"" afterwards, which could show that he did in fact mean tenants in common. ambigous, the court well declare the interests shared are interests in it a tenancy in common. This could also not be a joint tenancy because the element of ""time,"" which is needed to create a joint tenancy is not satisfied because Alex accquired the land two years before Brock moved. In order for time to be satisifed in a joint tenancy, both tenants have to accquire the interest or property at the same time, which did not happen in this case. Furthermore, even though Alex was ambigous by writing ""Jointly as tenants"" he did write ""in common"" afterwards, which could show that he did in fact mean tenants in common. Since Brock and Alex are not in a joint tenancy, they both own undivided fractional parts of the property. This means that since Brock payed for half the bussiness and half the warehouse site, that has the right to sell his part of the warehouse site that he bought to the real estate developer. In order to sell his part of the land, Brock would have to request a partition by sale. I would advise Brock to tallk to his brother again about selling the property to the real estate developer, but if Alex does not change his mind, then I would tell Brock to request a partion by sale the court. A partion by kind would not work here because there it is not practicable for Brock to only sell half of the warehouse to the real estate developer to build condos. Even though courts prefer a partition in kind over a partition by sale, courts will choose to adminster a partition by sale if the physical attributes of the property make it impraticable and unequitable to use a partition by kind as well as if the owners' interests would be more promoted if a partition by sale were to happen (Delfino v. Valencias). Here, Brock would uilmatley argue that because he is an owner of half the property, and it is physically impossible and unequitable to split up a warehouse, that there should be a parition by sale. Brock could also argue that he and his brother Alex interests would be promoted and benefitted because the real estate developer is offering to buy the property for much more than it is worth, and Alex could buy land that is not that far away from the warehouse to move the brewery there and walk away, with a good chunk of money left over, which would also be a reason way to sell the land through a partition by sale. However, Alex could argue that it is not fair to him to give up a brewery he orginally bought on his own, and to have to move after 5 years of already doing well in the business. Alex could also argue that he would face prejudice in this sale because he is emotionally invested in his brewery and it has always been a dream of his to make beer and be sucessful. However, Brock could argue that he could still live his dream of owning a brewery by taking money from the sale and making another brewery on another piece of property. 1(b) Carl could be allowed to keep the coins if he could make a strong agrument that they were treasure trove because somone intentioanlly wrapped them up a long time ago (late-1800s) and are propbably beer and be sucessful. However, Brock could argue that he could still live his dream of owning a brewery by taking money from the sale and making another brewery on another piece of property. 1(b) Carl could be allowed to keep the coins if he could make a strong agrument that they were treasure trove because somone intentioanlly wrapped them up a long time ago (late-1800s) and are propbably dead by now so he should be able to keep them. However, the warehouse owners could argue that Carl should not be allowed to keep the coins because they would be considered mislaid property. When a rightful owner intentionally places property somewhere but forgets/over looks it, the rightful owner has a right to claim their property if they come back for it, if not it goes the owner of wherever the property was stored. In McAvoy v. Medina, a woman intentionally placed her purse on a table at a barbershop and forgot to take it with her when she left. The court claimed this property as mislaid and stated that if the rightful owner does not come back to pick up mislaid property, then the owner of the facility where the property was left has a right to keep it. In this case, Carl found the coins in a small hole at the base of the warehouse, therefore, the coins should be given to Brock and Alex who own the warehouse. Even if Carl argued that the person who put the coins in the hole did not have the intention on coming back because they could have been stolen and since they are from the late-1800s the person who put them there was dead, it is still considered mislaid property. In Benjamin, $18,000 was found in the side panel of a plane. That money could have been hidden for criminal reasons but the court still ruled it as mislaid property, and the owner of the plane, the bank, was entited to that money. Overall, a court would probably grant the coins as mislaid property. Carl could sue the bar for breaking his growler because there was a bailment relatinship. A bailment is when a property is entrusted by the owner to the possessor. In this case, Carl trusted the bartender with his growler. Carl could argue that because he was given a claim ticket when he brought the growler in and knew that he had to show the ticket to pick it up, that he was under the impression that the bartender was going to take care of it and not let it get stolen or broken, and if either happened, they were liable to compensate Carl's loss. The bartender could argue that these was no bailment relastionship because just because Carl was given a claim ticket, did not mean the bartender or bar would be responsible if anything were to happen to it. However, Carl could then argue that the claimt ticket never said anything about the bar not being responsible for lost items (Allen v. Hyatt). However, it is most likely that the a court would find a bialment relationship between Carl and the bar. Laslty, Carl would not be able to hold the bar accountable for his lost jacket because he hung it up on a public hook in a public place, therefore he is in charge of keeping his jacket safe, not the bar. were liable to compensate Carl's loss. The bartender could argue that these was no bailment relastionship because just because Carl was given a claim ticket, did not mean the bartender or bar would be responsible if anything were to happen to it.

Laslty, Carl would not be able to hold the bar accountable for his lost jacket because he hung it up on a public hook in a public place, therefore he is in charge of keeping his jacket safe, not the bar. 1(c) Alex has a right too renter and claim the premises from Edwards because he has a possibilty of reverter and Edward has a fee simple determindable However, courts are more likely to use the lang. in the deed Alex wrote to Edwards as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because courts do not like that a property owner can lose their property when they have a fee simple determinable in the case of Fee simple subject to condition subsequent, a grantor has a right of entry and has to actually "," Betty will first make the legal claim that since she and her husband were in a tenancy by entirey, that he could not sell the land to Debbie's dad without her permisson. Therefore, Betty will argue that Debbie should not have ownership of the land becasue her father was given it illegally since she never mutally agreed with her husband that he could sell it. Debbier could argue that even if her father was given the land in a wrongful way, that she has possession of the property through adverse poessession. In order to gain possession through adverese possession, one must satisfy the statue of limitations and five elements that have to be met. The five elements are continous, an adverese possessor (AP) must use the property without interuptions. Actual, the AP must physically be there. Hostile, the AP must be acting without the legal owner's permisson to be there. Notorious/open, the AP must use the property in a manner that is suffcient for the actual legal owner to have actual or constructive notice that their property is being used (Margeno Cave) and exclsuive, the AP must act like the property is theirs by excluding strangers. Here, Debbie could argue that the SOL was satisifed by tacking on the years her father was there possessing and using the land to possession, one must satisfy the statue of limitations and five elements that have to be met. The five elements are continous, an adverese possessor (AP) must use the property without interuptions. Actual, the AP must physically be there. Hostile, the AP must be acting without the legal owner's permisson to be there. Notorious/open, the AP must use the property in a manner that is suffcient for the actual legal owner to have actual or constructive notice that their property is being used (Margeno Cave) and exclsuive, the AP must act like the property is theirs by excluding strangers. Here, Debbie could argue that the SOL was satisifed by tacking on the years her father was there possessing and using the land to satisdy advere possession (which was 8 years) and through privity, which is when a prior property owner voluntairly gives the property to the present owner, Debbie satisifes SOL because she has been there since 2011-2019, therefore SOL is satisifed because it has been over ten years. However, Betty could argue that SOL was not satisfied because even though Debbier's dad used and possesed the land for 8 years, the use of the land was not continous because Debbie was given the property in 2009 when her dad died but did not move until 2011. For continous possesson, Debbie could say that through her father, there was continous possession: because he was their eight weeks a year which was fisihing season, (which is when he could only use the cabin) and so was Debbie when she moved Actual possesion: because her father was physically there on the property every year duirng fishing season, and Debbie was there full time Hostile possesion: because her father did not possess the land through the permission of Betty nor did Debbie Open/Notorious: because people from the town knew that Debbie and her father owned it Excuslive: because people had to ask permisson to use the property when both Debbie and her Father possessed it Betty could argue Not Continous because Debbie did not move until two years later to the cabin Not actual because Debbie's father was only there eight weeks a year and it took Debbie two years to miove Not Hostile: because there was no way Betty could have known her husband sold her property, and therefore, she could argue bad faith of both Chris and Debbie because they should have known they were obtatining property illegally Not open/nortious: because there was no way for Betty to know her property was sold or that it was being used Not actual because Debbie's father was only there eight weeks a year and it took Debbie two years to miove Not Hostile: because there was no way Betty could have known her husband sold her property, and therefore, she could argue bad faith of both Chris and Debbie because they should have known they were obtatining property illegally Not open/nortious: because there was no way for Betty to know her property was sold or that it was being used Not exclusive: because Debbie at times allowed people to be on the property without her permission ",741,1558,742

The will then becomes ""To the first of my children to reture, for life, then to my nephew Robert for life"" and so in the end, Oliver Owner has a reversion in fee simple absolute since he is still alive. 2) "," 1A: The issue at hand is what property interest he has and how this allows him to utilize his right to sell. Brock holds a tenancy in common for the brewery and the 10 acres of land, which gives him the right to use the proprety, obtain any profit made from the property, and right to transfer the property (note: i know theres a fourth right but i can't remember it). He, however, has no right to survivorship in the property, meaning upon his death or his brothers, 2the other cannot have full ownership and his share in the tenancy in common will be passed down to any heirs. The issue at hand is what property interest he has and how this allows him to utilize his right to sell. Brock holds a tenancy in common for the brewery and the 10 acres of land, which gives him the right to use the proprety, obtain any profit made from the property, and right to transfer the property (note: i know theres a fourth right but i can't remember it). He, however, has no right to survivorship in the property, meaning upon his death or his brothers, the other cannot have full ownership and his share in the tenancy in common will be passed down to any heirs. The main option Brock has is to put the land up for a partition in either sale or kind (Delfino v Vealancis). Courts, however, prefer to do a partition in kind. In this case, you will each be given a part of the land in question and you were no longer be tenants in common, you will each have your own interest in the land. It will be highly unlikely for the court to grant a partition in sale, because the brother operates a successful brewery business on the land and thus, the partition in kind will keep his part of the land where the business is laid mostly, and, if it is larger than your portion, you could be subject to an owelty, meaning, you would get money to keep the shares equal. Furthermore, since it is simply a warehouse and not, for example, an apartment building, it would be easier to do a partition in kind. What Brock may do is transfer his title to the developer, thus, making the developer and Alex tenants in common, therefore receiving some money from the developer. 1B: Dear Carl Cask, I have put together the following information to discuss your rights to the coins you have found, and what you can do about your growler and your coat. The first issue discussed is if you have the right of finders towards the coins and thus has a possessory claim over them. Property that has been separated from the true and rightful owner can be categoried as either abandoned, mislaid, lost, embedded, or treasure trove. Abandoned property is property that has been voluntarily let go of by the owner and thus the owner has relinquished all claims of title to the property. Mislaid property is when the rightful owner had placed something with the intent to return to it and take it back, but has forgotten. In the case of mislaid property, the owner of the property in which the item has been mislaid has the claim to possession over it, for example, a pocketbook that was placed on a tabletop of a shop by the owner voluntarily and then left there is now the property of the shop. (McAvoy v Medina). Lost property is when the owner had involuntarily left something, such as, a either abandoned, mislaid, lost, embedded, or treasure trove. Abandoned property is property that has been voluntarily let go of by the owner and thus the owner has relinquished all claims of title to the property. Mislaid property is when the rightful owner had placed something with the intent to return to it and take it back, but has forgotten. In the case of mislaid property, the owner of the property in which the item has been mislaid has the claim to possession over it, for example, a pocketbook that was placed on a tabletop of a shop by the owner voluntarily and then left there is now the property of the shop. (McAvoy v Medina). Lost property is when the owner had involuntarily left something, such as, a jewel that was left on the floor (Armory v Delamirie) and thus it is subject to the law of finders, where the initial finder has the strongest title over all subsequent finders, except for the true and rightful owner, if the owner is found. Embedded property is property that has become one with the earth, and so it is owned by the owner of property in which it was found. Treasure trove is property that was also left in the ground, perhaps with the original owners goal to keep it protected and return to it, however, it was never reclaimed. It is owned by the person who owns the property in which the treasure trove is found, and the original owner is likely to be thought to be dead or impossible to find due to the age of the treasure trove. Treasure trove is not used in the common law because it would give people the incentive to search for ""hidden treasure"" in the ground and thus, encourage trespass (Korliss v Wenner). Although the age of the coins that you have found in the brewery would indicate that the original owner is definitely dead, the fact that they were inside of a mesh shopping bag with the brand of a grocery store that had only opened 10 years prior would indicate that the owner may possibly be alive. Although fitting the best under the category of treasure trove due to the antiquity of the coins, the common law has expressed dislike towards categorizing property as treasure trove because it promotes people to trespass. It is also unlikely to be categorized as mislaid because Carl found the coins inside of a hole in the wall of a warehouse, it would be unreasonable for someone to go through such substanial effort to place their property inside of that hole and then forget about it for a period of time, unlike in McAvoy v Medina, where it was easy for the owner of the pocketbook to simply place it on a table and forget. Possibly, the coins can be categorized as lost if they were dropped on the floor and no longer found, and then the warehouse went through construction, and thus it was lost into the wall. It is also unlikely to be classified as embedded because of the fact of the mesh bag being from a store that opened approximately 10 years ago, thus, it hasnt become a part of the earth through a long period of time, as, for example, pottery would be (Korliss v Wenner).It is unlikely to be classified as abandoned because of the condition in which the coins were found, i.e. in a mesh bag with branding on it. However, the owner could still have intended to abandon the coins even 8 though he put them inside of a mesh bag. The issue that you hope to resolve closely resembles the issue in Korliss v Wenner. The gold coins in to be classified as embedded because of the fact of the mesh bag being from a store that opened approximately 10 years ago, thus, it hasnt become a part of the earth through a long period of time, as, for example, pottery would be (Korliss v Wenner).It is unlikely to be classified as abandoned because of the condition in which the coins were found, i.e. in a mesh bag with branding on it. However, the owner could still have intended to abandon the coins even though he put them inside of a mesh bag. The issue that you hope to resolve closely resembles the issue in Korliss v Wenner. The gold coins in Korliss ultimately were the property of the owner of the land in which they were found, therefore, you likely are to have no claim towards the gold coins. However, this all depends on how the coins shall be classified. If the coins were lost in the property, you have the right to possession over the coins. If they were mislaid or abandoned, then they are the property of the brewery. For your growler and coat, this falls under the concept of bailments. This is when your property was given by you, voluntarily, to a third party to have it taken care of. Popular examples of bailments include parking garages (Allen v Hyatt), or drycleaners. The duty of bailee's is that they take care of your property, meaning, duty of due care, and that they have a duty to return your property to you. In the case of your growler, you have a claim to receive damages because they failed to take care of it as well as return it to you, specifically because you were given a claim ticket when you gave it to the brewery, which indicated the brewery's acknoweledgement that they have your property in their possession. (Allen v Hyatt) This was the intent of the claim ticket, with a matching number on your growler,and that the only way you would get your growler back is via the bartender that gave you the claim ticket, and that they gave you the option to give them your own growler to fill, and thus, they had the duty of care and to return it to you since they encouraged you to leave your property with them. As in Allen v Hyatt, the plaintiff had parked his car in the hotel garage, which was only possible by him entering the garage, obtaining a claim ticket, and the only way that the car would have left was if the security guard of the garage could have noticed it leave. Even though the brewery may counterargue that they are not to be held accountable for the growler, and, even though they didn't mention whether or not they are responsible for lost, missing or broken items, they try to say that you did not have to give them your growler to fill it with beer, and instead, use what was provided, it is unlikely that the court would hold in their favor and thus you would likely be able to obtain damages from the brewery, due to their lack of duty of care, and to return, for your broken growler. (Allen v Hyatt) As for your coat, this is a different outcome than your growler. Because you had voluntarily left it on a by anyone taking coats and adding ticket coat rack, and, as I understood, it was not accompanied claims as a coat check would, you will be unlikely to receive any damages. Unlike how your growler was taken by a bartender, and you were given a claim ticket, with a matching number on your growler, growler to fill it with beer, and instead, use what was provided, it is unlikely that the court would hold in their favor and thus you would likely be able to obtain damages from the brewery, due to their lack of duty of care, and to return, for your broken growler. (Allen v Hyatt) As for your coat, this is a different outcome than your growler. Because you had voluntarily left it on a coat rack, and, as I understood, it was not accompanied by anyone taking coats and adding ticket claims as a coat check would, you will be unlikely to receive any damages. Unlike how your growler was taken by a bartender, and you were given a claim ticket, with a matching number on your growler, thus, establishing a bailor/bailee relationship, triggering the duties of a bailee, there is no relationship present for your missing coat, thus, you are unlikely to obtain any damages. In conclusion, you will likely obtain damages for your growler only. 1C: The first issue is to find out what interests the parties have due to the language conveyed in the deed that Alex had written. David developer has a present possessory interest in fee simple subject to executory limitation because it has the potential to be cut short if it has not been used for residential purposes. If the property is then used for non-residential purposes, Alex's sons Frank and Fred have an future executory interest in fee simple absolute, meaning, if David uses the property for anything other than residential purposes, they get the property forever. The remaining 5 acres with the brewery and the restaurant, Edward has a present possessory interest in a fee simple determinable, because if he ever uses the warehouse to make IPA's, he could lose the property to Alex, who has a right to entry if the brewery was made to make IPA's. Both interests are subject to Rules Against Perpetuities, because in both cases, the interest may vest beyond the 21 years after a life in being, i.e., the first 5 acre lot can be used as only a residential area for infinite years after the life in being, and the brewery can not make IPA's after the life in being, meaning both are invalid. Alex, then, may automatically have his entire 10 acres reverted back to him due to the invalidity of the deed, and since he is still alive. "," The first issue is whether although Debbie has inherited the property from her father who bought it from Andrew, whether she has obtaine the property via adverse possession from Betty. Adverse possession is established when the possessor has acquired the land by occupying the land in a continuous manner of the required statutory limit, actual possession, hostile, open and notorious, and exclusive. Marengo Cave, Cahill v Morrow, Pimental v Medro, Tieu v Morgan Debbie had also acquired the land in good faith thinking it was solely and entirely hers. She had no reason to believe that she was possibly on land that was not granted to her in good faith. Even though she established the 10 year statutory requirement of adverse possession, her father also had started the time limit upon his occupation of the land. Her possession of the land was actual in she reisded there as her home, it was hostile because she mistakenly thought it was truly hers. Being hostile does not mean she has an ysort of animosity towards the actual owner of the land (Dombkowski v Ferland). It was open and notorious because she had built a home there, spent considerable time and money to improve the land, and it was visible as such, even though she gave permission to visitors to hunt on the land, that does not invalidate the adverse possession (Tieu v Morgan), and, she exclusively used it. Furthermore, she has color of title over the land because the deed of the property give nto her dad had some fraud into it (the forgery of Betty's signature) and thus, the color of title was transferred from her dad to her. Since Chris did not suspect anything, he was a good faith purchasor of the property, thus, under UCC �� 2�312 and 2�402 he is protected from fraudulent sales. Thus, Debbie has a valid claim that she has acquired the property via adverse possession because she has met all the elements required. Betty is unlikely to have any legal claims about the property, even though her name was misused on the deed when her husband sold Greenacre to Chris. Running out of time: Betty has not checked on her property until way after the adverse possession statutory requirement. Betty is unlikely to have any legal claims about the property, even though her name was misused on the deed when her husband sold Greenacre to Chris. Running out of time: Betty has not checked on her property until way after the adverse possession statutory requirement. ",221,2242,421
78231b39-121e-4ec6-acdf-c4d4fdc9b2e0," Before applying the RAP, Oliver Owner grants a contingent remainder in a life estate to each of his two living children Carla and Connor. Oliver's unborn children also have a contingent remainder in a life estate, as it is stated Oliver isn't dead yet and could have more children. The remainder in life estate is contingent because we do not know who Oliver's unborn children are and we also do not know if his living children (Connor & Carla) when they will retire, so it is not vested in one of them. Oliver's nephew Robert has a vested remainder in a life estate, because he doesn't have to satisfy any condition and he is alive at the time of the grant, because it didn't say he was dead. Even if Robert does die it will go to his estate for life. Oliver's grandchildren, Victor and Vivian have different interest, because Victor is 26 so he has satisfied the condition so he will have a vested remainder subject to complete divestment, because before his interest can vest he could die and since it is a class gift other grandkids could take a portion of it. Vivian has an executory interest in fee simple, as well as all other unborn grandkids because she hasn't reached 25 yet so the interest can not vest, and the unborn grandkids are not alive yet. Oliver's estate would have a reversion in fee simple, because potentially none of these interests could vest and the grant would have to return to someone, thus him being the grantor. After applying the Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP), it applies to all interest in the grant expect Robert's life estate, because his is vested and there is no condition he has to fufill (this isn't subject to the RAP). The contingent remainder in a life estate to Oliver's first child to retire is invalid against the RAP, because Oliver could have a child born after the grant that is the first to retire and that could be well after the 21 years from all validating lives at the time of the grant are dead. For example, Oliver could have a kid John, and then him and Carla and Connor die and then John doesn't retire until 55 years after they all die, well past the 21 years. The interest in his grandchildren is also invalid against the RAP, because again Victor and Vivian could die and then Oliver could have a kid named John that lives well past everyone else and doesn't have a kid that reaches 25 until well after the 21 years of the death of all validating lives. If applying the rule of convenience one could argue that Victor, since he has met the at13the time it should) and then Vivian should have condition should have the interest vest (if he is alive the opportunity within her life if she hits 25. All unborn children would have no opportunity. they all die, well past the 21 years. The interest in his grandchildren is also invalid against the RAP, because again Victor and Vivian could die and then Oliver could have a kid named John that lives well past everyone else and doesn't have a kid that reaches 25 until well after the 21 years of the death of all validating lives. If applying the rule of convenience one could argue that Victor, since he has met the condition should have the interest vest (if he is alive at the time it should) and then Vivian should have the opportunity within her life if she hits 25. All unborn children would have no opportunity. So to rewrite the grant it would state: ""To my nephew Robert for life. Then a reversion in fee simple to Oliver Owner's estate."" "," A: To: Brock From: Associate Hi Brock, I reveiewed what we discussed and have written the following memorandum discussing your possibilities in making some money from the developer. Please see the below. The first we need to look at the interest that your brother Alex originally granted to you, which states ""Alex Apple hereby grant this land to myself and my brother Brock to hold jointly as tenants in common."" This could be interpreted two ways, because Alex was ambiguous in his grant. Either you and Alex have a joint tenancy, which would give you the right of survivorship (automatic conveyance of Alex's interest if he dies before you) or you have a tenancy in common with your brother (JT's require four unities: time, title, interest and possession which have all been satisfied here). Under cases such as In Re Estate of Dalton Edward Craigen and Allen v Ford the courts are hesitant and very particular on the language used by grantors and the more ambiguous the language is, they view the construction of the language and usually presume against partial intestancy and dead hand control. Here there is no dead hand control, so we will ignore that. As for the language ""jointly as tenants in common"" seems like it would be a creation of a joint tenancy, giving you and Alex undivided interest in the whole of the 10 acres and a split share of all profits, however courts require very clear language to create a joint tenancy such as ""to A and B in joint tenacy with the right of surviviorship."" Since there was no mention of the right of survivorship, the court will likely assume you have a tenancy in common with Alex. In a tenancy in common you and Alex both have an undivided interest in the property based on the the language and usually presume against partial intestancy and dead hand control. Here there is no dead hand control, so we will ignore that. As for the language ""jointly as tenants in common"" seems like it would be a creation of a joint tenancy, giving you and Alex undivided interest in the whole of the 10 acres and a split share of all profits, however courts require very clear language to create a joint tenancy such as ""to A and B in joint tenacy with the right of surviviorship."" Since there was no mention of the right of survivorship, the court will likely assume you have a tenancy in common with Alex. In a tenancy in common you and Alex both have an undivided interest in the property based on the percentage of interest that you both own. Since in the grant Alex stated you receive half of the business and half the warehouse site, you half a 1/2 interest in tenancy in common with Alex (so you have a right to 1/2 the profits or rent made on the property & you are also liable to pay for mortgages, taxes and any necessary repairs). Within a tenancy in common you have the right to (as do all co-tenants) to divest or convey your interest to anyone you please. So one option you have is selling your one half to the developer and maybe he will pay you for that. However then the developer will have similar issues that you now have that I will soon discuss. You could also try to buy out Alex, but that seems pointless based on what you told me, since he essentially ousted you from the property. You could make a side argument that you have been ousted from the property and now look to seek rent from Alex, but you would have to show likely some further evidence that he has refused to let you back on the property (see Martin v Martin). Another option you have is seeking a partition from the court. There are two types of partitions: a partition in kind and a partition by sale. Courts in theory prefer to use partitions in kind, because they like to protect a property owner that has a vested interest in the property (via money, business, benefical purpose to society), such as the Delfino v Vealencias case. In a partition in kind the court will split up the property by the interest that each tenant has, which in this case the court would try to give both you and Alex an equal half of the property. However, this can be difficult in practice, because some properties have features or characteristics that can not easily be broken up to give each tenant equal value. In your case this may cause a problem for the court, because you and Alex own a 10 acre plot of land that consist of a warehouse with a brewery along with an onsite tasting room and a resturant. The court will likely be unable to break the property up to give you and Alex an equal 1/2 share, because by breaking up the property your brother would lose his business, and the court likely won't agree with destorying his vested interest. Also sometimes courts are hesitant if there are a lot of co- tenants, but that is not an issue here, unless all co-tenants interest are best served by a parition in sale. If the court did grant your parition in kind you and Alex's TIC would be broken and then you could see the developer your new property, but it seems in order to get the most money from the developer you need to sell him all 10 acres. The court will likely be unable to break the property up to give you and Alex an equal 1/2 share, because by breaking up the property your brother would lose his business, and the court likely won't agree with destorying his vested interest. Also sometimes courts are hesitant if there are a lot of co- tenants, but that is not an issue here, unless all co-tenants interest are best served by a parition in sale. If the court did grant your parition in kind you and Alex's TIC would be broken and then you could see the developer your new property, but it seems in order to get the most money from the developer you need to sell him all 10 acres. The other option would be to seek a parition by sale from the court which is much more likely to be granted over the parition in kind. A partition by sale would have all the property sold by the court to the public for market value, and each tenant gets an equal percentage of money as to their percentage owned. However please note the issue with this is that the developer could potentially go around you and buy all the land at auction and never end up giving you any money, but you would receive 1/ the profit from the sale and Alex would receive the other 1/2. Court prefer a partition by sale, because this way the court does not have to fuss over figuring out which tenant should get a portion of the property that is equal to their share. Again the court might be hesitant to grant either partition because your brother Alex does have a vested interest in the property that he could argue is benefical to the people of Bostonia and the court may agree and feel that giving the land to a developer to build isn't the best thing for Bostonia or Alex. For the above options, Alex will argue under Delfinos that he has vested money, emotion and time into creating the brewery and space that exists to today and argue the courts shouldn't take that away from him. As in Delfinos the courts do respect an owners vested interest in property and your brother has had a business here for 5 years. You could try and counter and say that isn't as long as the generational buisness in Delfinos. Also Alex could try and make a creative argument via U.S. v Craft, although this is not a tenancy by the entirety, the dissent in that case stated that the court should protect and support a families interest in a home, because that is the base of a families wealth. I think you could easily counter, because again this isnt an TBE and Alex does not have a family/this property is not even a home. Overall I think you should either try for a parition in sale and then purchase the property from the court and sell it to the developer, or if you can convice the developer, sell him your 1/2 interest so he can be a TIC with Alex and then they can fight over what happens to the property. Also there is no adverse possession argument that could be made, because5 you are both using the property (so not exclusive / permissive because the grant). That way you could make some money and be done with the situatuion. Please let me know if you have follow up. home.

To: Carl From: Associate Hi Carl I have done some research as to your questions regarding coins, coat and growler. Your legal rights as to the coins you found could potentially be seen as your property or as Alex and Brock's (the owners of the property in which you found them). First, you could argue under Armory that this is lost property, and you were the first finder to it. So against all other finders, people in the world you have the best claim to it against the owner, and the owner is no where to be found here. Therefore Brock and Alex [or whoever has the coins, was slightly unclear from your hypo] can not claim them. This is could likely not a strong argument, because if since these are gold coins that are from the 1800s, these clearly fall under the embedded or treasure trouve property--if New Suffolk courts have either of those as rules in their jurisdiction. Under embedded property as seen in Corliss v Wenner you would not receive the gold coins, even though you found them. The coins would instead go to the property owner where they were found. In embedded jurisdictions the courts have a policy to limit and prevent treasure hunters from trespassing onto people's land and then looking for treasure and claiming it. There is a fear of self help measures being used as in Jacque v Steenberg Homes. So in embedded jurisdictions the coins would go to Alex and Brock, because they are the landowners of the property where the coins were found. Under a treasure trouve jurisdiction you would receieve the coins, because items such as gold coins from decades ago are viewed as treasure where the previous owner is clearly long dead and the property has essentially been left behind. So the first finder gets the property here, which is you. Please note treasure trouve and embedded property rules are 6not followed in most courts, so I will have to see what New Suffolk does. and Brock, because they are the landowners of the property where the coins were found. Under a treasure trouve jurisdiction you would receieve the coins, because items such as gold coins from decades ago are viewed as treasure where the previous owner is clearly long dead and the property has essentially been left behind. So the first finder gets the property here, which is you. Please note treasure trouve and embedded property rules are not followed in most courts, so I will have to see what New Suffolk does. Alex and Brock, would likely argue against you that the coins, although themselves are very old and a treasure item, they were however wrapped in a bag from a local grocery store that only opened 10 years ago, so they could make a strong claim for mislaid property. Mislaid property reverts to the owner of the property, as seen in McAvoy v Medina, because the courts mind set is that the owner unintentially misplace their item and will likely come back for it, so in the meantime the property owner should hold on to it. Thus setting up a clear standard for people to follow. You could counter saying that where the coins where found was an odd spot, where clearly the previous owner had concealed them in a hole in the warehouse and had been their likely 10 whole years. Also clearly Ben and Alex had never noticed. Therefore you could argue under Hannah v Peele that the court should not follow the traditional mislaid property ruling, because you are a good faith finder and should be rewarded. Or you could argue under Benjamin that the coins were abandoned and now they would go to the first finder, because they were originally mislaid hence being stored in the grocery store back from only a ten year old store, but as many as ten years could have gone by and the owner has not come back for them and therefore they are now abandonded, so you, the first finder, should get them. Overall the court will likely rule this to be mislaid property, because 10 years is only a potential possibility for the coins to have been there so they are not yet abandoned and were clearly stored there by the previous owner. As for your coat you could make a strong argument for lost property. You did unitentially leave it behind and you no longer know exactly where it is so the item is lost, and that would give you the best claim to any finders because you are the owner (Armory if the owner of the ring jewels turned up). So whoever has it you could collect it from them because you are the true owner. Alex and Brock, if they have it could argue mislaid property and keep it against all, expect you, so they would not have a strong claim to your coat if you are willing to try and recover it. You could potentially try and make a creative bailment arguement to find Alex and Brock liable for your coat, because you entered into their business and left it, so they should be partially responsible for it. However this is likely not a strong arugment, but for your growler it is stronger. As for your growler you could argue a bailment claim for Alex and Brock's bartender/employee breaking it. Under Hyatt a bailee is responsible for a bailor's property if the bailee took the property in have it could argue mislaid property and keep it against all, expect you, so they would not have a strong claim to your coat if you are willing to try and recover it. You could potentially try and make a creative bailment arguement to find Alex and Brock liable for your coat, because you entered into their business and left it, so they should be partially responsible for it. However this is likely not a strong arugment, but for your growler it is stronger. As for your growler you could argue a bailment claim for Alex and Brock's bartender/employee breaking it. Under Hyatt a bailee is responsible for a bailor's property if the bailee took the property in for a certain period of time and there is reasons to believe it should have been protected and treated with care. Alex and Brock could counter by arguing this wasn't a situation with a car in a garage, and the growler was of very little economic value, and glasses, growlers, plates etc, break in bars all the time. So the bailment here was not as great and shouldn't be seen as the equivlent. You could argue to the court that this growler has a significant amount of value to you and means a lot, so it may not have the same value to Brock and Alex's employees. Overall the court will likely not accept your bailment argument, because the value of the value of the growler is likely not on par with the value of bailments that are usually accepted in the courts. C. To: Alex From: Associate As for the interest you conveyed to David you will be able to challenge him on that, because even though the interest you conveyed to him is not valid against the RAP, when it is corrected you receive the possibility of reverter. You originally conveyed a fee simple subject to executory limiation (as long as isn't used for non-residential purposes), and an executory interest in fee simple to your two sons, Frank and Fred. The interest to Frank and Fred is invalid, because 21 years after all the validating lives deaths someone that gets the property from David could use the property in a way that breaks the limitation and it would then vest well after 21 years to one of his sons/their estates. You could try and counter and argue under the wait and see approch David has broken the limitation so the property should vest to your sons, but that will likely not work as courts follow the RAP. So now David has a fee simple determinable, because for as long as (Marhenholz) is a word of duration and that creates this interest, which has the possibility of revert if the condition is broken and then the grantor would automatically receive the property back in fee simple. Therefore you would be able to immediately take the property (5 acres) back from David. As for Edward you would likely be able to take the property back either by the right of re-entry or the should vest to your sons, but that will likely not work as courts follow the RAP. So now David has a fee simple determinable, because for as long as (Marhenholz) is a word of duration and that creates this interest, which has the possibility of revert if the condition is broken and then the grantor would automatically receive the property back in fee simple. Therefore you would be able to immediately take the property (5 acres) back from David. As for Edward you would likely be able to take the property back either by the right of re-entry or the possibility of reverter. The issue is when you wrote the grant you had language of duration (so long as) as seen in a fee simple determinable that gives the automatic right of the possibility of reverter if a condition is broken, and also language of a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, because you wrote in you would have the right to re enter and take the premise. Courts are particular about the language when a grant/deed is ambigous as seen in (Marhenhalz, Allen, Craigen, and Symphony Space). Here since you used both language that could be implicate each you will definately be able to collect the property from Edward, it just will depend if it is automatic, if the court sees this as a fee simple determinable or if it will be under the right of action in a right to re-enter, because it also looks like a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Overall I think the court will decide this as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, because you clearly used language that states this to be seen as you having a right to re-enter and take the property. Please also note this is not subject to the RAP, because neither a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent are under the rule. Edward doesn't have a real counter, because he broke the condition. "," As for Debbie, she could make a claim to the property via adverse possession by color of title. Color of title is when someone receives a false or invalid title to a piece of land, but still meets all elements of adverse possession. Even if they only use a possession of the land under the deed, if the other owner is not present they get all of the land under the deed. So here since Betty was never present Debbie could arguably try and claim complete control of the property under her color of title that her father, Chris received from Andrew. First we will discuss the elemets of adverse possession and if they were met. Note under the the case Tieu v Morgan we are able to see that Chris and Debbie's time of possession can be tacked together by voluntary transfer so Betty can't argue that, although she could raise the fact that Debbie was not fully using her any of the land until 2011, so there was a two year gap between that and 2009. The first element for adverse possession is actual. Meaning that Chris and Debbie would have to show actual use of the property for the years required to establish adverse possesion, which is usally 10 years Note under the the case Tieu v Morgan we are able to see that Chris and Debbie's time of possession can be tacked together by voluntary transfer so Betty can't argue that, although she could raise the fact that Debbie was not fully using her any of the land until 2011, so there was a two year gap between that and 2009. The first element for adverse possession is actual. Meaning that Chris and Debbie would have to show actual use of the property for the years required to establish adverse possesion, which is usally 10 years [I do not see a statue stated]. For the past 18 years, Chris and Debbie have arguably been on the land and in actual poession. Again as stated above Betty could argue that Debbie wasn't actually around for two years, but I will raise that under continuos element. The next element is if the adverse possession by Chris and Debbie was open and notorious. I would argue that it was, because Chris moved there for points during the year and openly used the land for hiking in the woods, and he also improved the small wooden cabin that was on the property. Debbie then moved to Greenacre and build her own small house on the land and maintained a small garden. Betty could argue that this was only 2 acres of the land and Betty also didn't use the rest of the land, so if she is entitled to anything under adverse possession it would be limited to these two acres, because although Chris had a right to everything and transfered that to her, she broke that be only using 2 acres. Betty could sight to Margeno Cave and state that Debbie wasn't using the full land in an open and notorious way as well, because she never knew as Ross did that her use was present. However this will likely not be successful, because the circumstances are different. The next element is continuous. This can be argued that Chris and Debbie did both not use the land continuously as the owner would have. The land was meant for hunting and fishing, and at the time Chris was there he only used it for about 8 weeks out of the year for fishing season, and did not hunt. When Andrew was up there it was said that he there quite often so Betty could argue Chris' eight years on the land don't meet this standard because he did not use the land the same way that Andrew did. As for Debbie's use being continuous, Betty could argue it was not because from 2009 to 2011 Debbie was absent, so that broke/splits the 10 year period required, and this could potentially ruin Debbie's adverse possession claim. The next element is if the use of the property was exclusive. Betty will argue that is was not, because other hunters, fisherman/fishwoman, and people where using the property to do those activities. However, Chris and Debbie both gave permission for those visitors to do that, as did the original owner Andrew. Thus since as Andrew gave permission, Chris and Debbie could argue that they were also giving permission so their use was still exclusive (as seen in Tieu v Morgan use was still exclusive even possession claim. The next element is if the use of the property was exclusive. Betty will argue that is was not, because other hunters, fisherman/fishwoman, and people where using the property to do those activities. However, Chris and Debbie both gave permission for those visitors to do that, as did the original owner Andrew. Thus since as Andrew gave permission, Chris and Debbie could argue that they were also giving permission so their use was still exclusive (as seen in Tieu v Morgan use was still exclusive even when the neighbor asked to park his boat). Thus Betty will likely not have a strong argument against this, and even Debbie strickly forbid people on her own 2 acre house. The final element is adverse and hostile. Here Debbie will have a strong claim, because her father Chris got the title (color of title) to green acre from Andrew, and so it wasn't permissive, because he essentially bought the rights to the land. Debbie then received Greenacre from her father, so she also was acting on this non-permissive grant, and I would argue it is not permissive even though it is a grant from Andrew, because it was actually faulty, but then Chris and now Debbie have stayed on the land for over a combined 18 years arguably and also arguably meet the elements of adverse possession. Overall I think Debbie has a strong claim to adverse possession of the property, but the element of the possession of the entire property is weak, because she is not in actual use of 48 acres, so Betty would likely receive that from the court, and could even maybe defeat her claim outright, because Debbie was not possessing the land as an owner would for at least two years (2009-2011). As for Betty's claim to the property she could very strongly argue that Andrew never had the right to transfer Greenacre to Chris in the first place, because under a tenancy by entirety, a spouse can not convey or divest interest, unless they have consent from their spouse. Clearly here Betty never gave Andrew permission. A tenancy by the entirety is similar to a a joint tenancy in that they are both set up with the right of survivorship and they need the four unities of time, title, possession and interest. They are different in that a spouse can not unilaterally sever without consent of another spouse or convey interest without another spouses permission (what Andrew did). Also each spouse has an undivided interest in the whole of property. Looking at the right of survivorship here, Betty can argue that when Andrew died in 2004 she should have received all property that they had under their TBE. So therefore when Andrew died in 2004 she would have receieved Greenarce. Debbie could still argue that the adverse possession by her father began in 2001 and even if it began in 2004 it has still be over 10 years to the present day in 2019. So unfortunately for Betty the right of survivorship here does not do her much good, because although Andrew never had the ability to sell Chris the land, Chris and Debbie have a strong adverse possession interest in the whole of property. Looking at the right of survivorship here, Betty can argue that when Andrew died in 2004 she should have received all property that they had under their TBE. So therefore when Andrew died in 2004 she would have receieved Greenarce. Debbie could still argue that the adverse possession by her father began in 2001 and even if it began in 2004 it has still be over 10 years to the present day in 2019. So unfortunately for Betty the right of survivorship here does not do her much good, because although Andrew never had the ability to sell Chris the land, Chris and Debbie have a strong adverse possession claim. Betty could seek to recover at least 48 acres of the land from Debbie who is not really using that land and is located on just the two. As under a color of title a false title holder is only able to collect the land that they are using under the deed if the owner is using the other portions. However unfortunately for Betty she has never visited or even realized she had Greenacre until recently, so a court will likely not allow this. Courts want property to be used for productive purposes, and they wanted to propect people's invested wealth into land, and clearly Debbie has done that by building a house and letting visitors hunt and fish on the open land. Betty could maybe potentially counter and argue that she would do the same, and the land was originally hers to begin with. Overall Betty should focus on the weak claims of adverse possession that Debbie has to prove such as continuous use, because there was a period where Debbie was not on the land from when he father died, and that would break up the tacking of time.

3563df1a-2ee1-4323-a204-fb3a13e13f57," Connor and Carla both have vested remainder interests in a life estate in fee simple subject to complete divestment. The words of purchase say ""to the first of my children"", and because Connor and Carla are both the only children of Oliver alive during the time of the of conveyance of the grant, making them both ascertainable, both of their future interests in the estate are the same (vested remainders subject to condition subsequent). Despite being ascertainable, they are still subject to the same condition subsequent, upon which of them are first to retire, to receive the life estate. However, if Connor and Carla were both to die before either one of them having retired, before Oliver dies, then the life estate would still be possessed by Oliver. Once Oliver dies (in the situation where Connor and Carla both die before having retired), then the possessory life estate would go to Robert. Robert, prior to receiving the possessory life estate, (aka, before Oliver died in this situation), had a executory remainder interest in life estate in fee simple. Upon Oliver's death, and after both Connor and Carla die (or upon the death of the first of Connor or Carla to retire, the life estate would be Robert's. Oliver's grandchildren, both alive at the time of the grant, have different interests. Victor has a indefeasibly vested remainder in fee simple, because he's already 26 years old, and Vivian has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple subject to condition subsequent. The only people subject to the RUle against perpetuities in this example are both Connor and Carla, Olivers living children during the time of the grant, and Vivian, Oliver's grand daughter. All three people are subject to RAP because they all hold the same vested remainder subject to open interest. In order to satisfy the rule against perpetuities, the future interest at quesiton (must be either: contingent remainders, vested remainders sub. to open, or executory interests), must be vested (or settled by vesting), or have failed within 21 years from the time it was accrued, which would satisfy the rule and make the interest void. "," 1a: (brock asks you if there are any steps he can take to make some money from the developer. In order to satisfy the rule against perpetuities, the future interest at quesiton (must be either: contingent remainders, vested remainders sub. to open, or executory interests), must be vested (or settled by vesting), or have failed within 21 years from the time it was accrued, which would satisfy the rule and make the interest void. 2) 1a: (brock asks you if there are any steps he can take to make some money from the developer. what is the nature of the property interest, and the possibilities available to him, Brock). The nature of your property interest has to do with the law of joint tenancy/tenancy in common. This issue here is whether you have the right to sell your tenancy to the developer, despite Alex not wanting to sell. The rules of tenancy come to play in this scenario between you and your brother. A1 - You paid your brother a sum of money for half of he brewery business. Your brother will probably argue, bases on the rules regarding joint tenancy and tenancy in common, that because you only paid for half of the business, and that the business was wholly his business in the first place, that you are not entitled to sell your common share of the brewery, despite the written deed. However, you can argue that the written deed, signed by your brother, gives you the right to sell your share, as long as you sever the tenancy in common between you and your brother. In order for you to do that, you must sever by conveying your interest to someone else, or by selling (but in order to sell, your brother must assent to the sale/severence, according to the rule). So you do have a couple options. Because you both are tenants in common, you both equally own the business, with rights of survivorship, meaning that if your brother died before you, you would sole owner of the business and no longer have the possessory interest, or vice versa. So if your brother happens to die, you would gain full ownership and survive the tenancy, and then you could sell. 1b) Carl wants to know from you if he can keep the gold coins, his growler, and his coat. In a letter to Carl, explain his legal rights, if any, to these 3 items. Also discuss any competing interests or counter args related to each item. Dear Carl, In regards to your claim of the coins, the nature of your interest here is a question of wrongful possession, in regards to ownership 1b) Carl wants to know from you if he can keep the gold coins, his growler, and his coat. In a letter to Carl, explain his legal rights, if any, to these 3 items. Also discuss any competing interests or counter args related to each item. Dear Carl, In regards to your claim of the coins, the nature of your interest here is a question of wrongful possession, in regards to ownership The issue here is whether you are entitled to ownership of the coins, because you found them. You unfortunately do not have the best claim to the coins right now, according to the rule of finder's law, because you did indeed find them, but you found them in a hole inside the store, of which the name of the store was on the mesh bag that contained the coins in them. You could argue that the coins could have been there for years, and forgotten about by the store. Howevcer, the store might argue that they have only been open for 10 years, so they couldn't have been forgotten about or lost for that long, at least long enough to go over the statute of limitations on this doctrine. Regarding the growler and your coat: you made the decision to leave without the bar after hearing that the bartender saw an employee drop and break the growler. You also still chose to leave after seeing that your coat was missing. You might have some arguments for the coin appraisal, However. - coin appraisal: argument in favor of Carl... 1c): Alex, you decided to divide the 10 acre property in 2016 by selling to DAvid, after Brock sold you his interest about 10 years prior. David holds the vested remainder interest in half of 10 divided acres, subject to divestment in fee simple. You sons Frank and Fred hold a contingent remainder interest in fee simple subject to condition subsequent (the condition subsequent is if David starts using his interest for non-residential purposes, then Frank and Fred would cut short David's interest in the 5 acres). The other 5 acres you sold and conveyed to Edward by deed, which included the warehouse containing the brewery/restaurant. Edward had a contingent remainder interest in life estate in fee simple subject to condition subsequent. If Edward were to meet that condition by making IPA's on the property, you would have a right to re-enter, or ""Right of Entry"" and reclaim the 5 acres, making the interest yours again.

Victor has a vested remainder in fee simple subject to partial divestment/in an open class Vivian has an executory interest in fee simple Any unborn grandchildren of Oliver also have an executory interest in fee simple The grant to ""the first of my childen to retire for life"" violates the RAP. While Connor and Carla can serve as their own lives in being, any unborn children would be tied to Connor, Carla, Oliver and Robert at the time of the grant, who could all die more than twenty-one years prior to their retirement, meaning that their interest would not vest within a life in being at the time of the grant + 21 years. As the grant is not a will, this clock runs from its formation, not at the time of Oliver's death as it would in a will. The grant to Robert is also void, as a violation of the RAP strikes the grant after that point, but this grant in itself does not violate the rule, as Robert is his wn life in being. The grant to Olivers grandchildren who reach 25 is also void, as not only does it come after a prior void interest, but it is possible that children could be born to possible unborn children, who would themselves not have lives in being, and who could turn 25 after the life in being + 21 years of Robert, Oliver, Carla, Connor, Victor and Vivian.

"," 1a.) Brock's property interest is a tenancy in common, and not a joint tenancy. This is because Alex's terminology, ""jointy, as tenants in common,"" not only specifies tenancy in common, but also because courts place a presumption of tenancty in common over joint tenancy. This means that Brock does not have a right of survivorship. It also means that both Brock and Alex hold a 50% financial stake each, and also an undivided possessory interest in the property. Tenants in common can sell their interests to others. Should the developer be receptive, Brock could sell his stake in the property to the developer. This would be the simplest solution for Brock, as the developer would be free to negotiate with Alex or persue litigation, leaving the developer with a 50% financial interest and an undivided posessory interest of the property with Alex. Similarly, Brock could a preference to partitian in kind, in this case it persue litigation to partitian the land. While courts3have would be difficult to do so, as the brewery is more valuble than the vacant land surrounding it and if the facts pursuant to question 1c hold true for this question. (that the Brewery, warehouse and tasting room Tenants in common can sell their interests to others. Should the developer be receptive, Brock could sell his stake in the property to the developer. This would be the simplest solution for Brock, as the developer would be free to negotiate with Alex or persue litigation, leaving the developer with a 50% financial interest and an undivided posessory interest of the property with Alex. Similarly, Brock could persue litigation to partitian the land. While courts have a preference to partitian in kind, in this case it would be difficult to do so, as the brewery is more valuble than the vacant land surrounding it and if the facts pursuant to question 1c hold true for this question. (that the Brewery, warehouse and tasting room are on 5 acres and the other 5 acres are vacant.) In either of these two cases (developer vs. Alex or Brock vs. Alex), a partitian of sale would be more favorable to the developer or to Brock, as the developer wishes to develop the entire 10 acres into condos, while Brock wishes to sell to him. Alex would likely prefer a partitian in kind that would allow him to keep running his business on the remaining 5 acres while the other 5 acres would be given to either the developer or to Brock. A partitian in kind would be difficult in this case; as stated above, the half of the land with the brewery, restaurant, and tasting room are much more valuable than the vacant lots. The fact that the business takes up half of the property distinguishes this case somewhat from (the Garbage dump owner v. Real Estate Developer case). In that case, the dump owner had a smaller financial interest in the land she was using for her business, but the garbage dump only took up a small portion of the property. The court granted a partitian in kind, due to the particular interest in the land that she had through running a business on the land that had been in her family for many years. As in that case, however, a court could grant a partitian in kind by requiring Alex to pay an owlelty payment. This could be difficult, however, as Alex would not only need to pay Brock for the difference in the fifty percent stake in the land, but also for his fifty percent stake in the successful business. Alex could attempt to reduce this payment by arguing that, unlike in the garbage dump case, the presence of a restaurant and brewery in the neighborhood would cause the value of the adjacent land to appreciate in value, whereas a garbage dump depreciated the value of the surrounding land. Also, as Alex committed financially to the property, where the facts show that Brock has not invested himself as much as Alex; Alex could attempt to recoup this value during any partitian. To attempt to secure a partitian by sale, Brock could argue that (1) the nature of the property would make it difficult to partian it equally and (2) it would be in the economic interest of all parties to sell the land. The $2m the developer is offering is far for than the $500k that the land was initially purchased for. However, a forced sale of the land ultimately might not be in Brock's best interest, as forced judicial sales tend to devalue the property, and ultimately the developer or any other buyer could purchase the land for much lower than the initial $2m that was offered.

To avoid the costs of litigation, it would be in Brock's best interest to attempt to negociate with Alex if willing. There are several proposals that would be mutually beneficial. Brock could propose that they simply sell the remaining vacant half of the land to the developer, were the developer willing to purchase only half, and split the proceeds evenly between them. Brock could also offer to grant Alex his 50% stake in the busines in exchange for full ownership of the vacant lots, with payment on either side to make up the difference in value, likely from Alex's end, after which Brock could do as he wished with the vacant lot. Additionally, as Alex ousted Brock from the property by demanding that Brock ""leave and never come back,"" Brock can argue that Alex committed an ouster, and demand rent for Alex's use of the business. This could both make some money for Brock, as well as put pressure on Alex to negociate. 3) 1b) It is likely that the gold coins found in the wall of the warehouse would be considered embedded property, as distinct from a treasure trove. While the coins themselves are very old and valuable, which classically fall within the definition of a treasure trove, the fact they have been placed in a bag from a grocery store that opened ten years ago indicates that the bag has been in the wall for ten years or less; treasure trove doctrine, in jurisdictions that recognize it, typically require the items to have been there for a long enough period of time such that the original owner is long deceased and unable to claim the coins. Ten years is not a long enough time to satisfy this. Embedded property belongs to the owner of the land they are found in, (the North Dakota case where items were found during construction of a driveway), which would give Alex and Brock ownership over the coins, not Carl. This is the strongest argument of the ownership of the coins. A court could also find that the coins are mislaid property, as they were likely placed there. This would a long enough period of time such that the original owner is long deceased and unable to claim the coins. Ten years is not a long enough time to satisfy this. Embedded property belongs to the owner of the land they are found in, (the North Dakota case where items were found during construction of a driveway), which would give Alex and Brock ownership over the coins, not Carl. This is the strongest argument of the ownership of the coins. A court could also find that the coins are mislaid property, as they were likely placed there. This would still prevent Carl from owning the coins, as Alex and Brock would have ownership of the coins in this case as well, second only to the unknown person who placed them there within the last ten years. Carl would need to argue that the property was abandoned or lost for him to be able to claim it. However, as the coins were found in the wall, it is far more likely that Alex and Brock could claim that the bag constitutes embedded property. The growler placed with the bartender constituted a bailment. Carl gave the growler to the bartender, and recieved a claim ticket in exchange, indicating that the bartender (and the business as a whole) would be then responsible for overseeing it. Carl would be able to recover the value of the growler from the business, as the business did not observe their duty of care over the item. The coat, however, is placed on a coat rack by the door, where anyone would have access to it. Carl would be able to ague that the coat being placed on the rack also creates a bailor/bailee relationship between he and the business. However, as the coat was placed on a rack by the door, as opposed to a coat check, it is likely that a court would find that its placement on the rack does not constitute a bailment. 4) 1c) Prior to the sales to D and E: Alex has a fee simple For the vacant lots: David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation Frank and Fred each have a shifting executory interest in fee simple. Alex has nothing. Alex has a fee simple For the vacant lots: David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation Frank and Fred each have a shifting executory interest in fee simple. Alex has nothing. Alex has sold the property to David. He himself no longer has a legal claim to the property. However, Frank and Fred would be able to exercise thier executory interest over the vacant lots and claim them, due to the fact that David has violated the conditions in the deed. For the brewery: Edward has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent Alex has a right of entry. Here, Edward has violated the condition by starting to make IPAs. The property does not pass on to Alex automatically, however; he would need to exercise his right of entry and reclaim the property. This is distinct from a fee simple determinable/possibility of reverter relationship of interests, in which case the property would automatically revert to Alex. "," 2.) Andrew and Betty, as Tenants by the Entirety, do not have a unilateral right to sever the Tenancy. By forging the Betty's name on the selling deed, Andrew has transferred a voidable title over the property in regards to Betty's interests, as he is a fraudster. It also means that Betty has a right of survivorship over Andrew's portion of any property they owned together, as while they were estranged, they never divorced. By purchasing from Andrew without knowlege of the forgery of Betty's signature, Chris is a good faith Andrew and Betty, as Tenants by the Entirety, do not have a unilateral right to sever the Tenancy. By forging the Betty's name on the selling deed, Andrew has transferred a voidable title over the property in regards to Betty's interests, as he is a fraudster. It also means that Betty has a right of survivorship over Andrew's portion of any property they owned together, as while they were estranged, they never divorced. By purchasing from Andrew without knowlege of the forgery of Betty's signature, Chris is a good faith purchaser. A good faith purchaser who purchases voidable title from someone, for example if he does so without suspecting that the deed was forged, is able to claim color of title over the land, and hold it over the original owner. This is distinct from (the case of the stolen Rolex), as Chris does not suspect that the title is bad, unlike the prospective buyer of the watch in that case. By building the cabin on the land, he is also a good faith improver of the land. Through his use of nature walks and using the fishing cabin for eight years on a seasonal basis, and by allowing neighbors to hunt and fish on the premises while he is not present, Chris is behaving in a manner consistent with an owner of the land. Debbie recieved the land through volunary conveyance from Chris. She is also a good faith improver, building a large home on the property and clearing the area of trees to create a formal garden. While Debbie herself does not venture out into the woods, by allowing others to hunt and fish on the land in a manner consistent with the previous owners, Debbie is also behaving in a way that shows she at least claims that portion of the land. It is unlikely that, were the need to arise, Debbie would be able to claim adverse posession over the property. The elements of adverse posession require that the owner's posession for the statute of limitations period be (1) continuous, (2) open and notorious, (3) exclusive, and (4) hostile. Elements (1), (2), and (3) are satisfied. Chris purchased the property in 2001. In 2009, Chris died, voluntarily leaving Greenacre to his daughter. Because the conveyance was voluntary, Debbie can tack her time from 2009-2019 with Chris' time from 2001-2009. This more than satisifes the 10 year period in the statute. Both Chris and Debbie openly and notoriously showed their ownership of the property, as both allowed for hunters to use it; this shows that they publically made themselves known as the property owners. The element of continousness was also met. Chris used the land on a seasonal basis each year, which is consistent with a normal property owner. While Debbie did not move in until 2011, she build a large home and cleared two acres of land around it during the intervening two years, which is also consistent with the use of a normal property owner. The element of exclusivity is also met; the hunters and fishermen who entered the property did so only with Chris' and Debbie's permission; exclusivity is not interupted by those the adverse posessor allows onto the property. both allowed for hunters to use it; this shows that they publically made themselves known as the property owners. The element of continousness was also met. Chris used the land on a seasonal basis each year, which is consistent with a normal property owner. While Debbie did not move in until 2011, she build a large home and cleared two acres of land around it during the intervening two years, which is also consistent with the use of a normal property owner. The element of exclusivity is also met; the hunters and fishermen who entered the property did so only with Chris' and Debbie's permission; exclusivity is not interupted by those the adverse posessor allows onto the property. The question of hostility comes into question, and can be argued from either side. Betty can argue that, because the conveyance was a sale from her husband, Andrew, the hostility element was not met, as Chris took posession of the property with permission of the prior owner. Debbie, however, could make the argument that the adverse posession began with Andrew, who by selling Betty's portion of the property, adversely posessed her stake, though this would be a novel argument and less likely to win. Additionally, even if Debbie were to succeed in proving an adverse posession claim, Betty could argue that she only did so under color of title, and would only be entitled to the portion of the property she occupies. Debbie in turn could argue that her occupation of the entirety of the propetty is evidenced by the fact that her's and Chris' allowing of hunters to use the remainder of property is in itself a form of use, giving her dominion over the entire property. Further, as Chris was a good faith purchaser, Debbie could argue that she inherited a valid title, one that Betty no longer has a claim against. Further, in Debbie's worst case, where the court would find that Betty was the title owner, Debbie could claim to be a good faith improver, which would allow her to at minumum keep the home she has constructed on the premises, with Betty only entitled to the value of the undeveloped land the home and gardens were build on.

5b58226f-9ae5-4ad2-8261-d659f95da503," The present interest is held by Oliver in fee simple, subject to executory limitation. This is because the interest of his first child to retire will not vest until one retires first. The two children of Oliver are currently working. Because this interest has not vested, Oliver has a present possessory estate in fee simple with executory limitation. As a defeasible present interest it will not 'wait patiently' the future executory interest will take hold once it vests. This will happen as soon as Oliver's child Connor or Carla reitres first. The future interests are held first by Conor and Carla having a future interest of an executory interest in a life estate. Seperately, Conor has a future interest subject to complete divestment in a life estate, ie if Carla retires first it will completely divest. And Carla in turn as a future interest subject to complete divestement in a life estate, it will completely divest id Connor retires first. Second future estate is Robert has a vested remainder in a life etstae fallowing the natural end of either Connor or Carla's life estate. Third future estate is the granchildren who reach 25 yrs old, they hold together a contingent remainder in fee simple subject to open. Specifically Victor has a vested remainder in fee simple subject to open, and Vivian has a contingent remainder in fee simple subject to open hers will vest when she turns 25. The unborn granchildren have a contigent remainder in fee simple subject to open. Fourth future interest is Oliver whom has a reversion in fee simple. If all granchildren die, after the natural end of Roberts life the interest will revert back to the Grantor, Oliver. Same scenario if Robert dies, but Oliver will have a present possession in fee simple subj to executory limitation. the grandchildren will have an executory interest in fee simple subject to open. Then, in the last morbid scenario, if Olivers children, Connor and Carla die, and their children die, and Robert dies. Oliver will take the estate back in fee simple as a reversion and his estate will fallow his will and or the rules of intestatcy if he does not have a will. Rules Against Perpetiuities (RAP), apply here in New Suffolk. This common law rule was created by the courts to limit the ""dead hand control"" of the grantors. This insures that a Grantor cannot control dies, but Oliver will have a present possession in fee simple subj to executory limitation. the grandchildren will have an executory interest in fee simple subject to open. Then, in the last morbid scenario, if Olivers children, Connor and Carla die, and their children die, and Robert dies. Oliver will take the estate back in fee simple as a reversion and his estate will fallow his will and or the rules of intestatcy if he does not have a will. Rules Against Perpetiuities (RAP), apply here in New Suffolk. This common law rule was created by the courts to limit the ""dead hand control"" of the grantors. This insures that a Grantor cannot control the estate far far into the future. It is not pleasuisble to see where the estate will be in 3 or more generation. The rule is that a title is void if the interest will vest or fail NOT within 21 years of a death of a life in being during the grant. For instance the lives in being during the grant will be come ""validating lives"" and upon their death plus 21 years the interesrts but vest or fail. RAP applies to; contingent remainders, executory interests, open classes, and option contracts. Applying the RAP here, the future interest of Connor and Carla is valid. as a contingent remainder the rule does apply. But, as their own validating lives because they were lives in being during the grant, it will either vest or fail upon eithers death. is. when Connor dies eaither he did reitre first or he didnt. Same with Carla Applying RAP to Robert, his vested remainder in a life estate. vested remainders are not subj to RAP, thus it is a valid interest. Applying RAP to the granchildren whom reach 25, this is void. It is void because Oliver, Carla, Connor, Robert, Victor, and Vivian are all dead. But before Connor or Carla died they had another child X. This child is not their own validating life, and all validating lives have dead. Then with the contition of ""reach 25"" X interest in fee simple will vest outside the RAP time. Thus, it is void. To rewrite the interest so that there is no voidable tiel under the RAP it will be as fallows; to the first of my children to retire for life, then to my nephew Robert for life, then to my grandchildren then living. This means that the granchildrens interest will either vest or fail upon the death or Carla or Connor plus 21yrs. There can be no more grandchildren in Oliver's children are dead. In contrast, modern courts have been implementing Rule of Convienace for class gifts that are void under RAP. Under this rule if there is at least one person in the class that is 'vested' at the time of conveyance or the death of the last validating life, the class will close, and the vested persons will hold valid title. In this example Victor whom is 26 and3has a vested remainder subj to open, will vest and the class will close on his 'unborn' or contingent siblings. Connor plus 21yrs. There can be no more grandchildren in Oliver's children are dead. In contrast, modern courts have been implementing Rule of Convienace for class gifts that are void under RAP. Under this rule if there is at least one person in the class that is 'vested' at the time of conveyance or the death of the last validating life, the class will close, and the vested persons will hold valid title. In this example Victor whom is 26 and has a vested remainder subj to open, will vest and the class will close on his 'unborn' or contingent siblings. "," 1a. Brock's property interest Brock, your interest with Alex is a concurrant interest in a tenancy in common. A tenancy in common is the default concurrant interest. It is not a Joint Tenancy, becuase a Joint Tenancy requires the 4 unities. The four unities are; time, title, interest and possession. (1) Time is not satisfied because Alex granted his interest to be shared by with you. Thus, Alex technically had the interest first. If you wanted to satisfy this requireent there needed to be a ""strawman"" this is a person whom Alex would have conyed his interest to, and then the ""strawman"" would reconvey the interest back to you and alex at the same time. (2) Title, this means both you and alex are devised this concurrant interest under the same title, this is satisfied. (3) Interest, the interest for both Alex and yourself needs to be equal. One of you cannot have a greator or lesser interest than the other. Here you both have 1/2 interest, this element is satisfied. (4) Posession, along with Tenancy in Common, within Joint tenancy both holders of interest are allowed to posesses the whole. This is satified it seems. The language Alex used was ambiguous "" to hold jointly as tenants in common"" but courts in order to declare a Joint tenancy need the 4 unities and explicit language of ""right of survivorship"", which is not present. The ""Right of survivorship"" means that when one cotenant dies their interest will be equally divided amonst the living co tenants in a Joint tenancy. The interest of the dead tenant will NOT be devised by will. Joint tenancy will only be severed in the instance of a unilateral transfer, ouster, murder, or a mortgage in a title theory jurisdiction. Courts have two mortgage theories (1) title theory, where a mortgage will act as though on concurant tenant has unilaterally conveyed their interest and sever the joint tenancy. (2) Lien theory, where the mortgage will act as a lein theory and not sever the joint tenancy. This was decided in the case Tiue v Morgan. But here in Alex and your 10 Brock, it is a tenancy in common. case, For specifically your plan to take the 2mil and sell the brewery is not possible as a Tenant in Common severed in the instance of a unilateral transfer, ouster, murder, or a mortgage in a title theory jurisdiction. Courts have two mortgage theories (1) title theory, where a mortgage will act as though on concurant tenant has unilaterally conveyed their interest and sever the joint tenancy. (2) Lien theory, where the mortgage will act as a lein theory and not sever the joint tenancy. This was decided in the case Tiue v Morgan. But here in Alex and your case, Brock, it is a tenancy in common. For specifically your plan to take the 2mil and sell the brewery is not possible as a Tenant in Common with Alex. Alex needs to consent. It is NOT allowed in a tenancy in common, even with 50% interest, to convey ""half of the land"" to a third party. When you need to do is sever the Tenancy in Common with Alex. This will be either in a partician in kind or partician by Sale. A partician in kind is when the court will divide the physical land by the interest and give sole posession of that interest to each person. Ie here the brewery on the 10 acres of land would be split half and half for you and Alex. Court will consider if the Partician in Kind is feasible to do physically, if any parties are duly prejudiced. The courts will favor a Partician in Kind because it does not allow for the courts to forcably take away land from land owners. In contrast, the court may Partician by Sale. Here if a partician in kind is impracticable and benefits all parties by sale, they will sell the land at market value and give each you and Alex 50% of the money. Since, Alex has a personal deep love and interest in the brewery, the courts may favor a Partican in kind. Giving Alex half of the land that holds the main building, and you the other 50%. This is similar to the personhood theory in the case of Delfino. If in any way the physical partician in unequal to one side, the court will reauire an owltey payment. From the advantaged party to the other. For example this may happen in partician in kind of a beach house. if one person recieves the half that in on the beach, they are unequally favored in property value, over the person facing away from the water and to the street. The person with the ocean front will then pay owlty to even out the interest. 1b. Letter to Carl about his propety rights in the coins, growler, and coat. Dear Carl, First, let me speak to you about your property rights in the gold coind you found. Lost property is divided into 3 categories recognized by the courts, and one that was not adopted. (1) abandoned property, this is when the owner expressly and affirmatively gives up their legal right and title to the object. for example, think of when people through things in the garbage, it is a purposeful act to discard the object. The first finder of the abandoned property will get valid title to the property against all others and the true owner. (2) lost property, this is when the owner unconciously parts with their property and they can no longer find it. the first finder has valid posession against all others, even the true owner. for First, let me speak to you about your property rights in the gold coind you found. Lost property is divided into 3 categories recognized by the courts, and one that was not adopted. (1) abandoned to the property, this is when the owner expressly and affirmatively gives up their legal right and title object. for example, think of when people through things in the garbage, it is a purposeful act to discard the object. The first finder of the abandoned property will get valid title to the property against all others and the true owner. (2) lost property, this is when the owner unconciously parts with their property and they can no longer find it. the first finder has valid posession against all others, even the true owner. for example, think about walking down a street and your wallet fallowing out of your pocket, it was an inintentiohnal act, but now you can never find the wallet. Armory v Delamiree (3) Mislaid property, This is when the owner parts with their property purposefully, and then in the future forgets the property. For example, a person putting their wallet on a bar table in a resturant, they did it purposefully but then they walked away without taking it. Posession will NOT go to the first finder but to the owner of the establishment to have a duty of care to find the true owner. Some jusidictions will have laws that say the first finder can come back in X amount of time and claim the mislaid property as lost property. Corliss v Weiner (4) fourth is treasure trove, when a coin, bullion, are embedded into the ground for safe keeping, the true owner must not be available through research and a lot of time must go by. posessesion goes to the first finder. In your instance of the gold coins, I belive that the courts will see them as mislaid property. This is because the coins may have been out there wrapped in a bag with purpose, but the bag being up to 10 years old will be hard to find the owner. The courts through mislaid property will give posession to the owners of the property you found them, Alex and Brock. They will have duty of care to find the owner. In the instance of your growler, courts may find an implied bailment. You as bailor, and the brewery as bailee. Upon giving your growler to the worker he then gave you a ticket with your growlers number, an expected action to be to fill it and give back that same growler. the brewery as a Bailee would have a duty of care for your property. When they either misplaced it and or broke it they became liable for that damage. This is similar to the instance in the court case Hyatt Hotel, where the courts found an impled bailment when the owner of a car parked their car in the enclosed parking garage and got a ticket. The parking garage became an Bailee and when the car was stolen they were held liable. In the instane of your coat, the court may find that to be stolen property. It will most likely not raise to the level of an impled bailment, so the brewery may not be liable. It was a communal coat rack, where any person could take the coat. Thank you, bailment when the owner of a car parked their car in the enclosed parking garage and got a ticket. The parking garage became an Bailee and when the car was stolen they were held liable. In the instane of your coat, the court may find that to be stolen property. It will most likely not raise to the level of an impled bailment, so the brewery may not be liable. It was a communal coat rack, where any person could take the coat. Thank you, XX Ps. I hope the person whom took your coat returns it to the brewery, you should check the lost and found! C. Alex about his interest when conyed to David and Edward Alex, first lets discuss the convayence to David; ""so long as the property is used for residential use only, if it is ever used for non-residential uses, then to my two sons Frank and Fred."" This conveys to Davis a present posessory fee simple subject to executory limitation. If the condition of David not using it for residential pruposes then Fred and Frank use their future executory interest automatically to take the property from David. This is an executory limitation because it is a deafeasibly divested by not the grantor. However, David made the property a mixture of residential and commercial stores. from the languge it did explicitly state ""for residentialy uses ONLY"". Thus I believe the courts will allow Frank and Fred to take present posession of Davids 5 acres of land. Second, Edwards interest stated ""so long as the premises are never used to make IPA's, and if IPA's are made on the premises Alex has the right to re-enter and reclaim the premises."" Here Edward's interest is present posessory of a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. This is because the language of ""right or reentry"" is explicit and courts favor a FSSCS over a fee simple determinable. Alex, you have a future interest with right of entry / power of termination, upon the condition of IPA's being made on the premises. Now that Edward had made the decision to brew IPA's you may have to wait until they physically start, but once they do, you as grantor have right of entry to go in and take back posession of the 5 acres Edward currently has. "," Greenacre's legal title began with a Tenancy in the Entirety. This was held by both Andrew and Betty. The concurrant tenancy was created with the 4 unities; time, title, interest and posession, as decribed in detail above, and with the requirement of marriage. A tenancy in the entirety, like joint tenancy, there must be equal interest held by both parties, and allowance of posession by the whole. a Tenancy by the entirety cannot be severed by a unilateral conveyance. Only severed by divorce, mutually consented to, or death. There is also a right of survivorship. Even though Betty did not visit Greenacre this does not destroy her interest or sever the tenancy in entirety. Presence is not required, and does not constitute an ouster, an ouster needs to be affirmatively excluded by the other co tenants, and needs to try to gain entry and be denied. When an Ouster is made then rent can be sought after, Martin v Martin, the court held you can also get rent if there is an expressed agreement from all parties. When Andrew convyed his interest/ all of greenacre to Chris this did not sever the tenancy in the entirety. Andrew did not have the authority, including Betty consent, to convey the land. Thus Chris was a good faith purchaser from Andrew was acting under Color of title, Where an owner of a land has posession under a bad title unknowingly and fufuills other wise the elements of adverse posession. The elements of adverse posession are: Actual posession, open and notorious, exclusive, hostile and adverse, continuous for the statutory period. Here in new suffolk the statutory period for adverse possession is 10 years, and 7 plus years if the true owner has a disability, tacked on when the disability ends. Here neither Betty or Andrew has a known disbility. First, was the adverse posession within the years requirement for the statute. Yes, this is because Chris obtained the bad title in 2001, and then in privity ( affirmative conveyance to another in relationship) with his daughter in 2009, she possessed the land until 2019 when Betty finds out about the adverse posessors. This is a total or 18 years. this meets the statutory period. Second, was the adverse possession 'actual posession', this is true for Chris, he enlarged the house and visited in 8 weeks a year. Actual posession is when the AP uses the property as a true owner, sometimes as minimal as just being on the property. This is also true for Debbie, she starting living their full time in 2011. this is true for Chris and Debbie, they were on Third, was the adverse posession 'open and notorious', the land in an open fashion, where if the true owner was to come in they would see Chris and Debbie posessing the land. This is in conrast to the AP in Morango Cave, where the AP land was under ground Second, was the adverse possession 'actual posession', this is true for Chris, he enlarged the house and visited in 8 weeks a year. Actual posession is when the AP uses the property as a true owner, sometimes as minimal as just being on the property. This is also true for Debbie, she starting living their full time in 2011. Third, was the adverse posession 'open and notorious', this is true for Chris and Debbie, they were on the land in an open fashion, where if the true owner was to come in they would see Chris and Debbie posessing the land. This is in conrast to the AP in Morango Cave, where the AP land was under ground and a reasonable person would not tell if the cave went over into another land, let alone the true owner. This however, fallows the open and notorious conduct of the case Pimentals where they build a fence, shed, and gazeebo reasoning this to be open and notorious actions by the court. Fourth, was the adverse posession 'exlusive', yes, courts rule that exclusive means without the permission of the true owner. Here Chris was not on it with Andrew's or Betty's permission, instead he bought what he though was a valid title to the land. And during his usage he excluded neighbors from using the land in ways he did not permit. Chris and Debbie were acting as tru owners. Debbie expressely allowed the hunters to hunt. Fifth, was the adverse posession 'hostile and adverse' to the true owners. This is unclear in this instance. Both Chris and Debbie are acting as true owners, but under a bad title. They did not consiously know they were adversly posessing the land. Some jurisdictions look to the mindset of the adverse posessor. (1) AP mindset must be in 'good faith' that they truly though they were the true owners, this would help Debbies case. (2) AP mindet must be in 'bad faith' where the AP knows they are adverly posessing another lands and maliciously act, this will hurt Debbies case. (3) finally an objecting jurisdiction that does not look at mind set, instead focus on characteristics of exclusitivty, actual, open and notorious, and continuoius. This is the majority. This is in contrast to the case Cahill v Marrow, there the AP in a letter asked the true owners if she could buy the AP land. The courts reasoned this was not in line with exlcusive usage. Sixth, was the adverse posession 'continuous for the statutory period', this is true. Even though Chris and for a time Debbie did not live on the land year round, this is not required by courts. You can have conintued usage through just summers or vacations on the land. It is whatever use is parallel to that of true owners. Betty can make the case that Chris did not obtain valid title to Greenacre. This is because Andrew did not consult her and did not have the authority to convery the land, in the tenancy in the entirety. This was not a severance and so she can claim true title to Greenacre. However, this is countered by the Chris and for a time Debbie did not live on the land year round, this is not required by courts. You can have conintued usage through just summers or vacations on the land. It is whatever use is parallel to that true owners. Betty can make the case that Chris did not obtain valid title to Greenacre. This is because Andrew did not consult her and did not have the authority to convery the land, in the tenancy in the entirety. This was not a severance and so she can claim true title to Greenacre. However, this is countered by the arguement from Debbie claiming adverse posession. Debbie does meet all the requirements for Adverse posession and may win the case. This is because at any time durign the adverse posession, Betty could have come to Greenacre and brought claim to Green acre against Chris or Debbie before the statutrory period of AP was meet.

ccd4c7f7-60a4-48c3-9dbf-96e923a98d93, Oliver is the Grantor The first of his children to retire is the grantee The first of oliver's children to retire have contingent remainder in a life estate. They must be the first to retire to get the interest it is a condition precedent to them getting the interest. Their interest is contingent on them being the first to retire Oliver's nephew Robert has a vested remainder in life estate. Robert is alive at the time of conveyance and his interest in a life estate has vested. Oliver's grandchildren who reach the age of 25 have a vested remainder in fee simple subject to open. Vivian has already reached the age of 26 so the interest has vested because she is 26 at the time of the grant. Oliver is still alive at the time of the grant and could still have more children and more granchildren and the class has not yet closed. Because there are no words of duration we assume he is conveying to them a fee simple. Rules against perpetuities is henceforth RAP RAP applies to the contingent remainder that oliver's children have. This is void under the RAP because although once Oliver dies we will know who all of his children are and we will know whether their interest vests or fails in their lifetime there is a scenario where Oliver could have a child and everyone that was alive at the time of conveyance could die and then Oliver's childs interest may take longer than 21 years to vest. This is outside of the 21 year plus the life in being period of perpetutities. Robert's vested remainder in life estate is not subject to Rules againt Perpetuities Rules againt Perpetuities applies to Oliver's grandchildren who reach the age of 25 because we have to know whether the class will close or not for the interest to vest and pass under the RAP. This class is tied to the life of Oliver's children. This is void under RAP because after conveyance Oliver could have Robert's vested remainder in life estate is not subject to Rules againt Perpetuities Rules againt Perpetuities applies to Oliver's grandchildren who reach the age of 25 because we have to know whether the class will close or not for the interest to vest and pass under the RAP. This class is tied to the life of Oliver's children. This is void under RAP because after conveyance Oliver could have more children. Everyone alive at the time of conveyance could then die and then Oliver's children could have his granchildren 99 years later and their interest wouldn't vest until they turn 25. This violates the period of perpetuities which is the life in being plus 21 years. The class could remain open past this period. This interest is void under the Rule against Perpetuities. ," 1A. The first issue arises out of Brock and Alex's tenancy in common. The language of the deed although it is talking about the same possession of the same interest and is conveyed to both Alex and Brock in the same document at the same time would be found to grant them as tenants in common rather than joint tenants. Meaning their interests are divisable but they have equal interest in the same property. Alex does not want to sell their property interest but Brock does. Brock can take steps to divide their property interest similar to in the Delfino v. Valencias case. Brock can file for a partition by sale which will equitably divide the interest by selling it if their land is not able to be divided physically because of access roads etc. However courts typically favor a partition in kind where the land is physically divisiable. A partition by kind is also likely to be ordered by a court if Alex argues that his property interest is where his livelihood is and where he is living as well as operating his business and cannot be moved. That is similar to in the Delfino v. Valencias because Delfino was operating her garbage hauling business on the land and was also living there. The court found that because the land could be divided physically with ease that it should be done in that manner rather than by sale which would severely disrupt each property interest. So long as the land is able to be physically divided the court could grant Brock a partition in kind like in Delfino v. Valencias so Brock can sell his interest to the developer while Alex can remain in his livelihood using the brewery. When addressing the issue of their property interest as tenants in common the court may also use rules from the Martin v. Martin. In Martin v. Martin there 11 a dispute when Mr. Martin who was tenants in was common with his son was running a mobile home community on their shared property interest and wanted to get rent from the son. If Alex telling Brock to leave could constitute an ouster from the disrupt each property interest. So long as the land is able to be physically divided the court could grant Brock a partition in kind like in Delfino v. Valencias so Brock can sell his interest to the developer while Alex can remain in his livelihood using the brewery. When addressing the issue of their property interest as tenants in common the court may also use rules from the Martin v. Martin. In Martin v. Martin there was a dispute when Mr. Martin who was tenants in common with his son was running a mobile home community on their shared property interest and wanted to get rent from the son. If Alex telling Brock to leave could constitute an ouster from the property. If the court considers this to be an ouster then any profit made by alex on the shared property interest which Brock holds should be shared among them and Brock should get some of that profit. Brock can also bring action to sever the tenancy in common if Alex's manifesting of Brock to leave the property and not come back is considered to be an ouster. The next issue might be the difference in the worth of the property if it remains a brewery as opposed to it's worth if it is used by developers for condos. The court may look at the brewery as opposed to the possibility of development similar to in the Woodrick v. Wood case. In Woodrick v. Wood the court orders the family can raze the barn since it will improve the properties overall value and must pay for the barns worth. The court may use this holding to say that by allowing the developer to have the land and develop the property he would be improving the property more so than allowing the brewery to remain on the land. If the court compares the brewery with the barn in Woodrick v. Wood then they would likely allow Brock to sell the interest and pay off the difference of the Brewery's worth. The court would have to consider the developers condos to be ameliorative waste to follow along with this ruling. 1B. The next issue is the found property issue in Carl finding the gold coins on the brewery property and taking them and who has ownership over the coins. This is similar to in Corliss v. Wenner where Corliss finds gold coins underground on Wenner's property. New Suffolk is considered to be a common law state which like Illinois in Wenner does not recognize treasure trove. This is because treasure trove was not yet adopted by common law when common law was adopted by the united states. It never became adopted because in common law states we do not wish to encourage people to go digging on other peoples proeprty for treasure. This leads one to believe the coins are embedded property. Embedded property is typically in the earth or ground. Embedded property goes to the property owner. Therefore the Owners of the brewery would get the right to ownership over the coins. However if the court looks at this case similar to the Aviaton case where the money was put into a part of the plane and then the state which like Illinois in Wenner does not recognize treasure trove. This is because treasure trove was not yet adopted by common law when common law was adopted by the united states. It never became adopted because in common law states we do not wish to encourage people to go digging on other peoples proeprty for treasure. This leads one to believe the coins are embedded property. Embedded property is typically in the earth or ground. Embedded property goes to the property owner. Therefore the Owners of the brewery would get the right to ownership over the coins. However if the court looks at this case similar to the Aviaton case where the money was put into a part of the plane and then the plane was foreclosed upon they may say the gold coins are mislaid similar to the money in the wing of the plane. The reasons the court could find these to be mislaid is because they are in a hole in the wall and are wrapped in this bag which seems like someone whould have deliberately placed them there with the intention of coming back for them. If the coins are mislaid the Brewery still holds a right in them because the brewery is the most likely place the owner would come back and find the coins at. They are not presumed to be lost because they were likely not accidentally left in a hole in the wharehouse wall. They are also not abandoned because the act of putting them in a bag and burrying them appears to be carefully thought out and not similar to throwing them away without regard for them. Carl has no legal right to the Gold coins. The court will liekly find the gold coins are prima facia property of the brewery owners and were most similar to embedded property like in Wenner. They would not want to reward Carl for finding treasure on someone elses property. Another issue is the loss of Carl's growler. When Carl gives his growler to the employee's of the brewery and they give him a ticket in return with a specific number and tag this is similar to the actions in the case Allen v. Hyatt where the man drove his car into the garage and got a ticket when he parked his car that he had to return in order to remover his car from the garage. The court would likely find similar to in Hyatt that a bailment was created between Carl and the Brewery when he gives them his growler to fill in exchange for a ticket. Carl is the bailor and The brewery is the bailee and the court may even go further here than in Hyatt to say this wasn't just an implied bailment but it was an express bailment because he physically hands over the growler to the employees of the brewery in exchange for a ticket which he will then return to them in exchange for his growler back. It is very apparent that he is handing them voluntarily his possession and they are agreeing to maintain it in such a manner when they hand him a corresponding ticket. The court would likely find that because of this Carl is entitled to damages from the employee smashing his growler. A second bailment issue arises out of the coat rack in the brewery where carl has his coat stolen. The court will again look to the Hyatt case in determining is this is similar and if there was an implied bailment between Carl and the brewery when he entrusts their coat rack with his coat. The court however will likely find that this does not create a bailment because there was no true bailee that carl's handing them voluntarily his possession and they are agreeing to maintain it in such a manner when they hand him a corresponding ticket. The court would likely find that because of this Carl is entitled to damages from the employee smashing his growler. A second bailment issue arises out of the coat rack in the brewery where carl has his coat stolen. The court will again look to the Hyatt case in determining is this is similar and if there was an implied bailment between Carl and the brewery when he entrusts their coat rack with his coat. The court however will likely find that this does not create a bailment because there was no true bailee that carl's coat was entrusted with. Carl is not voluntarily giving his coat to anyone and the coat rack would not be similar to a coat check where implied bailment is made because Carl doesn't get a ticket or anything in exchange for placing his coat on the rack. The coat rack is not watched by anyone and theres no regulating whose coat goes on it and then comes off it. There doesn't seem to be a voluntary transfer of property to anyone which is necessary in creating a bailment. An issue could arise if the brewery later finds carls coat at the brewery somewhere carl may have placed it and forgot the coat will be similar to the purse in the barbershop of the McEvoy v. Medina case. The coat would be considered to be mislaid by Carl and the brewery would remain the brewery's property they would have a right of prima facia in the coat aka good against everyone except for it's true owner Carl because it is the most likely place Carl would return to retrieve his property. 1C. In his conveyance to David Developer Alex is the Grantor and David is a Grantee David Developer has a present possessory interest in fee simple subject to Executory limitation Frank and Fred have a shifting executory interest in fee simple. Alex's sons Frank and Fred can cut short the interest of david developer because he did not adhere to the conditions of the conveyance from Alex. Alex no longer holds interest in the property because there it is a fee simple so there is no reversion and there is no possibility in reverter or right of entry because the interest moves onto a 3rd party and does not go back to the grantor. In his conveyance to Edward Elixir Alex is the grantor and Edward is a grantee Edward has a fee simple determinable Alex has a right of re-entry the interest moves onto a 3rd party and does not go back to the grantor. In his conveyance to Edward Elixir Alex is the grantor and Edward is a grantee Edward has a fee simple determinable Alex has a right of re-entry Alex uses words of duration in his conveyance to Edward. This means Edward has a fee simple determinable. There is no 3rd party that this property is conveyed to at the time of conveyance which means the property goes back to Alex the grantor when Edward chooses to make IPA's. The way that this goes back to Alex matters. and comes down to the words of duration. This is similar to the issue in the Marenholz case where the court has to decide if the language created a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. If it is a fee simple determinable the grantor has a right of re- entry and the power of termination they must go to the court to get the property back. If the language created a condition subsequent the grantor would hold a possibility of reverter and automatically revert back to the grantor. Unlike Marenholz there is no amibiguity, the words so long as are unmistakeably words of duration and this is a fee simple determinable meaning Alex as the grantor has to bring action for a right of re-entry to take back the property interest. "," The first issue is Andrew selling Greenacre without his wife's permission, whom he hold a tenancy by entirety with. Had they been divorced their tenancy by entirety would have severed but because they are still married their tenancy by entirety remains in tact. Similar to the craft's in U.S. v. Craft, Betty and Andrew have a tenancy by entirety that is never severed because they never divorce or take action to sever it. They own greenacre as one interest. Andrew selling the property without Betty's permission is not allowed in a tenancy by entirety. Similar to how the court said in U.S. v. Craft that the husband could not unilaterally transfer the property. The issue following this is what interest does debbie now have because she was acting under false title passed on to her by her father Chris, whom Andrew wrongfully sold the property to. Chris was acting under color of title when he took on the Greenacre property and it was not a mistake. Similar to in the case of Tieu v. Morgan when Chris grants Greenacre to his daughter debbie they are in privity that they have title over the property. This means while Chris was on the property for 8 years his daughters time on the property tacks onto his time to meet the statutory period for title or possesion of ten years. This 10 years was satisfied in 2011 if the court rules similarly to Tieu v. Morgan and allows for Debbies time to tack onto her father Chris's time adversely possessing the property. For this property to be granted to Debbie she has to be able to claim that she adversely possessed it under color of title and meet all five elements of Adverse possession which are hostile, actual, continuous, open and notorious, and exclusive. The court could approach hostility in different ways depending on the good faith bad faith requirement. If the court is similar to the court in Maine in Dombowski case then Debbie will likely not be found to have been hostile because she would not pass the subjective test because she was not aware she was on someone elses property and did not have it in her mind she was taking property from someone else. The court in dombowski would not award property for a good faith mistake in thinking it was your property. However if the court follows a test similar to in Palmento v. Meidros where they awarded the good faith mistake of having the hedges and building a shed on someone elses property thinking it was there property then debbie can argue because it was a mistake and she thought the property was hers she meets the hostility requirement. The court may also follow a more objective test similar to in the Cahill v. Morrow case in Rhode Island where it doesn't matter what her mindset was as long as Debbie thought she had an objective claim of right in her title to the land. If the court acknowledges good faith mistake or follows the objective test of Cahill then they will say Debbie fulfills the requirement of hostility as to adverse possession. If they follow Dombowski and Maine they will say Debbie did not have the mindset of taking something that wasn't hers and does not fulfill the hostility requirement. The court will then examine the issue of if Debbie was in actual possession of the land she was she meets the hostility requirement. The court may also follow a more objective test similar to in the Cahill v. Morrow case in Rhode Island where it doesn't matter what her mindset was as long as Debbie thought she had an objective claim of right in her title to the land. If the court acknowledges good faith mistake or follows the objective test of Cahill then they will say Debbie fulfills the requirement of hostility as to adverse possession. If they follow Dombowski and Maine they will say Debbie did not have the mindset of taking something that wasn't hers and does not fulfill the hostility requirement. The court will then examine the issue of if Debbie was in actual possession of the land she was adversely possessing. To do this the court will examine how people in the area would typically use the land and if the way Debbie and her father Chris used it were in a way similar to someone who is actually in possession of such land would. The court may find that because this land was being used differently than others in the area used it, which was for hunting purposes, that it was not actual. However the court might also find that because they were actually posessing it even more so by building a permanent residence there rather than others in the area who only come seasonally for hunting purposes that they were in actual possession of the property. However the fact that Chris only used the property for eight weeks out of the year and didn't hunt there may be abnormal to the area and the court may rule he was never in actual possession because of that. The court will also look to at their use of only 2 acres of the 50 acre property rather than the whole and determine if that is a sufficient amount of use for a property like this one. The court will then examine the issue of continuous. Did Chris and then debbie continue possessing the land? The court will again look to see how others use the land and if similar to chris only using it 8 weeks a year is similar to how others would use the land and if it is enough to be considered continuous use. Because of the nature of this being land typically only used seasonally a court will likely find that 8 weeks could be sufficient enough time each year to constitute it as being continuous. Furthermore does Chris's time on the land tack on to his then conveyance of Debbies time to satisfy the 10 year statutory period of requirement for adverse possession. It is likely the court will find because Debbie and Chris were in privity that the time will tack on to satisfy the continuous posession and meet the 10 year requirement. There seems to be no disability here amongst Andrew or Betty therefore Chris and Debbie are only required to meet the 10 year stautory period. The next issue the court will examine is open and notorious and whether or not Debbie and Chris used the property in a manner that was open and notorius. This case is not like the Marengo Cave case because Betty could have driven by the land or checked on the property and it would have been easy to see that someone was openly and notoriously using 11 property through building a house for the permanent residence and cutting down trees and planting a garden. The use by Debbie and her father chris were well known to neighbors and others in the area and the true owner Betty would have been put are only required to meet the 10 year stautory period. The next issue the court will examine is open and notorious and whether or not Debbie and Chris used the property in a manner that was open and notorius. This case is not like the Marengo Cave case because Betty could have driven by the land or checked on the property and it would have been easy to see that someone was openly and notoriously using the property through building a house for permanent residence and cutting down trees and planting a garden. The use by Debbie and her father chris were well known to neighbors and others in the area and the true owner Betty would have been put on notice had attempted to visit or make any use of the property. This is not like the manillo v. Gorski case where there was a minor encroachment or the marengo case where it was hard to tell because it was underground use. Debbie was using the property in an extremely open and notorious manner by building on the property and making serious improvements to the property. The final element issue to examine is exclusive. It is likely Betty will argue that the use of the property was not exlcusive because Debbie and her father Chris allowed people to come on the property to hunt. However the property here is similar to the exclusiveness in the Tieu v. Morgan case where it can only be used by others with permission from the posessor. Both Debbie and Chris set limitations on the permissive use of the property it was not open for use without their express permission and the use by others was under conditions set forth by them. Exlcusivity was also an issue in Marengo v. Cave because the property was being used underground by the adverse possessor and above ground by the rightful owner. That is not similar to this case. Debbie, and Chris before her, were the only ones using the property and others who used the property had to do so with their permission. They were able to exlcude others from their property. A court will likely find that because Debbie and her father Chris acted under color of title to possess the 50 acres of Greenacre and were the only ones actually and exclusively occupying the property continuously for the statutory period in an open and notorius manner that they have adversely possessed all 50 acres so long as the hosiltity requirement is met in this particular state. Betty was not in actual possession of any part of the property which is why a court would likely give Debbie all 50 acres rather than just the two she used. Had Betty been on some other part of the property and not noticed Debbie then Debbie's color of title would not be enough to tack on all 50 acres she would only get the two acres she was using. Unlike in Cahill v. Morrow Debbie used the property and never questioned her claim of right in the property. Debbie all 50 acres rather than just the two she used. Had Betty been on some other part of the property and not noticed Debbie then Debbie's color of title would not be enough to tack on all 50 acres she would only get the two acres she was using. Unlike in Cahill v. Morrow Debbie used the property and never questioned her claim of right in the property. ",472,2206,1765
351e0d0e-9901-4878-9d31-decad062eb91," The first of Oliver's children to retire will have a life estate which could be either Carla or Connor. However, since they are both still working at the moment the conveyance takes, neither of them are yet entitled to the life estate as included in the deed because one must retire in order for their interest to become valid. Oliver's nephew, Robert has a contingent remainder in a life estate as proven by the language ""for life"" following the death of either Carla or Connor (whoever is first to retire). Victor, Oliver's grandchild, has a vested remainder in fee simple subject to partial divestment because he has surpassed the age of 25 as written in the grant. This is a future interest as he must wait for the life estate of Robert to terminate. The language of ""To my grandchildren"" with no condition or lifespan attach indicates a fee simple. Vivian has a contingent remainder in fee simple because she also has a future interest however she has not yet turned 25 and thus must wait for her interest to vest. Oliver Owner does not have a future interest because he granted a fee simple to his grandchildren that turn 25 and since Robert has already turned 25 it will go to Robert's heirs rather than back to Oliver. The Rule against perpetuities states that the interest must vest within 21 years of the life in being at the creation of the grant. Being that the first interest is contingent upon retirement it will not necessarily vest within the lifetime of the last life in being (Vivian) as Carla or Connor could work until they die having never retired. However, if we are avoiding the wait-and-see approach then we can determine that since they are not retired right now at the moment of conveyance the interest is void under the Rule against Perpetuities. The interest to the first of his children to retire could be written as: ""To my first born child for life but if one child retires before the other, then to that child for life"" "," 1A. Brock has brought to me an issue of the rights tenants in common have in regards to selling property they are a co-tenant of. Alex Apple and Brock are2tenants in common. Tenants in common means that they both own fractional shares of the property and can do as they please with their fraction as long as it Part III: Essay Question 1 1A. Brock has brought to me an issue of the rights tenants in common have in regards to selling property they are a co-tenant of. Alex Apple and Brock are tenants in common. Tenants in common means that they both own fractional shares of the property and can do as they please with their fraction as long as it does not interfere with the use of the other co-tenant. A co-tenant cannot require another co-tenant to pay them rent for any reason (even if they are using their fraction of the property) unless they have undergone an ouster. An ouster would be if one co-tenant leaves the property for any reason the other co-tenant would be required to pay them the market price rental value of their fraction of property. Martin v. Martin. If the brothers had agreed to be joint tenants their rights to the property would differ. It is fair to note that the piece of paper Alex wrote the grant on used language that could be construed to mean a joint tenancy with his use of the word ""jointly"" however, as the courts tend to lean towards a tenancy in common when there is ambiguity, I will do the same in providing my legal advice. The leading difference between joint tenancy and tenancy in common is that in a joint tenancy, there is a right of ""survivorship"" which states that if one joint tenant dies the other tenant receives there share of the property. Harms v. Sprague. Tenancy by the entirety would not apply in this case as it only applies to married individuals. U.S. v. Craft. One way to severe a tenancy in common is through partition. There are two types of partition, partion by sale and partion in kind though partition of kind is generally favored by courts as it does not force anybody to sell land that they do not want to. Delfino v. Valencis. Partition by sale occurs when the court decides it is most favorable to sell the entire property and split the profits up in accordance with the fractional shares the owners both had. This is mostly decided by courts in the event that splitting the property up could be of substantial loss to the co-tenant. Partition in Kind is when each co-tenant is granted the option to physically separate their ownership of the land and do as they please with the physical space that has been assigned to their part ownership. In this case, the real estate developer stated that he wished to purchase the warehouse and the 10 acres of land to develop it into condos. He does not discuss whether he would accept a smaller portion of the land or which aspect of the property would be most useful to him (the warehouse or the open land). In the case that the real estate developer would negotiate to perhaps offer a still significant amount of money for the open land and Alex were to agree to sell the land but keep the warehouse where he operates the brewery a partion in kind may be suitable for Brock to get the payment he is seeking. However, if the real estate developer totally scraps the offer if he does not get the entirety of the In this case, the real estate developer stated that he wished to purchase the warehouse and the 10 acres of land to develop it into condos. He does not discuss whether he would accept a smaller portion of the land or which aspect of the property would be most useful to him (the warehouse or the open land). In the case that the real estate developer would negotiate to perhaps offer a still significant amount of money for the open land and Alex were to agree to sell the land but keep the warehouse where he operates the brewery a partion in kind may be suitable for Brock to get the payment he is seeking. However, if the real estate developer totally scraps the offer if he does not get the entirety of the property then Brock may file for a partion by sale which would force his brother to give up the brewery he holds so dearly and in that case Brock would split the proceeds from the real estate with his brother which would potentially be the same amount as selling his share and allowing his brother to remain on the property. Brock has a valid argument for a partition in kind being that he does not want to operate the brewery with his brother anymore, there is 10 acres of land (aside from the small portion the warehouse is on) that he could use to compromise with his brother as well as the real estate developer and he could still have his pay out. However, on the flip side Alex could claim that he refuses to sell the 10 acres or the real estate developer could take back the offer making it contingent upon the property in it's entirety. I would advise Brock to negotiate with his brother that Alex apple could keep the warehouse and Brock could sell the remaining acres to the real estate developer. Then Brock must negotiate with the developer to determine what his pay would be for selling the reduced plot of land without the warehouse. If both are willing to negotiate I think he has an excellent case for partition in kind as a severance from the tenancy in common he shares with his brother. 1B. The gold coins represent an issue with found property. In regards to the gold coins Carl found we reference the different types of found property. The different types of found property include abandoned, lost, mislaid, and treasure trove. Abandoned indicates an intentional disregard for property in which the finder has the most superior title. Lost property indicates unintentionally leaving property somewhere and not knowing where it is the superior title here is within the true owner then the first finder has a more superior title to the subsequent finders. Amelorie. Mislaid property is when someone intentionally puts their property down somewhere but forgets where in which the true owner has the most superior title followed by the individual who owns the property where it was found then the subsequent finders. Mcavoy v. Medina. Treasure trove references buried goods that are found later, here the finder holds superior title. For the gold coins that Carl found I believe the court would consider in which the finder has the most superior title. Lost property indicates unintentionally leaving property somewhere and not knowing where it is the superior title here is within the true owner then the first finder has a more superior title to the subsequent finders. Amelorie. Mislaid property is when someone intentionally puts their property down somewhere but forgets where in which the true owner has the most superior title followed by the individual who owns the property where it was found then the subsequent finders. Mcavoy v. Medina. Treasure trove references buried goods that are found later, here the finder holds superior title. For the gold coins that Carl found I believe the court would consider them mislaid and therefore they belong first and foremost to the true owner but then the owner of the property on which they were found. Benjamin v. tindl... Therefore, the coins would now be the property of Alex Apple and Brock because they own the warehouse where they were found. The growler represents a bailment issue. Bailments are when one individual temporarily allows another individual to possess their property. An example would be a landlord/tenant relationship or a car in a car garage. Allen v. Hyatt. When an individual temporarily gives up that ownership the temporary possessor is liable for any damage that occurs to it while it is in their possession. A court will also consider if it is reasonable that the individual taking temporary possession was reasonably aware that they would be liable for the property. In this case, given that Carl was given a ticket of proof that it belonged to him originally he had reason to believe they were taking care of it and he did not have to closely follow to ensure that nobody broke it without telling him. Like in Allen v. Hyatt, the parking garage attendant provided Allen with a ticket for his vehicle and therefore put him under reasonable belief that good care would be taken of his vehicle. However, to counter this argument it is likely that Alex Apple and Brock (the owners of the brewery) do not consider this as big of a responsibility as handling people's cars and homes. They could also argue that because filling up a growler is a relatively quick process and since they probably process tons a day it is the responsibility of the owner of the growler to watch for it to make sure it is not given to the wrong customer. Despite this argument I think Carl's will prevail if he argues that he temporarily handed his ownership rights of the growler over to the brewery and therefore they are liable for it having gone missing and should provide him with damages. Because Carl provides me with very little detail in regards to the coat it is likely that his if the true owner of found property at this point (unknown whether or not it has been found). If Carl were to tell me where he thinks he left it, or if he has no idea that would be helpful in dictating whether it was lost or mislaid. However, whether it was lost or mislaid he still holds the superior title. If Carl were to find the finder of his coat he would have the most superior title in being the true owner and would be able to get his coat back. This could get more complicated if his jacket is lost/mislaid multiple times and therefore it has acquired multiple finders in which case one of the finders would most likely have to file for indemnification. This issue is difficult to give adequate advice on as there is little explanation of the of found property at this point (unknown whether or not it has been found). If Carl were to tell me where he thinks he left it, or if he has no idea that would be helpful in dictating whether it was lost or find mislaid. However, whether it was lost or mislaid he still holds the superior title. If Carl were to the finder of his coat he would have the most superior title in being the true owner and would be able to get his coat back. This could get more complicated if his jacket is lost/mislaid multiple times and therefore it has acquired multiple finders in which case one of the finders would most likely have to file for indemnification. This issue is difficult to give adequate advice on as there is little explanation of the circumstances in which Carl can no longer find his jacket. 1C In the deed selling the 5 acres of land to David Developer, Alex conveys to David a Fee Simple subject to Executory limitation and then provides Frank and Fred with executory interests in fee simple. A fee simple to executory limitation provides a third party with the ability to cut short the property interest proceeding it. In this case, if David is to use the property for anything other than residential uses Alex Apple's sons will intersect that interest. Fred and Frank hold an executory interest in fee simple because they can cut short the interest of David. The Rule against Perpituities applies to contingent remainders, executory interests, and vested remainders subject to open. In this instance Frank and Fred have executory interests in fee simple and under the Rule against Perpetuities this is valid because at the time of conveyance it is clear that David is intending on using the property for residential purposes. In the deed for the sale of the other 5 acres with the warehouse and brewery facilities Alex conveys to Edward Elicis an possessory interest in fee simple subject to condition subsequent. He also provides himself with a future interest of re-entry if Edward makes IPA's on the premesis. It is clear Edward has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because fee simple is provided by the language ""and his heirs"" and the condition is to never make the IPAs on the premises. However, the language is misleading because the language ""so long as"" indicates a fee simple condition determinable however the right of re- entry is a future interest that only follows a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. The court, and as I will do here, leans towards fee simple subject to condition subsequent in moments where the language is ambiguous as it is here. The legal claim Alex has against David is simply allowing the property interest to move to his sons Frank and Fred. In the case of Edward he would have the right to enter and reclaim the premises if he so chooses as they have both violated the conditions stated in their deeds. "," Debbie can claim color of title for adverse possession. Color of title is when you in good faith believe you own a piece of property however your title is actually based on a faulty deed. In this case, Betty's signature being forged by her husband would make the deed invalid. Color of title is a valid argument for proving adverse possession. Adverse possession is achieved through 1. actual, physical posession 2. open/notorious ownership as to put the true owner on notice 3. exclusive as to the original owners and others, 4. continuous 5.hostile; knowing you dont have possession (good faith/bad faith/objective varies between jurisdictions). Cahill v. Morrow. Manillo. Pimenthal. It is also required that the statue of limitations has been satisfied which in this case it has not been if you only consider the time from where Debbie started living there (exactly 10 years-- Betty could still file). However, you can combine your years of adverse possession with the previous owner's years if there is a mutual agreement through privity which, seeing as it was her father, is implied here and thus her ownership really began in 2001. However, the statue of limitations has not expired on her adverse possession claim and therefore Betty can still file for quiet title to regain her claim to the property. In addition, Debbie only just moved there ""continuously"" as dictated by the requirements for adverse possession in 2011 which is only 8 years when the statue requires 10. Adverse possession is not honored unless all of the requirements are fulfilled. Because all of the requirements of Adverse Possession are not satisfied in this case I believe that a court would find that Betty has the more superior title to the land. ",348,2263,288
124ca124-867d-48db-9bff-2aaae7f02849," The first issue is identifying, prior to examining the rule against perpetuities, the future interests and present estates of those alive currently. Oliver, (and if Oliver dies, oliver's estate) has the fee simple subject to executory limitation because at any moment one of his children coould retire and take the property for their life. Connor and Carla both have an executory interest in life estate because the moment one of them retires, the property becomes theres. Nephew Robert has an indefeasibly vested remainder in life estate because he need do nothing to get the life estate except wait patiently for the death of the first child of Oliver to retire. Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple because any grand child of Oliver may, at some point in the future, satisfy the condition of reaching 25. Vivan has an executory interest in fee simple because as soon as she turns 25 she will ""steal"" a fraction of Victor's vested remainder. We also must identify unborn person's interests and estates prior to examining the rule against perpetuities. the unborn children of Oliver have an executory interest, similar to Connor and Carla, because one of his unborn children coould retire and take the property for their life from Oliver. Secondly, the unborn grandchildren of Oliver have an executory interest, similar to Vivan, because they could reach 25 and steal a fraction of Victor's (and hopefully vivan's if she is still alive) vested remainder subject to open in fee simple. Lastly, I would like to point out that Oliver does not have a reversion in fee simple because nothing can prevent Victor or his issues from inheriting all or some of the fee simple. Next, we must examine the rule against prerpetuities for every estate and interest. The rule against perpetuities exists to limit dead hand control. Firstly, rule against perpetuities only applies to executory interests, vested remaniders subject to open, and contigent remainders. Secondly, if one of those listed interest could take longer than the life of someone living at the time of the grant, otherwise known as a validating life, plus 21 years than the interest is invalid and will be stricken unless the rule of convenience can save the interest, which I will discuss later. So firstly, Oliver's (or if Oliver dies his estate's) present possession of the fee simple subject to executory limitation is not subject to the rule against perpetuities because it is not one of the previously listed future interests. interest could take longer than the life of someone living at the time of the grant, otherwise known as a validating life, plus 21 years than the interest is invalid and will be stricken unless the rule of convenience can save the interest, which I will discuss later. So firstly, Oliver's (or if Oliver dies his estate's) present possession of the fee simple subject to executory limitation is not subject to the rule against perpetuities because it is not one of the previously listed future interests. Connor and Carla's interest is subject to the Rule against Perpetuities because it is an executory interest, but will nessecarly fail or vest within there life time because a dead person can not retire so it is not void under the Rule against Perpetuities by itself. Secondly, the executory interest of Oliver's unborn children is subject to the rule against perpetuities because it it is an executory interest. We must examine if there are any situation in which it will not fail or vest within the life of someone living at the time of the grant plus 21 years. For example, assume the grant happened in 2000, Oliver could have a new child, Sandy, in 2001. Then everyone on the face of the earth besides Sandy could die in 2002. Sandy could retire in 2099. Obviously, this took longer than a validating life plus 21 years. Under situations like these, where a single grant is valid for some but invalid for others, we look to the rule of convenience. The rule of convience states that if a vested remainder is subject to open, than anyone than alive may be able to satisfy it but we close the interest to anyone unborn. here, the executory interest in it's entirity is void because the rule of convience can not save it, so the condition ""to the first of my children to retire,"" would be striken. Next, Robert's indefeasibly vested remainder in life estate is not subject to the rule against perpetuities because it is not one of the previously listed future interests. Victor, Vivan and any unborn grandchildren of Oliver's interests are subject to RAP because they are all on the previously listed future interests. Firstly, none of them might vest within the validating life plus 21 years because, for example, a grandchild of Oliver may be born after the grant, everyone else in the world could die, and then that child could turn 25. Again, in situations like these we turn to the rule of convience, because Victor's interests are vested even though other's are not. The rule of convience states that if a vested remainder is subject to open, than anyone than alive may be able to satisfy it but we close the interest to anyone unborn. So here, victor and Vivian's interest are valid under the rule against perpetuities, but executory interests of the unborn grandchildren are valid under the rule against perptuities. world could die, and then that child could turn 25. Again, in situations like these we turn to the rule of convience, because Victor's interests are vested even though other's are not. The rule of convience states that if a vested remainder is subject to open, than anyone than alive may be able to satisfy but it we close the interest to anyone unborn. So here, victor and Vivian's interest are valid under the rule against perpetuities, but executory interests of the unborn grandchildren are valid under the rule against perptuities. Re writing the grant, we would say ""to my nephew Robert for life, then to my grandchildren, Victor and/or Vivan, who reach the age of 25"" "," A. Hello Brock, So the first issue you have is whether you can force the sale to the developer. Based on the decree the deed, you are very clearly tenants in common, which is the preference of most courts. Given that you and your brother both own half, there is no way for you to force the sale without seeking assistance from a court. It sounds like what you would like to do is force a partition in kind, similar to what happened in Delfino v. Vealencis. The first thing to note is that courts really prefer partions by kind, a dividing of the land into two seperate estates, because they would like to avoid evicting owners from their land if possible, although often at the trial court level a partions by kind are simply easier. To convince a court to do a partion by sale, we have to show them that a partion by kind is made impossible by the nature of the land, a partion by sale is in the best interest (not just economic interest) of all the parties, and that it would not prejudice any of the tenants in common. the first point, that a partion by kind is made impossible by the nature of the land, is probably not difficult to prove if the brewery takes up the entire 10 acres of the land. if it doesn't than it would be quite easy for Alex to show the court a possible option of how to divide the land fairly. the second and third issue, that we have to show that it is in the interest of all the parties and doesn't prejudice any party, go hand in hand. If we can convince new suffolk that the interest should be purely based on economic merits, than we have a very strong case that it is in the interest of all the parties. However, most courts have decided that it is not just economic and Alex yelling that he loves the place clearly demonstrates that it is not in highest his interest to have a partition by sale and sell to the 11 bidder. Given that, I believe a partion by sale would be unlikely to happen if we went to court. have to show that it is in the interest of all the parties and doesn't prejudice any party, go hand in hand.

Given that, I believe a partion by sale would be unlikely to happen if we went to court. The other option, a partion by kind, is likely not going to be in your favor. Alex has spent a lot of time investing in the property, and much like in Delfino v. Vealencis, may get to keep the part of the property that he improved if there is a partion by kind. Unlike in Delfino v. Vealencis, however, you became cotenants with your brother after the improvements were made, so i would say it will be totally up to the court to decide how to partition the land, with an equal chance to both of you who gets the part with the brewery on it. the only thing that may sway the judge that Adam should get the half of the land with the brewery is that he has obviously more of an interest in keeping it than you and it would greatly predjudice him to give him the part of the land without the brewery. Assuming you got the partition by kind, you could sell whatever estate you recive to the developer, assuming they will take half of the 10 acres, for a quick cash injection. However, a better, more long term investment would be to charge your brother rent. Much like in Martin v. Martin, you could attempt to seek an accounting and collect rent from your brother. He has clearly ousted you by saying ""don't come back"" and, as in all situations between cotenants where one ousts the other, you could charge him market value rent for the whole ten acres (cut in half). As long as you continue to pay carrying charges (taxes, morgatages, anything that would cause you to lose the property) you could collect rent from Adam without doing anything related to brewing beer. Although you wouldn't recieve any of the profits from the beer brewing itself, this is a great long term investment and my advice would be to go to a court and seek an accounting. B. Hello Carl, The first issue is the coins. To determine who owns the coins we have to decide what category of finder's law they fall into. Firstly, I'd like to point out that the building was only built in 2001, so it's unlikely that there is any argument that the coins were treasure trove or embedded, as was disscussed in Coriliss v. Wenner, because in all likely hood the true owner of the coins is still alive. That leaves us B. Hello Carl, The first issue is the coins. To determine who owns the coins we have to decide what category of finder's law they fall into. Firstly, I'd like to point out that the building was only built in 2001, so it's unlikely that there is any argument that the coins were treasure trove or embedded, as was disscussed in Coriliss v. Wenner, because in all likely hood the true owner of the coins is still alive. That leaves us with Lost, Mislaid and Abandonded. Lost property is unintentionally left behind property, much like the purse in McAvoy v. Medina, and goes to the finder. Mislaid is property that is intentionaly left somewhere but later forgotten, much like the money in Benjamin v. Linder Aviation, and goes to the owner of the property on which it was found. Lastly, abandonded property is property that is intentional discard and the true owner has abandonded all claim to it, which goes to the finder and gives the finder a superior claim to the property against the whole world. Our best argument is that the coins are Lost or Abandonded, because then you will get the coins. Because the coins were deliberatly behind a wall and neatly placed in a bage, I would say that a court would be unlikely to hold that the coins were lost. Here, I think Adam and Brock, the owners of the brewery, would have a very good argument that someone intentionally left the coins there and then later forgot about them, which would mean they would get the coins. Our best argument is that someone dilleberately put the coins in the crack in the wall in an effort to discard them, and this would be great for you because you would have a claim to the coins even against the original owner. Let us really quickly discuss the difference between treasure trove and embedded, just in case the court unexpecdtly decides that enough time has passed where the true owner of the coins is likely dead. As seen in Corliss v. Wenner, States usually only apply one or the other and not both. This is because the classification for both is roughly the same (stuff left behind by someone so long ago that there is virtually no chance they will come and retrieve it.) Originally, treasure trove went to the king, but since the rule was adopted by the states, treasure trove goes to the finder and embedded goes to the owner of the land. Much like in Coriliss, Adam and Brock would want to argue that New suffolk should embrace embedded because it prevents fortune hunters from tresspassing with the intent of finding and taking treasure. Here, however, we have the better argument ins saying not enough time has passed for either embedded or treasure trove to be applicable. The second issue is the growler. Similar to Allens v. Hyatt Regency Hotel, if we want to recover damages for the growler, we have to argue that when you hand the growler to the bartender, a bailment was created. A bailment is between two people when one temporarly gives another possession of their property under the assumption that the property will be taken care of. The majority in Allens said that a embedded because it prevents fortune hunters from tresspassing with the intent of finding and taking treasure. Here, however, we have the better argument ins saying not enough time has passed for either embedded or treasure trove to be applicable. The second issue is the growler. Similar to Allens v. Hyatt Regency Hotel, if we want to recover damages for the growler, we have to argue that when you hand the growler to the bartender, a bailment was created. A bailment is between two people when one temporarly gives another possession of their property under the assumption that the property will be taken care of. The majority in Allens said that a bailment is created when the bailor reasonablly expected that the bailee would protect the property. The minority believed that a bailment is created when the bailor ""took control"" of the property"". Recieving a ticket for the growler is great evidence that a bailment was created because it shows that you, and a ressonable person have, expected to get the growler back in one piece. Additionally, the fact that you handed the bartender the growler shows that they ""took control"" of the growler while they had it. under either test, I believe we have a very strong case that a bailment was created. The brewery's only argument, which is week, is that unlike in Allens, you did not pay any money and thus a bailment was not created. The last issue is the jacket. Here, we will again be testing whether a bailment was created. I think the fact that the hooks are available to any customer who walks off the street makes our argument significantly weaker than with the growler. It's not clear that at any point anyone handled your jacket or ""took control"" of it. We would have to ask New Suffolk to apply the Majority's test in Allens and state that a resonable person would have expected the brewery to have kept an eye on the coat. Here, unlike in Allens, however, there is no guard, the hooks are not enclosed and guard from the public, you didnt pay for them to watch the coat and you did not recieve any sort of confirmational ticket that would lead someone to expect that they were watching the coat. Our only hope to recover damages would be to find the thief and ask for the coat back or to sue for damages. C. Hello Alex, So let's analysis these two grants you gave seperatly. First, the grant you gave to David has to seperate parts. David has a possessory fee simple subject to executory limitation (that means he has full control of the land but a third party, in this case Frank and Fred, can take the land if he fails to meet the C. Hello Alex, So let's analysis these two grants you gave seperatly. First, the grant you gave to David has to seperate parts. David has a possessory fee simple subject to executory limitation (that means he has full control of the land but a third party, in this case Frank and Fred, can take the land if he fails to meet the conditions you set.) Frank and Fred have an executory interest in fee simple because, at any point if David doesn't meet the conditions you set they can take the land automatically, without having to go to court. Courts have an interest in limiting dead hand control so they have made something called the rule against perpetuities (also called RAP). This prevents any interest that would take longer than the length of a validating life (someone at the time of the grant) plus 21 years to either vest or fail. RAP only applies to executory interests, contigent remainders, and vested remainders subject to open. So Frank and Fred's interests are subject to RAP. They also are void at the moment of the grant under RAP because David's issue may fail to meet the condition far off into the future. A court would most likely strick their interest and any phrases that don't make grammatical sense after doing so, based on the grammer rule, and would make the grant ""To David, so long as the property is used for residential uses only."" This would turn David's interest into a Fee simple determinable, and would give you a possibility of reverter which is automatic. This means, because David is not ussing the property only for residential uses, you already automatically own the land! Next, let us examine your grant to Edward. First, your grant to edward has langugue that is both terms of duration (so long as) and terms of condition (but if) so it is ambigous as to whether Edward has a fee simple subject to condition subsiquent or a fee simple determinable. A court would probably follow Marenholz and say that society has a preference for a Fee simple subject to condition subsiquent because this limits the chance of tenants being evicted. If a new suffolk court decides to adobt that rule, than Edward has a fee simple subject to condition subsiquent and you have a right of entry. Although this is not automatic, all we need to do is go to court and seek an enforcement ant the property will be yours once again. Once again, RAP only applies to executory interests, contigent remainders, and vested remainders subject to open, so it is not at issue here. entry. Although this is not automatic, all we need to do is go to court and seek an enforcement ant the property will be yours once again. Once again, RAP only applies to executory interests, contigent remainders, and vested remainders subject to open, so it is not at issue here. "," Firstly, we should see if adverse possession works in this case. In all states, adverse possession requires the possession to be open and notorious, Actual, exclusive, Hostile, and Continous for the 10 years required by the statue. Additionally, like in Tieu v. Morgan, some states require the actor to have Good faith because those states are only interested in rewarded actors whom are mistaken. Further, like in dombkowski, some states require that actors have bad faith, stating that if a adverse possessor's claim to the land is conditional on they being the owner, than the claim is not hostile. Lastly, some states require adverse possesors to have paid taxes on the property. We should also state that Chris alone did not adversly possess the land because he only was alive on it for 9 years, shorter than the statue requires. First, lets examine if adverse possession as to the cabin is satisfied. Here, unlike in Tieu v. Morgan, Betty could argue very nicely that debbie would not be able to tack Chris's time on the property for her adverse possession claim because there was a two year gap between 2009 and 2011 in which neither actually possessed the property. If the court believed that then 8 years, (2011 to 2019) would not be enough time to satisfy the statue. If Debbie would have to argue that she acted as a resonable owner when getting an estate in testate and should be able to tack Chris's possession because any resonable owner would take time to move to the property previously owned by someone else. She probably had to sell her current house, maybe find a new job, and all that takes time. Although there is an argument as to whether or not Chris's possession was continous (because 11 he would only be there for fishing season) it's really not at issue because either Debbie can prove she was a continous user from 2009 to 2019 or she fails the adverse possession claim. Tacking isn't really nessecary. enough time to satisfy the statue. If Debbie would have to argue that she acted as a resonable owner when getting an estate in testate and should be able to tack Chris's possession because any resonable owner would take time to move to the property previously owned by someone else. She probably had to sell her current house, maybe find a new job, and all that takes time. Although there is an argument as to whether or not Chris's possession was continous (because he would only be there for fishing season) it's really not at issue because either Debbie can prove she was a continous user from 2009 to 2019 or she fails the adverse possession claim. Tacking isn't really nessecary. Assuming that Debbie could convinced the court that the use was continous from the time of her father's death to 2019, she would than have to argue that it was open and notorious. Although she built a house, Betty would have an argument that living in a cabin constructed by Andrew was not ""open an notorious"" because the modifications Chris made were not visible from the outside. However, Debbie was actually on the land full time (again for most of it, but for the purposes of this disscussion we will assume continous is satisfied), so all a reasonable owner would have had to do was look inside the cabin. This is far different from Marengo Caves v. Ross because Betty had access to the cabin and could have checked at any moment. Actual is easily satisfied because Debbie lived on the property and was there most of the ten years. For the cabin, there is no doubt that Debbie was excluding others because they had to ask permission onto the property. (we will revist this when it comes to the rest of the land and color of title.) Hostile is also easily satisfied because there is no doubt that Debbie, who recieved a deed from her father, believed she was the true owner of the property. Although the issue of continuity is still up in the air, Debbie would have to convince New Suffolk to adopt a good faith requirment, which is in an overwhelming majority of states. This requirment rewards though who make an honest mistake, which is what Debbie did here. Betty, however, could argue that the court should apply Maine's bad faith requirment, which would harm Debbie's claim that she was acting Hostile and adverse. Lastly, it is not stated in the fact pattern but given that she was living on the property without being evicted and Betty had forgotten about the property in 2019, I am going to assume that Debbie has been paying the taxes on this land. I believe that Debbie has a very legitimate claime to the cabin itself if she can prove continuity Next we must examine the rest of the land around the cabin. Debbie is probably acting under color of title because she has a deed that a resonable person would have relied on. Carl would have also believed that the fraudlent deed was authentic, so if tacking is an issue, Carl also satisfies that. Color of property without being evicted and Betty had forgotten about the property in 2019, I am going to assume that Debbie has been paying the taxes on this land. I believe that Debbie has a very legitimate claime to the cabin itself if she can prove continuity Next we must examine the rest of the land around the cabin. Debbie is probably acting under color of title because she has a deed that a resonable person would have relied on. Carl would have also believed that the fraudlent deed was authentic, so if tacking is an issue, Carl also satisfies that. Color of title gives an adverse possesor, if they satisfy all the other elements, the whole property unless the true owner is also living on the property. Here, Betty is not on the property, so if, as i believe she will, Debbie has adversly possessed the property than she gets the whole property, not just the cabin. Lastly, I would like to talk about joint tenancy in the entirity. Although this sale is not nessecary for Debbie's adverse possession of the cabin or the land, a court may decide that it is important to dissect what exactly the timeline of the estate was. Joint Tenants in the entirity need the permission of both parties to alienate the property, which means that in 2001, Andrew was only able to sell his half. Joint tenants in the entirity, however, is split upon death, which happen in 2004. At this time, assuming that the sale of the property was fraudlent as stated, Betty became the owner of the property in it's entirety. As we have disscussed, tacking is not as issue because either Debbie was either in continous possession from 2009 to 2019, in which case I believe she has adversly possessed it in 2019, or she was not continous for more than the statue requires. Additionally, if Debbie or Chris gathered resources (fish or wood) from the land then some states that believe that the adverse possession begins will allow the previous owner to seek damages from those resources prior to the adverse possession. Other states believe that, for the purpose of recovering damages from resources gathered from the property, we should count the adverse possession as the date of the first entry, which assuming tacking would be 2001.

Robert has an indefeasibly vested remainder in a life estate. Victor has a vested remainder in a fee simple subject to open. Vivian and any unborn grandchildren have an executory interest in a fee simple. Oliver has a fee simple subject to executory limitation as his interest can be cut short whenever Connor or Carla retire. Oliver Owner's fee simple is not subject to the Rule against Perpetuities because possessory interest are not subject to the rule. The first child to retire has a contingent remainder as a precedent condition must be satisfied before they can take possession. The first child to retire is subject to the Rule against Perpetuities, but it is valid. The first child to retire requirement will either vest or fail within a life in being plus 21 years. Robert has an indefeasibly vested remainder as he cannot lose his remainder. Roberts future interest is not subject to the Rule against Perpetuities as it is indefeasibly vested. The 3 future interest subject to the rule against perpetuities are contingent remainders, executory interests, and vested remainders subject to open. Victor has a vested remainder subject to open as he has satisfied to contingency, but his interest can be diluted by additional children entering the class. The remaining children have an executory interest as their interest can partially divest Victor's interest. Victor's vested remainder subject to open is subject to the Rule against perpetuities, along with the executory interest of Vivian and any unborn grandchildren. These are both invalid under the Rule against Perpetuities. It is possible that Oliver can die. After Oliver dies, another grandchild could be born to Connor or Carla. Connor and Carla can then die, along with Vivian, Robert, and Victor. The child would then turn 25 after a life in being at the time creation of the grant plus 21 years in this situation. The court can apply the Rule of Conveneince to Victor's interest. This will close the class. Vivian will still elgible to join the closed class if she reaches 25; however, any unborn grandchildren will not be elgible to join the class. "," 1A. The court can apply the Rule of Conveneince to Victor's interest. This will close the class. Vivian will still elgible to join the closed class if she reaches 25; however, any unborn grandchildren will not be elgible to join the class. 2) 1A. The first issue is whether Alex and Brock own the land as tenants in common or as joint tenants. Brock likely does not have a joint tenancy with Alex. In order to form a joint tenancy, the parties must have obtained the land at the same time, through the same document, have an equal share of interest in the property, and also have equal possession to use all of the land. In this case, Alex purchased the land prior to Brock and later signed him on in a mutual document. This likely satisfies the requirement that a joint tenancy be created in the same document, at the same time, equally splitting the interest and allowing all tenant to possess the whole of the land. Courts have traditionally been difficult in accepting the creation of a joint tenancy, often requiring the inclusion of a right of survivorship to create a joint tenancy, going as far as stating that words such as jointly may not be enough. In the case of ambiguity, courts have favored the creation of a tenants in common. If this case, the conveyance is ambiguous, as it mentions tenants in common while also having the term jointly included, furthermore, there is not mention of right of survivorship. As a result, Alex and Brock are likely tenants in common. If they were found to be joint tenants, Brock would first have to unilaterally sever his joint tenancy. This could be accomplished by conveying his interest in the property to another person, a straw man, or himself if the jurisdiction is following the modern doctrine. Being a tenant in common, Brock could convey his interest in the land to the developers, however, Alex would still maintain his share of the land and a right to use the whole of the land. Furthermore, Alex would not be compelled to contribute to any improvements made to the land by the developers. If Brock, or the developers, do not wish to do this, Brock could also order a partition. There are 2 types of partitions: partition in kind and partition by sale. Courts prefer to utilize partition in kind in theory, though in practice they often order partition by sale. This is because when land is divided by a partition in kind, the land is divided by value, not by the actual amount of land. Delfino v Valencias. In order to have a partition by sale, Brock must prove that it is impracticable to divide the land, that it is in the best interest to the parties, and that none of the parties will be unfairly prejudiced. In this case, Alex will likely say that he will be unfairly prejudiced as he has an emotional investment in the land. The interest of parties is not purely economical, courts may also consider the sentimental value of the property. Delfino. Brock may also be able to declare that he was ousted from the land, as Alex told him to ""get out of here, and don't come back."" To be ousted a This is because when land is divided by a partition in kind, the land is divided by value, not by the actual amount of land. Delfino v Valencias. In order to have a partition by sale, Brock must prove that it is impracticable to divide the land, that it is in the best interest to the parties, and that none of the parties will be unfairly prejudiced. In this case, Alex will likely say that he will be unfairly prejudiced as he has an emotional investment in the land. The interest of parties is not purely economical, courts may also consider the sentimental value of the property. Delfino. Brock may also be able to declare that he was ousted from the land, as Alex told him to ""get out of here, and don't come back."" To be ousted a person must be excluded from the property and informed they are no longer welcome back. If Brock was ousted, he can demand rent for the land, however, if Brock was ousted, he no longer has an interest in the land. 1B. Dear Carl, The bag of gold coins you have may fall ender several different categories. The coins may be construed as treasure trove. If the coins are found to be treasure trove, as the finder, you will have a superior claim to the coins against all but the rightful owner. This, however, poses some problems. As shown in Corliss v Wenner there are jurisdictions that do not recognize treasure trove, as they wish to discourage people from trespassing in an attempt to find and rightfully claim buried treasure. If the jurisdiction does not recognize treasure trove, they may find it to embedded, in which case, the owner of the property has a superior claim. As the coins were dated in the late 1800's and they were found in a grocery bag from a store that opened 10 years ago, a court may also determine them to be lost, mislaid, or abandoned. Of these 3 options, lost is the least likely, as it is unlikely a the bag would get tucked into a small hole serendipitously. If, however, the bag was found to be lost, as the finder you would have a superior claim to all but the righful owner. If the coins were found to be mislaid, the property owner would have a superior claim to all but the rightful owner. The logic in giving the property owner a superior claim, is that, in the case of mislaid property, the rightful owner will retrace their steps and return to the location where they mislaid their possessions. If the property is deemed to be abandoned, as the finder, you will have a superior claim to all, including the original owner as they had abandoned their property. In regards to your growler, the brewery may have been a bailee in the case of the growler. There were similar facts surrounding the case of Allen v Hyatt. In this case, you were given a claim ticket that corresponded with a tag of the same number attached yo your growler. This is similar to Allen being given a ticket for his car upon entering the garage.4Similarly, in order to take back your growler, you needed to show the bartender your claim ticket, just as Allen needed to use his card to exit the parking garage. This may create an implied bailment, as it is implied that the bar will keep your growler safe and have a superior claim to all, including the original owner as they had abandoned their property. In regards to your growler, the brewery may have been a bailee in the case of the growler. There were similar facts surrounding the case of Allen v Hyatt. In this case, you were given a claim ticket that corresponded with a tag of the same number attached yo your growler. This is similar to Allen being given a ticket for his car upon entering the garage. Similarly, in order to take back your growler, you needed to show the bartender your claim ticket, just as Allen needed to use his card to exit the parking garage. This may create an implied bailment, as it is implied that the bar will keep your growler safe and return it to you by requiring you to have a claim ticket that matched your growler. In the creation of a bailment, the bailee is responsible for your property and damages accrued come with a presumption of negligence against the bailee. As a result, if a bailment was found to be created, you may sue to recover for the damages incurred by loss of your growler. If the growler was given to another customer and not dropped as the bartender suspected, the brewery is likely liable for conversion of property. As established in Kremen v Cohen, conversion of property result when a person has actual possession of the item, there is a wrongful disposition of that item, and damages are accrued. It is likely that your coat is not subject to bailment as it was an public coat rack that had no implications of being kept safe. In the case where a man parked his car in an open lot and the car was subsequently stolen, it was found that no bailement was created. The coat rack is similar to the open lot as it is open to the public and there is no implication that any person is watching over and ensuring protection of the coats. The brewery may argue that no bailment was created. They may say that there are differences between Allen and your case. The brewery may point to the fact that in Allen there was only one exit that the car could have gone through. They may also point to the fact that there was an earlier warning of nefarious activities as the parking attendant was notified that someone was messing with the cars in the garage. In your case, there is a possibilty that someone could have simply swiped the growler off the bar while no one was looking. Furthermore, the court found that the ticket alone was not enough to create a bailment in Allen, similarly, a court may find that the claim ticket was not enough to create a bailment for your growler. 1C. David was granted a fee simple subject to executory limitation. Frank and Fred had an executory interest in the land as their interest could cut short David's interest. Edward has not yet violated his fee simple subject to executory limitation as he has not yet begun construction of the development. As a result, the executory interest will not vest. If however, David bailment for your growler. 1C. David was granted a fee simple subject to executory limitation. Frank and Fred had an executory interest in the land as their interest could cut short David's interest. Edward has not yet violated his fee simple subject to executory limitation as he has not yet begun construction of the development. As a result, the executory interest will not vest. If however, David moves forward with his plans and develops land not used for residential purposes, the land will be conveyed to Frank and Fred. The conveyance to Edward is ambiguous, as it uses language of duration (so long as) but also states that Alex has a right of entry. In the case of ambiguous grants, court have traditionally created a fee simple subject to condition subsequent rather than create a fee simple determinable. As a result, Edward was given a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and Alex retained a right of entry. When Edward began to make IPA's he violated the condition subsequent. Alex, having a right of entry, must bring his claim that Edward violated the condition forward to reclaim the land that he granted him. "," Betty Betty and Andrew owned multiple pieces of real estate as Tenants by the Entirety. In order to create a tenancy by the entirety, it must be created by the same document, at the same time, with all tenants having an equal interest and right to use the entire property. There is no issue with the creation of the Tenants by the Entirety. Tenants by the Entirety also retain a right of survivorship. Although Betty never visited Greenacre, she was still a rightful owner as she a tenant by the entirety. Unlike a joint tenancy, which may be severed unilaterally, Tenants by the Entirety must bilaterally sever their interest. US v Craft. In Kotis v Nowlin, voidable title was able to be passed if it was fraudently acquired and the purchaser made the purchase in good faith. Chris, not knowing that the document was forged, was able to purchase the title that was fraudently acquired, thus acquiring a voidable title to Greenacre. When Andrew died in 2004, Betty became sole possessor of Greenacre through her right of survivorship; however, Chris possessed a voidable title to the land. Betty would have to bring action forward to have the title voided. Debbie purchaser made the purchase in good faith. Chris, not knowing that the document was forged, was able to purchase the title that was fraudently acquired, thus acquiring a voidable title to Greenacre. When Andrew died in 2004, Betty became sole possessor of Greenacre through her right of survivorship; however, Chris possessed a voidable title to the land. Betty would have to bring action forward to have the title voided. Debbie Debbie, in order to have possession of Greenacre, would have to acquire it through adverse possession. The statute of limitation for Adverse possession is 10 years; furthermore, debbie must also have ahd actual possession, been open and notorious, been in continuous possession, been exclusive in her possession, and been hostile as to her possession. Pimental v. Medro. Debbie likely has far surpassed the 10 year statute of limitations required to adversely possess property. Debbie was left Greenacre by her father in 2009. The purchase was made in good faith, which may allow Debbie to assert privity. This will allow Debbie to tack on the years that Chris was in possession of the land, allowing her to claim that Adverse possession began in 2001. The mindset of adverse possessors is not usually considered, although some states require good faith, such as Oregon, as found in Tieu v. Morgan and some states require bad faith, such as Maine. Debbie has actual possession of the property as she is living on the property. Unlike Gorski, Debbies possession is blatant as she has an entire house on the land. This is in contrast to Gorski, where notification of actual possession was required because it was such a small encroachment on the land. Debbie is also open and notorious with her property as she has a home that others would be able to see, she has also cleared land and made a small garden. Unlike in Marengo cave, where it was found that the Marengo cave tour was not open and notorious as there was no way for Ross to know the cave was under his land, it is obvious that Debbie is occupying the land. Debbie has also continuosly lived on the land. Chris, although he only occupied the land 8 weeks a year, was also continuous as he had used the land as in way that may be traditionally used by owners. Betty may argue that the possession was not continuous, as Chris passed away in 2009 and Debbie did not start to occupy the land until 2011. However, Debbie built a year round house on the land and it is unclear if she was using the land in a similar manner to her father the year prior. If the court agrees that Debbie was not continuous, Debbie will not have satisfied all the elements needed for adverse possession. Debbie was also exclusive in her land, as was her father Chris. Although they allowed neighbors to utilize their land, they were still exclusive as the owners are allowed to allow others onto their property. The court also looks to how the land may be used in that area. Considering where Greenacre is located, it is not uncommon for people to utilize others land to hunt or fish. Furthermore, Debbie does not allow any neighbors onto the 2 acres around her house without her permission. Debbie on the land and it is unclear if she was using the land in a similar manner to her father the year prior. If the court agrees that Debbie was not continuous, Debbie will not have satisfied all the elements needed for adverse possession. Debbie was also exclusive in her land, as was her father Chris. Although they allowed neighbors to utilize their land, they were still exclusive as the owners are allowed to allow others onto their property. The court also looks to how the land may be used in that area. Considering where Greenacre is located, it is not uncommon for people to utilize others land to hunt or fish. Furthermore, Debbie does not allow any neighbors onto the 2 acres around her house without her permission. Debbie is also hostile as she believed she was the righful owner of the land. This is in contrast to Cahill v. Morrow, where a letter was sent offering to buy the lot, suggesting that Cahill did not believe she had the superior claim. Again, most states do not inquire into the mindstate of the adverse possessor; however some do. If in a jurisdiciton that require bad fath, Debbie will likely not satisfy this requirement as she genuinly believed herself the be the owner; in contrast, if good faith is required she does satisfy that element. If it is found that Debbie did not acquire the land through privity, Betty is likely still the owner of Greenacre through her right of survirorship as the statute of limitations has not passed since she began her adverse possession in 2011.

bdee7221-5574-4aa6-8021-e3009d938323," The first child of Oliver's to retire would have a contingent remainder in life estate. Robert would have a vested remainer in life estate. Oliver's grandchildren to reach the age of 25 would have a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple. The rules against perpetuities would apply to the first child's contingent remainder and the grandchildren's vested remainder subject to open in fee simple. The first child of Oliver's to retire's interest would fail RAP because Oliver could have a new child tomorrow, then Oliver and his other Children and Robert could pass away and by the time this new child retires it would be more than 21 years after a life in being, so this interest is void. The grandchildren's interest is also void under RAP because a new grandchild could be born and then everyone else in the family could pass away. This grandchild would turn 25 more than 21 years after a life in being at the time of the creation of the deed. With these two interests gone, the only interests would be Robert's vested remainder in life estate. This means that Oliver would then have a following reversion in fee simple absolute. "," A. Brock, your property interest in the warehouse site is a tenancy in common with you brother, Alex. This type of property interest gives you the right to use and enjoy the entire property in question and gives you the right to half (1/2) of any revenue that comes in from the brewery, restaurant, and any other profits that come from the use of the property. Your brother Alex is entitled to the other half of this revenue. If the property is sold, you would both each be entitled to one half of the amount of money the property sold for. Because you are tenants in common and not joint tenants, you can each devise your interest in the property to anyone you wish, either while alive or through a will and this will only effect the half of the interest that the one individual holds in the property. Whoever the other brother choses to convery their interest to, if they wish, will only be entitled to the same half of profits the brother was intially entitled to, and they would still being to enjoy the property in its entirety. Usually, a tenant in common cannot request rent be payed to him, unless there is the case of an ouster as we learned from the father and son case with the trailer lot. In this case, this would require one brother to banish the property sold for. Because you are tenants in common and not joint tenants, you can each devise your interest in the property to anyone you wish, either while alive or through a will and this will only effect the half of the interest that the one individual holds in the property.

Usually, a tenant in common cannot request rent be payed to him, unless there is the case of an ouster as we learned from the father and son case with the trailer lot. In this case, this would require one brother to banish the other from the property and take actual steps to not allow them to come back onto the property. Although Alex did yell at you, Brock and tell you to get out and not come back, this may not be anough to constitute an ouster because you did voluntarily leave and there was only this one instance may not have been a real attempt on Alex to ban you forever. The argument could be made however, that this would constitute an ouster for the purposes of rent payments. In this case, however, you are interested in making money from the developer and not your brother, so this would not matter much. Because your brother does not want to sell to the developer, your options would be to go to court and have them partition the property so that it would separate you and your brother's interests. The two options are generally either partition in kind, or partition in sale. Partition in kind is when a court will divide the property according to the share of interest each tenant has, in this case the court would split the property into two halves. Each brother would gain one parcel of the land that the court would try and figure out how to divide based on the usage of each party. If for some reason there is not a fair way to devide the property, the party that got the more benefit from the partition, perhaps their land is more desirable for some reason, may have to pay an owelty to the other party in order to compensate for any injustice in the partition as we saw with the lot of land with a trash business on one side. The other option would be a partition by sale where the court will order the property to be sold and the proceeds will be split according to the property interest, for you, Brock, each brother will get 50% of the sale. The court will consider different factors in deciding which type of partition to chose, fairness, if that specific property is necessary for the use, etc. Usually, though, the courts prefer a partition in kind because it is usually more fair and easier for the court to divide. B. Carl, in regards to the gold coins that you found, this would be a treasure trove type of found property. Generally, this refers to something of value that was found in some area that would seem to show someone had purposefully hidden it in that area for them to come back and find. In these cases, the individual with the best claim to the 'treasure' is the person who actually hid the property themselves, and then the next best claim would be for the person who found the items, who, in this case would be B. Carl, in regards to the gold coins that you found, this would be a treasure trove type of found property. Generally, this refers to something of value that was found in some area that would seem to show someone had purposefully hidden it in that area for them to come back and find. In these cases, the individual with the best claim to the 'treasure' is the person who actually hid the property themselves, and then the next best claim would be for the person who found the items, who, in this case would be you. You would have the best claim for this property that would extend to everyone in the world except the true owner themselves, and you would have to give the treasure over to them if they came forward. Some jurisdictions however, as we saw in the case where coins were found in the backyard by the worker, do not recognize this type of right. They want to discourage trespassers from attempting to find treasure in other people's property, and they may give the treasure over to the owner of the property in which it was found, which would be the owners of the brewery. We will have to do some research to find out if New Suffolk recognizes this right or not. As to your growler, which you gave to the bartender for which you received a ticket and a tag was put on it, you could have some relief for negligence against the brewery. Because you received a ticket for the growler when you handed it over and there was a person there who you expected to be keeping it safe in a secure location, this may constitute a bailment relationship. This would mean that the brewery had a duty to you to take care of your growler and keep it safe and if it was broken or something was wrong with it there negligence would be understood on the part of the brewery like a car stolen from a parking garage that gave it ticket and had an attendant as we saw in that case. There could be a counterargument if the ticket you received had a disclaimer about the brewery not being responsible for anything happening to your item and in that case negligence would have to be proven. Carl, you also lost your coat in the brewery and in this case you have the best claim to your coat. This would be a mislain item because you know where you placed it but it was not there when you came back. You probably could not be awarded damages from the brewery becasuse there was no understanding that your coat would always be taken care of by them, but if someone were to find it, they would not have a good claim to your coat. Because this was a mislain item and not lost, the owner of the establishment where it was found, in this case the owner of the brewery would have a better claim for your coat because you are more likely to go back and try and find it and ask them for it like in the barbershop case. Because you are the true owner and have the best claim to your coat, the owner would have to give it over to you. C. Alex, as you wrote the deed to David for the vacant part of your property, David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation and Frank and Fred would have an executory interest in fee simple as the brewery would have a better claim for your coat because you are more likely to go back and try and find it and ask them for it like in the barbershop case. Because you are the true owner and have the best claim to your coat, the owner would have to give it over to you. C. Alex, as you wrote the deed to David for the vacant part of your property, David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation and Frank and Fred would have an executory interest in fee simple as tenants in common. Because of a legal principal, called the Rules Against Perpetuities, however, the future interests of your sons in that property is void. This is because the condition that the property only ever be used for residential uses, could be failed at any time from now to a more than a hundred years from now which could definitely be more than 21 years after a life in being at the time of the creation of the deed which the rule requires. This means that the future interest you attempted to give to your sons is invalid. If that interest is removed, this would mean that David actually has a fee simple determinable which would grant you the future interest in the posibility of reverter. Because Alex is actually going to use the land for purposes other than residential, when he does it, your posibility of reverter would mean the title of the property automatically transfers to you and you will regain a fee simple absolute in the property. The language used to create the deed to Edward does sound like it could refer to him having a fee simple determinable, but the explicit language more closely aligns with a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because you, Alex, have a future interest in the right to re- entry. This type of future interest is not automatic like the possibility of reverter, so in this case you could have to formally take back the title to this part of the property to reaquire your title in fee simple absolute legally to get your property back as Edward clearly violated the condition set out in the deed. "," Betty and Andrew owned their property as tenants by the entirety which meant that they both had a right to the entirety of their property and that this ownership could not be dissolved if not by mutual agreement, divorce, or death. While Andrew forged Betty's signature when he sold it to Chris, this is not recognized as a way to dissovle this type of ownership and when Andrew died, the property should have belonged to Betty as tenancy by the entirety has a right of survivorship. Debbie does have a superior claim to Greenacre (as long as the statute of limitations has passed) because of the doctrine of color of title. When Debbi's father, Chris, bought the property, he believed that he was the true owner of the entire 50 acre property. It had been used from 2001 to 2019 as a usual owner would, and Betty 6 never came up to the property to see it for herself5toofnotice the property's use was continuous, actual, notorious and open and exclusive. The doctrine of color of title allows the individual who has received a faulty title to have claim to the entire property that they believe they own, in this case the entire 50 acres, have belonged to Betty as tenancy by the entirety has a right of survivorship.

It had been used from 2001 to 2019 as a usual owner would, and Betty never came up to the property to see it for herself to notice the property's use was continuous, actual, notorious and open and exclusive. The doctrine of color of title allows the individual who has received a faulty title to have claim to the entire property that they believe they own, in this case the entire 50 acres, not only the amount that they use as is customary under general adverse posession law; so not only the 2 acres that Betty lives on. The use was continuous because Chris and then Debbie used it either during the fishing season as is probably customary and then to live on full time. Actual because they were present on the property, their presence was open, and although they allowed others on the land, the use was exclusive because they controlled who they allowed to come onto it. The argument could only be made for the continuous element because a court could decide Chris's use was not customary for a typical owner of the area and the statute of limitations would have to be evaluated (it was not given to me in this fact pattern). The time that Chris used it could be tacked onto Debbie's time for purposes of the statute of limitaions as we saw in the Pimental case because the property was voluntarily conveyed from father to daughter.

According to the language ""jointly as tenants in common"" both brother's have a tenancy in common (TIC). Normally TIC are granted with ambiguious language however the language is rather clear to explain the nature of the property intrest. The deed does not mention a right of survivorship in suggecstion of a JT. A TIC ownes a sepreate fractional yet univided whole in the entire propety. Both brothers have a partial right to 3rd party profts, carrying chargets, etc. and an entire intrest in property rights such as posession, use, the right to exluce, etc. When one tentant dies his intrest is greanted to his heris/ conveyence. The issue is whether Brock should bring an action of partition in kind (PIK) or partition in sale (PIS). Since Alex refuses to sell the land, Brock's best option would to bring a partition action against Alex. A PIK is when the court sepreates the land into parcels worth a fair value. PIK in favored by the court but very difficult to determine how to sepreate parcels into a fair vlaue. PIS is when the court forces the land to be sold at market value. Although this is not the preffered method of the court this is the most popular option. Court's opten only grant PIS when 1) a PIK is not feasable and 2) when both parties' interest are better off. In this case Brock would most likely get batter value though a partion in sale since the developer is offering $2 mill between the two brothers. It is the burden therefore of brock to prove that a PIS is the best option. Brock may argue that 1) a PIK is not feasable becaue it would be imparactical to split up the 10 acres and warehosue with equal value. On the other hand Alex may argure that this extmely feasable because it would be fair for Alex to keep the warehouse. Brock would also argue that 2) the PIS would better intrest the brother because they are reciving great compensation. However, like in Delfino where the trash collectors business would be harmed with a PIS and thus was granted a PIK, selling the land at PIS would hurt Alex's booming business and force him to move elsewhere. In concludion, since courts often weight in favor of a PIK it is likely that Alex's argument as PIK will prevail reguardless of Brock's financial benefits with a PIS. (B) This issue here is is Carl could claim posesson of the Coins through aspects of finders law. Finders law has 4 aspects absonded, lost, mislaid, and treasure trove as property.

While it may be hard to claim the coins were abandoned since a reasonable person would not intentionlly give up $20,000 and also hard to claim lost since they were cleary placed in a mesh bag inside a hole, it is plausable Carl could argue the coins were mislaid or treasure trove. An abandoned item is one that an ownder intentonally relinquishes ownership. In order to have the best claim to the coins Carl must argue that they were a treaure trove. A treasure trove is when one intentilly places/ burries coins and forgets were they are left and the finder has claim if the true owner does not come back. Carl may argue that the coins were clearly intentionlly placed due to the wrap and hidden nature and the true owner will not come back for them because they were dated at 1800s. In Corliss, the wrapped nature of burried coins suggested that they were a treausre trove, however the court rule that they were mislaid. The Court noramlly likes to refair from using treasure trove to prevent thef and prevent speculation of the true ownders intent. The warehouse will likely argue that the item was mislaid. A mislaid item is intentially placed and forgoten and the owner of the proepty it is forgotten on gets claim if the true owner does not come back. It can be argued that the coins were intenitlly placed and the true owner intented on coming back. As in Benejmin, the true ownder intentionally misplaced $18,000 in a bag in the wing of a plane. The plane owner had claim to the money since it was dated in the 50s and 60s. Like in Benjamin, the coins were placed in a bag and the owner is likely dead and not coming back for the coins. In conclusion, the warehouse owneer will likely prevail because the argument of mislaid is favored over treasure trove. This issue is whether there was a baliment relationship between Carl and the Bar in regaurd to the growler. If there was a baliment relationship Carl was the bailor who entrusted the Bar with his Crawler. In Allen the closed nature, security, and ticketing of the garuage suggested there was bailemy betwwen the bailor who dropped of their car and the garge owner (baillee). Simialr, the closed nature of the bar suggests that the bartnerder was the bailee. No one but employees were allowed to use the growler and since an employee likely broke the growler it is the repsonsbility. However, it may be argued that there were not secuity measures for the growler in contrast to Allen. In concludion Carl has a good argument to bring a claim agains the bar to reimbure him for the growelr. This issue is whether there was a baliment relationship between Carl and the Bar in regaurd to the coat. In contrast to the nature of the bar, the coat rack was much more open. There were no precuations being taken to protect the coat nor was the coat securied. Unlike in Allen, the reosabilbily was not left up to the bar to keep the coat safe making them not the bailor of the coat. It is likely there was not a bailment relationship beyween the bar and Carl in regaurds to the coat. to bring a claim agains the bar to reimbure him for the growelr.

It is likely there was not a bailment relationship beyween the bar and Carl in regaurds to the coat. (c) The issue is whether Frank and Fred have the right to take back the vacant 5 acres that was given to David. Accoridng to the conveyence David's intrest is FS determible and Frank and Fred has the possibility of a reverter in FS. We know this acording to the language ""so long as"". If David uses the land for anything other than residential purpuses, which he did though commercial stores, Frank and Fred have the right to take back the acres without acting. It looks like Frank and Fred have a good claim, however, the last clause violate RAP, making the claim no longer valuble. David could use the land for residential purposes 100 yrs past a LIB + 21. In conclusion, David would likely previal. The issue is whether 1) Elixar has a FS determinabe or a FS subject to condition subsequent and 2) if Alex have the right to take back the warehouse from Elixar. Accoridng to the language it is very ambiguous. The language states ""so long as"" suggesting determiable and ""reetnty"" suggesting sub to condtion subsequent. When the language is ambiguous courts favor sub to condition sub over dertermiable because some action must be taken to take back he land when Elixar uses it to make IPAs. Since the langaue is ambiguous is is likely that the court will rule in favor of sub to condtion sub in FS thus giving Alex the right of entry as long as he takes action. In contrast, Melhorze did not rule in favor of sub to conditon sub but intead determible. This was due to the fact the the converyence was not ambiguous but clearly a determiable intrest. Next, since Elixar used the land to make IPA's it is likely that if Alex acts he will have a good cliam againt Elixar. Elixar's inretest is not subject to RAP thus he cannot use that as a defense. In short, Alex has the best claim against Elixar so long as he physically acts to take back the land. 3) The issue here is whether Debbie obtained the property through proper conveyence. Andrew and Bettey were tenant bu the entirety (TBE )and thus equally owned the whole of the property. Like JT, TBE requires the 4 unties of time, titile, interest and posession but also requires marrige. Also like JT, as TBE acts to take back the land. "," The issue here is whether Debbie obtained the property through proper conveyence. Andrew and Bettey were tenant bu the entirety (TBE )and thus equally owned the whole of the property. Like JT, TBE requires the 4 unties of time, titile, interest and posession but also requires marrige. Also like JT, as TBE when one tenant dies the other has the right of survivorship, or the right to take the intrest of the dead owner. A TBE cannot be servered through anything but death of one tenant, agreement, or divorce. Like in Harms where the lien theory of a mortage did not sever JT, when Andrew conveyed the peices of real estae to Chris, the conveyence did not sever the TBE and thus was invalid. Since Chris's intrest is invalid his conveyence to his daughter is also invalid. Thus, In conclusion, Debbie does not own the land through proper conveyece. The issue here is whether Chris aquired the land that he lived on through AP. In order to aquire the land through AP he must satisfy the 10 yrs SOL, must be actual (actually living there), open and nutorious (puts the true owner on notice that they possess). exlusion (act as own and does not allow anyone else on without permission), continuous, (not intrupted depending on time and place), and hostile (action without permission). In the minority of jursidiction hostile posession is either required to be in good faith or bad faith. the majority of the states however just require simply not having permissin. It can be argued that Chris owned the land actually by using it for it's intended prupose (huting and living), open and nutorious by making it known he was living there (if Betty did go to the land she would have known), contunoius by using it for the time during it's normal season (8 weeks a year), exlusively by giving permission to other people to fish and hunt but treating it as his own and hostile because he clearly did not have legal permission. However, Chris did not satisfy the SOL because he only lived on the land for 8 years. Thus Chris does not own the land through AP. The issue here is whether Debbie aquired the land that she lived on through AP. While it seems like Debbie did aquire the land through AP by tacking on her father's AP use, Debbie is not allowed to tack on his AP years. Since Chris does not own legal title through conveyence by Andrew the transfer of Chri's will to Debbie was not a privity. A prvitity is a legal recognized trasfer. While one would say Debbie, like Chris, acted actually by living there, open and notorious, contintuous (even more permientent than Chris), exlusice, and hostile Debbie does not satisfy the claim of AP if she does not tack on Chris's AP years. From 2011 to 2019 does not7 satsify the 10 year SOL. If the SOL was satisfied and Debbie did aqure AP she would possibly have a claim to the entire land through color of title due to her fraudulent document. Color of title would require Debbie to AP a portion of the entire land. Since she in good faith thought the rest of the land was her's and the true owner (Betty) did not ever enter the land she could have had claim to the entire land. In conlsuon, since the SOL was not satisfied and Debbie could not tack on her father's AP years, she did not aquire the land though AP nor the rest of the land through color of titile and Bettey has a good claim to oust Debbie.

72162df3-a93a-447b-9155-24b29b7c4a05," Prior to the conveyance we say O holds his property in fee simple. This is significant because in the US someone always has a present possessory interest inm real property. This means that at the end of the conveyances, if the property is not conveyed as fee-simple or the conveyance violates the rule against perpetuties, O will hold a reversion. Before addressing that, however, we consider the language of O's grant. The first conveyance, ""to the first of my children to retire, for life"" creates a life estate, which is subject to a condition precident--that being the child must actually retire. As we don't know whether conor or carla will retire first, we cannot say that either has a future interest in the property that has already vested. The next conveyance is to a living ascertainable person as well, in this case Robert, O's nephew. Robert holds a remainder in a life estate, however note that the conveyance to robert does not include any conditions. As such, we say that robert holds an indefeasably vested remainder, as there is no future event that could divest his interest, nor is he part of a class that will enlarge and thus dilute his share of ownership. The final aspect of the grant ""then to [o's] grandchildren who reach the age of 25"", creates a contingent remainder (we don't know if/how many additional grandchildren will live to reach 25. Next we consider the R.A.P and whether it applies to any aspect of the grant. RAP concerns three types of conveyance generally: executory interest subject to a condition, a vested remainder subject to open, and a contingent remainder. In this case, Oliver has two grandchildren at the time of the grant, but the future interest created in each varies. Victor, who is 26, has already had his interest in the property vest by virtue of meeting the ""age 25"" condition. But because other grandschildren--vivian and others yet unborn--could reach age 25 and see their interests vest, we say Victor has a future interest--in fee simple because the ""for life"" language has dropped off--which is a vested remainder subject to open. Vivian, who is 17, has not yet vested at the time of the conveyance, so her interst is in fee simple, but is a contingent remainder. RAP allows the grantor to convey property for one life plus 21 years, so in this the future interest created in each varies. Victor, who is 26, has already had his interest in the property vest by virtue of meeting the ""age 25"" condition. But because other grandschildren--vivian and others yet unborn--could reach age 25 and see their interests vest, we say Victor has a future interest--in fee simple because the ""for life"" language has dropped off--which is a vested remainder subject to open. Vivian, who is 17, has not yet vested at the time of the conveyance, so her interst is in fee simple, but is a contingent remainder. RAP allows the grantor to convey property for one life plus 21 years, so in this case, because victor and vivian are alive and in being at the time of the grant, we test to see whether their interest will vest or forever fail to vest within the perpetuity window (which begins at the time the grant took legal effect--presumably when it is read). Victor's interest has already vested, and vivian's will either vest or forever fail to vest within the 21 year period as she is already 17 (so she either dies before 25 or after w/in the next four years). The future interest held by as-of-yet unborn future grandchildren however would violate the rule against perpetuities, and so at common law this purported interest would be void. Further complicating this is the old common law provision that ""bad for one means bad for all"" with classes subject to enlargement. That means that at common law this entire provision would be invalid. The rule of convience however allows any member of the class who could take possession at the termination of the prior estate to do so--and thus closes the class and protects the conveyance. In this case, because victor is 26, the rule of convience allows the class to close and for the grandchidren's interest in the property maintained exclusively by victor and vivian. "," A) Regarding Brock's property interest, we musty first decipher the language of the initial conveyance ""jointly as tenants in common"" as joint tenants and tenants in common are different and carry significantly different property interests. In this case, even if alex intended to create a joint tenancy (which would include survivorship benifits), it would be treated as a tenancy in common because the conveyance lacks the unity of time required for the creation of a joint tenancy. The four unities are time (possession granted at same time which fails here), title (same document/instrament), interest, (ownership must be divided evenly), and possession which means they must possess it at the same time of the property is as a Tenant in common, he (which is true for either JT or TIC. Given that B's3 share can only sell/transfer his portion of the land. He cannot unilaterally take possession from or exclude alex. Likewise, even though Alex yells at brock to ""leave and never come back"", he cannot exclude (which would include survivorship benifits), it would be treated as a tenancy in common because the conveyance lacks the unity of time required for the creation of a joint tenancy. The four unities are time (possession granted at same time which fails here), title (same document/instrament), interest, (ownership must be divided evenly), and possession which means they must possess it at the same time (which is true for either JT or TIC. Given that B's share of the property is as a Tenant in common, he can only sell/transfer his portion of the land. He cannot unilaterally take possession from or exclude alex. Likewise, even though Alex yells at brock to ""leave and never come back"", he cannot exclude brock from the property as they own it together as tenants in common. This is significant because as tenants in common, both A&B are entitled to 50% of the revenue from the property as long as that ownership structure remains intact. As TIC, both A and B have the right to occupy and use the entire 10 acre property and have superior claim against the rest of the world but not each other. Brock's best option will be to pursue a court order granting a partition by sale, which would then allow him to maximize the money from the developer. Traditionally, courts would favor a partition in kind, meaning that the land will be divided equally according to ownership. Under a partition in kind, the court would sub-divide the ten acres and then allow brock to sell his portion. This proves difficult in practice however, as courts are sensitive to circumstances where the land cannot be practically or easily divided fairly. moreover, there are valid policy considerations that suggest everyone would profit more if the court allows a partition by sale. In that scenario, the court can order the sale of the entire disputed property and then order the proceeds distributed evenly to the tenants. Courts typically don't like forcing the sale of land out from under an unwilling party, so Brock's strongest argument will be that (1) a partition in kind is not possible/practical and (2) the market price received will be a better arbitor/determinor of value than the courts judgement. Alex will argue he has invested significant emotional, physical, and monetary capital into that particular location and that it would be unfair for the court to force him to sell as that amount would prove to difficult to account for in terms of compensation. Additionally, the cost of moving the business, including the opportunity-cost of the downtime until the new location is fully up-and running, could be difficult for the court to account for and impose a significant burden on Alex. Case law favors Alex's position even though, ironically, he may end up being worse off finiancially in the long run. Ultimately the law tries to balance the societal benefit of these transactions and the freedom of alienability doctrine with the notion that we can't force a person to sell their property without fair compensation. B) position even though, ironically, he may end up being worse off finiancially in the long run. Ultimately the law tries to balance the societal benefit of these transactions and the freedom of alienability doctrine with the notion that we can't force a person to sell their property without fair compensation. B) Carl's case involves multiple doctrines within property law including: finders/treasure trove doctrine, bailments, and lost or abandoned items. We address each in kind, beginning wth the first issue--who has the best claim to the gold coins. Under Hannah, the owner of the property has the best claim to items found on the property, so long as the owner is operating in (at least) constructive possession. Moreover, under Elwis, the owner need not even be aware that the found items exist to have valid claim to the title, so long as the constructive possession element over the land is satisfied. Based on those first two cases, Carl will have some challenges in maintaining his claim to the coins as against alex and brock. Still, the doctrine established by Sharman gives him an opening. Under Sharman, if the finder of the treasure (coins in this case) was on the land with permission and not acting as the agent of an employer. Carl entered the brewery as a customer in a place held open to the public--for the pecuniary benifit of the owner. Morever, because carl had to take some additional steps to dig for the coins (ie they were arguably not easily found), his claim is strengthened if he can show that alex and brock would not haver found the coins. Elwis does present a challenge for carl, however, if the grocery store chain is still in business and those coins in fact belong to the store. This doctrine would give the finder good title against anyone except the original owner. So if the coins truly belonged to the grocery store then they would have a superior claim. Carl's best legal action would be to seek a declaratory judgement from the court granting him sole ownership of the coins. Alex and brock will of course take the contratry postion, and argue under Hannah that they own the land and everything it contains--including the gold coins. Likewise, they can say that carl did not have to bring in excavating equipment or dig for months to find the coins, but rather found them as a result of pure chance--a chance that could have befallen any of ther customers. As such, Alex and Brock could make a complelling case for a declaratory judgement of thier own. The value of the coins is not insignificant, and so even if alex and brock are found to have the best title, there is some precident for a gratuity to be paid to carl for finding the coins. The next issue to consider is that of bailments, and whether a bailment was created when carl left the growler on the bar. The law around bailments turns on expectations created in the purported bailor by the supposed bailee. Case law dictates that a bailment is created when the owner of personal property judgement of thier own. The value of the coins is not insignificant, and so even if alex and brock are found to have the best title, there is some precident for a gratuity to be paid to carl for finding the coins. The next issue to consider is that of bailments, and whether a bailment was created when carl left the growler on the bar. The law around bailments turns on expectations created in the purported bailor by the supposed bailee. Case law dictates that a bailment is created when the owner of personal property entrusts that property to another on the condition and with the expectation that the property will be returned. As such the bailee has certain rights to the property (move it, repair it, use it, etc.) but they cannot sell or destroy the property. Also impacting the determination of a bailment relationship is the written contractual language on the bailment slip or other document created at the time of the bailment. The more specific the terms of the bailment on the reciept (valet parking pass or in this case ""valet"" growler fill-up service), the more likely a court will find that a bailment existed. Likewise, in a case where the purported bailee does not manifest any, or manifests very few objective indicia of control, a bailment may not be created. In the instant case, carl can argue a bailment was created when he dropped his growler off and recieved a claim ticket with a matching number for pickup later. the expectation in carl's mind was that the growler be returned, at it seems clear that his only purpose in surrendering the growler at all was to have it filled. This fact, coupled with the the fact that the growler was destroyed (at least presumably), might entitle carl to damages. bailment relationships sometimes expressly limit the the bailee's liability, but there is nothing in this case to suggest that was present here. The counterargement here would be that no bailment existed because the restaurant never gave carl any reasonable basis to believe a bailment was created. This argument is premised on the belief (perhaps a stretch) that the ticket contained no information other than a number which corresponded to a tag on the growler. Also, alex and brock's business would likely have some liability-limiting language that they could point to suggesting that these types of services do not constitute bailments, but rather are simply part of the service the business uniformly provides. While the brewery's argument is certainly weaker, Carl as the plaintiff in an action for damages would still bear the burden of showing a bailment was created. As it relates to his coat, carl's property is lost, but not abandoned. He did not leave the coat intending to discard it, but rather misplaced or mislaid the coat in a public place. Unlike the growler, where carl received a claim check and bailment relationship likely existed thereby entitling him to damages, no bailment exists relative to the coat. Carl simply left his coat on the hook and couldnt find it when he returned. If an employee finds the coat they will not be entitled to possession, but rather must turn the coat over to the brewery. Under the old common6law, the finder of lost property was required to hold it in trust, thereby preserving the claim of the original owner. This is no longer ther prevailing rule however, so should a non-employee find the coat, that person may have a vaid claim by virtue of their discard it, but rather misplaced or mislaid the coat in a public place. Unlike the growler, where carl received a claim check and bailment relationship likely existed thereby entitling him to damages, no bailment exists relative to the coat. Carl simply left his coat on the hook and couldnt find it when he returned. If an employee finds the coat they will not be entitled to possession, but rather must turn the coat over to the brewery. Under the old common law, the finder of lost property was required to hold it in trust, thereby preserving the claim of the original owner. This is no longer ther prevailing rule however, so should a non-employee find the coat, that person may have a vaid claim by virtue of their then-present possession of the coat. This determination would be fact-specifc and it would be important to understand the circiumstances about how the coat was found. Given that Carl comes in before the coat is found, however, it is unlikely we could recover any damages from the brewery as no bailment likely existed. Again, the burden would be on carl as the plaintiff, but if he cannot point to a coat check system or other reason why he reasonably believed a bailment was created then it is no different from carl leaving his coat on the subway. C) The first set of interests created occurs when alex decides to divide the property. Recall that Brock sold his interest to alex, so at the time alex goes to subdivide the 10 acre plot, he holds the entire estate in fee simple. In his conveyace to David alex uses the classic durational language associated with a fee simple determinable--""so long as"". After this, he creates a contingent remainder in fee simple to his sons frank and fred. A fee simple determinable automatically terminates when the durational term--including the ""as long as"" is met, and therefore Alex would need to take no further action. If the property conveyed to D is not used for residential uses, then frank and fred's remainder will automatically vest and they will be entitled to present possesion. Alex's deed does not say ""to frank as fred as joint tenants with right of survivorship"", so the law will treat their co-ownership as a tenancy in common--entitling each to 50% of the estate (and any profits derived there-from). Frank and Fred's remainder is in fee simple, so there would be no reversion to alex for those 5 acres. The language of the conveyance of the rest of the land presents a more challenging interpretation as the durational language ""so long as"" is used again. As stated above, this would typically connotate a fee simple defeasable determinable. The conveyance goes on to add a condition subsequent however, when it says ""if IPA's are ever made on the premises alex has the right to re-enter and reclaim"". The right of re-entry follows a fee-simple defeasable subject to a condition subsequent (in this case the manufacture of IPAs). The key distinction here is that where the fee simple determinale results in a possibility of reverter (back to the original owner) which happens automatically once the time period expires, a right of entry requires the owner to initiate legal action to reclaim the property. durational language ""so long as"" is used again. As stated above, this would typically connotate a fee simple defeasable determinable.

The key distinction here is that where the fee simple determinale results in a possibility of reverter (back to the original owner) which happens automatically once the time period expires, a right of entry requires the owner to initiate legal action to reclaim the property. Based on the facts in early 2017, the five acres belonging to david would immediately pass to F&F, so they would have a colorable claim for tresspass if david does not vacate the premises. As mentioned above, Alex could bring an action to quiet title or a motion for an ejection once IPA's are produced, because the court will likely treat that conveyance as a fee simple defeasible subject to a condition subsequent. 3) "," From the outset we should specify that a tenancy by the entirety functions the same way as a joint tenancy except that is only available to married couples, and cannot be terminated unilaterally by one party. This is significant here because while the relationship betweeen A&B was acrimonious at times, they never divorced and therefore the tenancy by entirety would void the transfer of title to Chris if Becky can show that her signiature was forged and she did not consent. Still, chris purchased this property under color of title, and because the facts suggest betty has no knowlege any of this happened, it will set up a scenario where Chris may have a valid adverse possession claim. Adverse possession requires five elements. The possession must be (1) open and notorious, (2) continious, (3) exclusive, (4) actual and (5) non-permissive or hostile. When Chris takes over the property in 2001, the AP clock starts running (at least chris and later debbie will argue) as he meets all of the criteria. Chris' enlarging and insulating of the cabin occured in plain sight for anyone to see, and that, coupled with his presence on the property to contemplate, take long walks, fish, etc. satisfies the Open and notorious prong. Juxtaposed from the 15-inch encroaching staircase in Manillo, modifications and improvements of this level suffice, obviating any need for actual notice to Betty. Chris also will argue his possession is continious because--in keeping with Howard v Kunto he needn't be on the property 24/7; he just needs to use 10in accordance with the accepted/expected it practices for that type of property. As this is primarily a hunting/fishing cabin, chris will argue his 8 weeks/year use (consistently during fishing fishing season) satisfies the second prong. Exclusivity, the that, coupled with his presence on the property to contemplate, take long walks, fish, etc. satisfies the Open and notorious prong. Juxtaposed from the 15-inch encroaching staircase in Manillo, modifications and improvements of this level suffice, obviating any need for actual notice to Betty. Chris also will argue his possession is continious because--in keeping with Howard v Kunto he needn't be on the property 24/7; he just needs to use it in accordance with the accepted/expected practices for that type of property. As this is primarily a hunting/fishing cabin, chris will argue his 8 weeks/year use (consistently during fishing fishing season) satisfies the second prong. Exclusivity, the third prong, presents Betty's best argument against adverse possession. Chris will argue it is satisfied because while he, and eventually his daughter, used the land exclusively besides any guests, the land was always held open to the public to pass through and hunt on. As it relates to the entire 50 acre parcel, Betty has a solid argument. Even after debbie takes control of the land she makes no claim that she is exclusively using the entire 50 acres, instead marking a two-acre boundry of her property which she does use exclusively. This distinction likely limits debbies AP claim to the two acres where the cabin is located. Actual possession is satisfied with regard to the two acre settled area, and again debated as it relates to the 48 remaining wild acres. The final element--non permissive/hostile possession is satisfied even though betty had no knowledge that anyone was on the property. The signigicant point here is that chris and debbie -- operating under color of title -- never had legal permission to use/occupy the land. When Betty arrives in 2019, she could bring a motion for ejectment, but debbie can counter-claim that she now owns the land (at least the 2 settled acres) via adverse possession. The statuory period here is satisfied because ""tacking"" is allowed between chris and debbie. as long as there was a voluntary transfer of the land, mutually agreed upon and in privity, the subsequent adverse possessor can ""tack"" on the prior adverse possessor's years of tolling if the ownership change is immediate. New Suffolk's SoL requires an action be brought within ten years after the cause of action accrues, and so without tacking, debbie's claim would fail (2011-2019 is only 8 years). Because tacking allows her to ""count"" her father's time (becasue all of the AP elements were met during that time and continued through debbies use/occupancy), the time began in 2001 and therefore the SoL is satisfied. The final thing to consider would be counter arguments betty could bring, specifically her focus on the time between 2009, when chris died, and 2011 when debbie moved there full-time. the continious element applies not only to intermittent absenses by chris or debbie, but also to the time (if any) between their use. If Betty can show that the land was not continiously possessed during that two-year gap, she could prevail on a claim for ejection. The case law established by Gorski proves particularly relevant in this regard, and this would ultimately be a fact-specifc determination. The court would look The final thing to consider would be counter arguments betty could bring, specifically her focus on the time between 2009, when chris died, and 2011 when debbie moved there full-time. the continious element applies not only to intermittent absenses by chris or debbie, but also to the time (if any) between their use. If Betty can show that the land was not continiously possessed during that two-year gap, she could prevail on a claim for ejection. The case law established by Gorski proves particularly relevant in this regard, and this would ultimately be a fact-specifc determination. The court would look to what activities, if any, debbie conducted during that time. While only some jurisdictions require the adverse possessor to pay property taxes during the tolling period, if debbie did pay the taxes (even if not required), that would certainly weigh in her favor. If the court rules that debbie does not have a valid AP claim, she still may be entitled to recover some compensation for the improvements she made to the land (formal garden, clearing land, etc). While a malicious trespasser cannot profit through adhesion, an innocent trespasser like debbie in this case might be able to recoup the fair market value of the improvements. ",718,2521,1029
8b2e671a-8164-4467-9f19-a6dc7cbf313c," The first interest created in Oliver's grant is ""to the first of my children to retire, for life"", which indicates a contingent remainder in life estate to the first of Oliver's children to retire. Although his children, Connor and Carla are named, which makes them ascertained people, they still have to satisfy a condition within the grant which is to be the first to retire. Typically for life does not come after a comma, but in this instance i'm still assuming that it is to the first of his children to retire for their lives. The second interest created is ""then to my nephew Robert for life"", since there is no condition indicated here, then the interest will shift to Robert when or if it is not satisfied by Oliver's children to retire, therefore Robert has a shifting executory interest in life estate. This would not be a vested remainder for Robert since it is not open to a class, it is just to open, and it is not a vested remainder in complete divestment because there is no subsequent condition that could take it from him, therefore it is an executory interest. The last interest is to Oliver's ""grandchildren who reach the age of 25"", two of whom are named Victor, who is 26 and Vivian, who is 17. Victor has satisfied the age condition and therefore is vested, creating a vested remainder subject to open, since the rest of Oliver's grandchildren could join this class. Vivian has a contingent remainder, since she still has to satisfy the age condition. In terms of the Rule of Perpetuities, the first interest to the first of Oliver's grandchildren to retire would be valid, since they are alive at the time of the grand and are their own lives in being, therefore they will know during their lifetime whether or not their interest will vest and if one of them will be the first to retire. The interest to his nephew Robert will also render void under RAP since we will not know during Oliver's life if Robert will get the interest or not, his children could outlive Robert and he would never get the interest. The last interest, to the grandchildren to reach the age of 25, will render void under RAP since we are unsure if Oliver will have additional grandchildren who may satisfy this condition within 21 years. If one of his children had a child tomorrow, and Oliver died soon after, then we will not know if that child will reach the age of 25 within 21 years. Although, if the rule of convenience was applied, which allows a class to close, under vested remainder subject to open, when one being satisfies the condition, then that interest will render valid. Since 10 satisfied the age of 25 requirement, then his Victor interest has vested and the class may close, rendering that interest to be valid under the RAP time period. Therefore the class is no longer open or has an indefinite time period, Vivian's age no longer since we are unsure if Oliver will have additional grandchildren who may satisfy this condition within 21 years. If one of his children had a child tomorrow, and Oliver died soon after, then we will not know if that child will reach the age of 25 within 21 years. Although, if the rule of convenience was applied, which allows a class to close, under vested remainder subject to open, when one being satisfies the condition, then that interest will render valid. Since Victor satisfied the age of 25 requirement, then his interest has vested and the class may close, rendering that interest to be valid under the RAP time period. Therefore the class is no longer open or has an indefinite time period, Vivian's age no longer matters since the interest has vested in Victor and he is the one to get the interest. The valid rewrite of the grant would be: ""to the first of my children to retire, for life, then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25"". 2) "," 1) a) Dear Brock: The issue seems to be that you are attempting to ""make some money from the developer"", in hopes that your property interest may allow you to override your brother's desire to remain on the property. Confusion may arise according to the way that the deed is written, whether you and you brother hold a tenancy in common or joint tenancy. Your property interest with your brother is a tenancy in common. (Martin, Craft) Tenancy in common provides that cotenants share an undivided, separate interest in the property as a whole. The language in the deed written by Alex was too ambiguous to allow any court to assume that you have a joint tenancy, since he said you ""hold jointly as tenants in common"". Tenancy in common provides that cotenants share an undivided, separate interest in the property as a whole. Therefore, your interests remain different than if you were tenants in common, where you would have a right of survivorship, retaining the property as a whole, if Alex ever passed away. Since you both equally paid for half of the business and half of the warehouse site, it would be safe to say that you own 50% of the property, which you may treat as you wish. Alex may argue that he was the first to acquire the business and the land, and that the has a significant investment both emotionally and monetarily in the property, and that he refuses to the sell the property regardlass of your argument. The simplest solution to make money from the developer would be to convince Alex to sell his portion of the property which he does not seem likely to do, since he has a personal attachment to the property. One option you have is to survivorship, retaining the property as a whole, if Alex ever passed away. Since you both equally paid for half of the business and half of the warehouse site, it would be safe to say that you own 50% of the property, which you may treat as you wish. Alex may argue that he was the first to acquire the business and the land, and that the has a significant investment both emotionally and monetarily in the property, and that he refuses to the sell the property regardlass of your argument. The simplest solution to make money from the developer would be to convince Alex to sell his portion of the property which he does not seem likely to do, since he has a personal attachment to the property. One option you have is to collect rent from Alex, through an accounting, if he ever rents the property to a third party. The reason that you could collect rent is that Alex's language essentially ousted you from the property when he said ""get out of here and don't come back"", he essentially forbids you from returning to the property and treating it as your own. (Martin) Alex may also argue against this and say that he will not pay you rent since a third party has not entered the property and you have not been officially ousted, he was simply reacting in a state of emotion. Another option you have is to sell your portion of the property, which also may be difficult to do since you're using the warehouse site as a business and Alex does not seem likely to sever separate from the interest, but this could easily be done with the 10 acres of land that are unused. Therefore since it is unlikely that Alex allows you to sell your portion of the property or retain rent, then you may need to discover alternative solutions which I describe below. Another option you may have is to bring this matter to court and ask them to decide on partition action. (Delfino) There are two versions of partition actions, the first is partition in kind, which physically divides the property proportionally between the cotenants allowing them each to have exclusive use of the property. Courts typically prefer partition in kind since this allows people to retain their property interest and not be forced off of their property. If there were an instance where the parties got a partition in kind and one of the parties got a significantly more valuable interest in the property, one of the parties may instructed to pay an owelty payment, a payment to compensate for the differentiation in the value of their interests. If a partition in kind is granted and Alex retains the distillery portion of the land, he may be forced to pay an owelty to Alex since this seems to be a significantly more valuable piece of the property. (Martin) The second type of partition is a partition by sale, which requires parties to sell the property and convey the amount sold for among themselves proportional to their shares. Courts typically only apply this type of partition by sale when three elements are met: 1) the physical attributes of the property make it difficult to divide the property, 2) the interests of the parties are better protected when selling the property and 3) the selling of the property does not significantly harm any of the parties. Brock will argue that the physical attributes the land may be difficuld to divide since a brewery would be the only valuable piece of the property and that the parties would benefit significantly from selling the land to the developing company for 2 million dollars, 4 times the price that they bought property and convey the amount sold for among themselves proportional to their shares. Courts typically only apply this type of partition by sale when three elements are met: 1) the physical attributes the property make it difficult to divide the property, 2) the interests of the parties are better protected when selling the property and 3) the selling of the property does not significantly harm any of the parties. Brock will argue that the physical attributes of the land may be difficuld to divide since a brewery would be the only valuable piece of the property and that the parties would benefit significantly from selling the land to the developing company for 2 million dollars, 4 times the price that they bought it for. Alex will likely argue that a partition by sale will hinder the fulfillment of his life goal to start his own distillery and that he has put in countless hours of work and passion into his business to see it grow. If Alex was forced to pick between the two, he will likely choose partition in kind, in which a court will likely let him keep the portion of the land with the brewery, since he is the one who is fulfilling his life dream by starting his own brewery. Similar to Delfino, where the woman's family operated a waste management business on the property for several years, the property became more than a parcel of land but a significant venture in their lives, which is a similar situation to Alex who is fulfilling his dream. Brock, you will likely argue that a partition in sale would be more beneficial to you two since the developing company is offering a significant amount of money, that you could use to buy land nearby and then have some leftover. There is also a public policy interest here in the growing city of Bostonia, where an economy will likely grow through tourism of a rapidly growing city, benefiting Brock's argument that the land should be sold. A court will likely rule in favor of Alex, if forced to choose between a partition and grant a partition in kind so they are not hindering on Alex's life goal, and leaving the portion of the property with the distillery to Alex, and the remaining acres to Brock. 1) b) Dear Carl: Carl will likely be wondering which type of finders law he will be able to benefit from in regards to the coins, growler and coat. The different categories of finders law include: lost, abondoned, mislaid, and treasure trove. Lost property, which is assumed to be genuinely lost by the owner in hopes of one day re-retrieving it, goes first to the original owner, if unable to find them, then to the first finder and then to the subsequent finder. Abondoned property, where the owner abondons title to the property and expresses no longer wanting it, goes to the finder, and the owner has no legal title to it. Mislaid property, when a property owner places something in a specific place and either forgets or intends to come, is the original owner's interest first, then the owner of the property 10 where it was found, assuming that the property owner will return for it, and the finder has no right to the property. Carl was bumped into by Brock on the grounds of Brock and Alex's distillery. When leaning down to get his cell phone, Carl re-retrieving it, goes first to the original owner, if unable to find them, then to the first finder and then to the subsequent finder. Abondoned property, where the owner abondons title to the property and expresses no longer wanting it, goes to the finder, and the owner has no legal title to it. Mislaid property, when a property owner places something in a specific place and either forgets or intends to come, is the original owner's interest first, then the owner of the property where it was found, assuming that the property owner will return for it, and the finder has no right to the property. Carl was bumped into by Brock on the grounds of Brock and Alex's distillery. When leaning down to get his cell phone, Carl discovered a hole in the warehouse wall where he found a mesh bag with gold coins. The bags of coins neatly placed in a tiny hole in the wall would be described as mislaid property, similar to the case of Benjamin where the money was tied into a wall, and declared by the court to go to the owner of the property. Carl could argue that these coins are clearly abondoned, and were wrapped in a bag of a grocery store from 10 years ago, which is a long period of time so the owner is unlikely to return and declare them as their own, therefore Carl has superior title since he is the finder. In conclusion, Carl will likely not have any legal title to the gold coins, and should return them back to the property where it was found, which belongs to Alex and Brock. The growler creates a bailor and bailee relationship between Carl and the brewery. The bailor is the person who has to act with a reasonable duty of care in regards to the bailee's property and the bailee is the one that is providing the property that is being exchange. The brewery provided tickets where you receive a number that matches the number on your growler, exchanging the two for a service. (Hyatt Regency) Similar to Hyatt, the system of tickets creates a bailor and bailee relationship where a reasonable person would expect their property to return undamaged and in its original or undamaged form. In terms of his growler, which is a sentimental piece of property to Carl, given to him by his dear friend, brought it to a distillery to get it filled, and when asking where it was, was informed that it was nowhere to be found or possibly broken. Therefore, since the bailee violated the reasonable duty of care, Carl can bring action for his growler, and since it provided a sentimental value to him, may be difficult to receive value for. The distillery may argue that they did not have a bailor or bailee relationship and are simply running their business in the manner of tickets, which will likely be a weak argument. The item could also be declared lost, and later found, in which case Alex will have superior title. A court will likely find a bailor and bailee relationship ruling that Carl may sue for the monetary value. In regards to Carl's coat, his actions create an abondonment of the item. When Carl yells ""forget it"", after not being able to find his coat and looking multiple times, and then heads home, then he no longer cares for this coat and has abondoned it entirely. If it is abandoned, then Carl has no legal title and any finder may keep it. Carl may argue that he yelled ""forget it"" in an anger and did not abondon the coat, item could also be declared lost, and later found, in which case Alex will have superior title. A court will likely find a bailor and bailee relationship ruling that Carl may sue for the monetary value. In regards to Carl's coat, his actions create an abondonment of the item. When Carl yells ""forget it"", after not being able to find his coat and looking multiple times, and then heads home, then he no longer cares for this coat and has abondoned it entirely. If it is abandoned, then Carl has no legal title and any finder may keep it. Carl may argue that he yelled ""forget it"" in an anger and did not abondon the coat, but lost it and attempted to look for it multiple times. If it is lost, Carl may retain ownership if it is found and given to him. The coat is most likely abondoned by Carl's actions, and no longer has any title to it, allowing any finder to keep it. 1) c) The issue at hand is the interests held by the parties and if they are violated by the actions conveyed by them. David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation, since he has a condition after his conveyance that could give it to a third party, who are David's sons who have an executory interest in the property. Therefore in 2017, when David violated the condition, to not use the property for any purpose other than residential use, it shifted to David's two sons who have an executory interest in the estate. David may argue that this condition is no longer applicable, since the residential development no longer makes sense, but this still violates the condition and voids his interest in the property. The second conveyance of the interest is a fee simple subject to condition subsequent or executory limitation, but it is clarified when Alex has a future interest in reentry. The right of reentry follows a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, which was an issue in the Marenholz case, when terminology of the conveyance of property may seem ambiguous, but it was ruled that it is typically at the court's discretion and the court's typically prefer the interest that does not directly revert back to the grantor, which would be fee simple defeasible, and that they prefer condition subsequent so that the grantor does not have dead-hand control for countless years. In this case, Alex is giving himself the right of reentry although he is the grantor so it would be acting as a reverter, so the result is the same in both instances. Alex holds the right of reentry, and since the condition has been violated to not sell IPA, since Alex loathes them, then Alex may exercise his right of reentry and reobtain the property. "," The first issue in the situation of Greenacre is that Andrew was unable to unilaterally sever the Tenancy by Entirety with Betty and sell their greenacre property. Tenants by the entirety are required to follow the 4 attributes of joint tenancy in addition to marriage. These four attributes are acquiring the property at the same time, by the same document, having an equal and undivided interest in the property and possession of the actual property. Although, Betty never went to the property, she still retained her interest in the property as a whole and when Andrew died, she also obtained his interest through the right of survivorship, then owning 100% of the property. The right of survivorship conveys the other parties interest to the surviving party when they pass, overriding any will. Since Andrew forged her name on the property, this will be difficult to win as an argument, since the deed was received by Andrew in good faith, so Andrew's daughter (since he is dead), Debbie could argue title of color in this instance. Title of color is when a piece of property is obtained in good faith, and a problem with the document (forged signature) at no fault of the buyer, renders their interest property to be invalid, then the title of color could save their interest in the property. Betty will argue that she owns 100% of the property and never wanted to sell it, even though she did not use the property, she has the right to do so and her husband went behind her back to convey the property to Andrew in the first place. Debbie will argue that it has been almost 18 years since her father bought the property from her husband, who has since passed and no legal action can be brought against him, and that the father obtained the land in good faith under the impression that deed and everything on it was valid and accurate. It is likely that Debbie will win this argument, since Betty has had no contact with the property and Debbie would reign superior when using the title of color argument, since her father obtained the land in good faith. Another issue that arises in Greenacre is the possible adverse possession claim that could be made by Debbie. It is not typical that this situation takes place where a forged document is used to obtain a property and then use adverse possession to further strengthen the argument but this is what we must do. Debbie could argue that she also obtained right to the land through adverse possession, fulfilling all requirements including an expiration of the statute of limitations for that jurisdiction, and satisfying the following elements: 1) actual use of the property 2) notorious and open use of the property (to notify the owner that she is there) 3) exclusive use of the property 4) continuous use of the property 5) and hostile use of the property (without permission of the owner). The statute of limitations piece of this adverse possession claim is satisfied in this case, Debbie acquired the property in 2009 when her father died, and moved their full-time in 2011. Most statute of limitation periods vary, but if the court finds there to be an issue with the amount of years, Debbie could also argue that she can tack on the years of her father's prior possession to satisfy this element. Her father would have been there for an addition 9 following elements: 1) actual use of the property 2) notorious and open use of the property (to notify the owner that she is there) 3) exclusive use of the property 4) continuous use of the property 5) and hostile use of the property (without permission of the owner). The statute of limitations piece of this adverse possession claim is satisfied in this case, Debbie acquired the property in 2009 when her father died, and moved their full-time in 2011. Most statute of limitation periods vary, but if the court finds there to be an issue with the amount of years, Debbie could also argue that she can tack on the years of her father's prior possession to satisfy this element. Her father would have been there for an addition 9 years, totaling 18 years of possession by their family to the day Betty arrives. Tacking of years of possession comes from the case of Tieu v. Morgan, it also requires privity between the parties, which is voluntary conveyance of the property in order to satisfy the statute of limitations period, which is the case here since her father left her the property when he died. Since statute of limitations is not an issue here, we must discuss the other requirements of adverse possession. An actual possession of the property has been fulfilled by Debbie since she built a home and physically lives there year-round, in addition to starting a lovely garden on the property. The element of open and notorious use is fulfilled since she is not hiding her use of the property, and if Betty made a routine inspection of the property, she would clearly be able to see the house that Debbie build and lived on. Betty may argue that this is not enough of an open and notorious use since she was never notified of her use of the property, but the court only held that if she was making routine inspections of the property, then Betty would have been able to been notified by the use. (Marengo Cave) Marengo Cave is a case where the other party was living under the ground of the property, and although the original owner was there everyday they were never notified that they were living there, which differs from our case here where Betty lives on the property everday. Exclusive use of the property has been fulfilled since Debbie lives on the property on her own, and isn't renting it out to anyone, and although she lets her neighbors use it to hunt, she does not let them continuously use the area that she lives. Betty may argue that the ability for neighbors to hunt on the property voids the exclusive use of the property, but the court will likely find this to be invalid since Debbie is exclusively living in her home on the property and excluding strangers. Continuous use of the property has been fulfilled since Debbie lives there year-round, but Betty may argue that she is not continuously using all of the property, since she never ventures on the other two- acres of land, but Debbie is not required to do so in order to satisfy continuous use. The hostile element has been windeled down by courts to mean without the owner's permission, which is the case here since Betty will attempt to take the property back from Debbie. Courts vary in their interpretations of hostile, some require good faith mistake of not having permission, and others require an objective standard, that the possessor did not themselves know that they did not have permission (Cahill, Manillo). Debbie has clearly satisfied all elements of adverse possession, and Betty's lack of interest in the property for argue that she is not continuously using all of the property, since she never ventures on the other two- acres of land, but Debbie is not required to do so in order to satisfy continuous use. The hostile element has been windeled down by courts to mean without the owner's permission, which is the case here since Betty will attempt to take the property back from Debbie. Courts vary in their interpretations of hostile, some require good faith mistake of not having permission, and others require an objective standard, that the possessor did not themselves know that they did not have permission (Cahill, Manillo). Debbie has clearly satisfied all elements of adverse possession, and Betty's lack of interest in the property for several years, coupled with her hubsnad's forgery of her signature are the reasons that Debbie will be successful in claiming adverse possession in Greenacre.

88b8c7fa-b807-4ab3-b690-602e4b0787aa," Prior to the application of the Rule against perpetuities, Connor and Carla have executory interests subject to condition. Robert has a remainder in a life estate. The grandchildren have contingent remainders in Fee simple. The rule against perpetuities is applicable to contingent remainders, executory interests and vested remainders subject to open. Therefore, Robert's interest is not subject to the rule against perpetuities The rule of convinience would apply to the interests of the grandchildren because Victor satisfies the condition of the age limit. The other grandchild, Vivian who does not satisfy the condition can latch on to ther brother per the rule of convinience. The class of the grandchildren can close under this rule. Oliver and his chilren are still alive so they can continue to have children and prevent the class from closing. Therefore, at the time of the grant the rule of convinience would apply and close the class. "," Essay Question 1a) The issue is whether Brock can sever the tenancy in common with his brother and sell the land to the real estate developer? Based on the lanugauge of the deed, it can be construed that Brock owns the property as tenants in common with his brother Alex. A tenancy in common does not have a right of survivorship which means that upon the death of one of the brothers it does not pass on to the other joint tenant. It would instead go to the heirs of the deceased tenant. Partition occurs when the co-tenats can no longer agree on the management of the property. The two types of partitions are: partition in kind where the property is physically divided among the tenants, and partition in sale where the land is sold and the proceeds are divided among the co-tenants. When partitioning property, court's generally prefer partitions in kind over partitions in sale. However, in reality partitions in sale are more common. If Brock is adament on making money from the developer he means that upon the death of one of the brothers it does not pass on to the other joint tenant. It would instead go to the heirs of the deceased tenant. Partition occurs when the co-tenats can no longer agree on the management of the property. The two types of partitions are: partition in kind where the property is physically divided among the tenants, and partition in sale where the land is sold and the proceeds are divided among the co-tenants. When partitioning property, court's generally prefer partitions in kind over partitions in sale. However, in reality partitions in sale are more common. If Brock is adament on making money from the developer he would prefer a partition by sale. Alex on the other hand, has significantly invested in the enterprise, both financially and emotionally so he would not want a partition by sale. In determining which partition to order to resolve the matter, the court's look to see which partition would better promote the interests of the co-tenants and if it would be difficult or impracticable to partition the property by kind. If the structure of the brewery is conviniently located on the side of the 10 acres of land then the court will most likely favor a partition in kind because it would not be impossible to physically divide their interests in land. For example, in Delfino v. Vealencis, the court favored a partition in kind because one of the co-tenants earned her livelihood from her business which was situated on the opposite end of the property from the other co-tenant. In the present case, the brewery is a successful startup and Alex has plans for expanding the business. The brewery is his livelihood and he has a strong argument for a partition in kind. To persuade the court to hold in his favor, Brock can argue that the land developer is offering to pay $2 million for the property which Alex bought for $500,000. He can argue that the money would better serve their interests because it could give Alex an opportunity to expand his business elsewhere. It is unclear as to where on the 10 acres of land the brewery is located which is crucial in determining the partition to sever the interests of the two co-tenants. Based on the analysis, the court will likely favor a partition in kind. 1b) Dear Carl, The issue your situation raises is whether you can keep the embedded gold coins that you found at the brewery. Items embedded in a property generally belong to the owner of the premises on which they were found. Therefore, if the property owners find out about the gold coins they have a superior clailm to them. An implied bailment occurs when the bailor entrusts his property to a bailee. To retrieve your growler, you can raise the argument that when you were given the ticket and an implied bailment was Dear Carl, The issue your situation raises is whether you can keep the embedded gold coins that you found at the brewery. Items embedded in a property generally belong to the owner of the premises on which they were found. Therefore, if the property owners find out about the gold coins they have a superior clailm to them. An implied bailment occurs when the bailor entrusts his property to a bailee. To retrieve your growler, you can raise the argument that when you were given the ticket and an implied bailment was created. The bartender was a under a duty of reasonable care to take care of you growler. Therefore, you have a good argument for collecting damages on the growler. You can use argue that another bailment was created when you hung your coat on the coat hook on by the front door. The hooks by the door give a reaonsonable impresion that the owner of the premises will prevent it from being stolen. 1c) The issues are whether Alex has a right to re-enter and take the property from Edward and if his children can take property from David? A Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent implies a right of entry or power of termination as future interest in the grantor. A Fee Simple Determinable implies a possibility of reverter in the grantor. A Fee Simple subject to executory limitation implies an executory interest in the Grantee or other third party. Based on the language of the conveyance to David, it seems that David was granted a Present Possessory interest subject to an executory limitation in Fee Simple. Frank and Fred recieved future executory interests. The grant to David is defeasible because Alex wanted to have strings attached to the property by placing a limitation on it. If David does not follow the directions in the conveyance and uses the property for non-residential purposes then the future interests of Frank and Fred will cut short David's present possessory interest. Based on the language of the conveyance, it seems that Edward Elixir was given a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent with a future interest in the Grantor, which means that Alex has a right to entry or power of termination. The conditional language in the deed which prohibits making IPAs is indicative of a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent. Usually, the durational language in the conveyance, words like (""so long as"") are usually indicative of a Fee Simple Determinable where the future interest in the Grantor is different. If the Grantee does not follow the directions in the conveyance, then the property automatically goes back to the grantor because the implied future interest of a Fee Simple with ambiguity, the court's tend to prefer a FS Determinable is the possibility of reverter. When faced Subject to Condition Subsequent because it requires that the grantor take an additional step to exercise his right of entry or power of termination. If Edward starts making IPAs on the property then Alex must of a Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent. Usually, the durational language in the conveyance, words like (""so long as"") are usually indicative of a Fee Simple Determinable where the future interest in the Grantor is different. If the Grantee does not follow the directions in the conveyance, then the property automatically goes back to the grantor because the implied future interest of a Fee Simple Determinable is the possibility of reverter. When faced with ambiguity, the court's tend to prefer a FS Subject to Condition Subsequent because it requires that the grantor take an additional step to exercise his right of entry or power of termination. If Edward starts making IPAs on the property then Alex must excercise his right of entry or termination to reclaim possession. If Alex fails to do so then the land will belong to Edward. Based on the analysis, Alex can raise the claim David has violated the condition of the conveyance therefore his children can take possession of the land. In regards to the legal claim against Edward, Alex can take a step to exercise his right of entry or power of termination to reclaim the property. "," The issue is whether Debbies owns Greenacre via adverse possession under a color of title? Tenancy by the entirety has a right of survivorship and requires the four unities of Possession, Interest, Time and Title + marriage. Severance of a tenancy by the entirety requires a divorce or a contract. Color of Title is when a person is given property through an invalid instrument.To make a claim of adverse possession, the statute of limitations must run, which depends on jurisdiction and the adverse possessor must satisfy the five common law elements (1) continuous (2) hostile or adverse under a claim of right, (3) open and notorious, (4) actual, and (5) exclusive. Possession is continuous when a single possessor continously possess the land. The concept of tacking enables a succession of adverse possessors to collectively satisfy the statutory period. However, tacking is only allowed when the old and new owner are in privity meaning there is consensual and voluntary transfer of property. Tieu v. Morgan Hostile requires that one must be possessing the property without the permission of the title owner. To be open and notorious, the possessor must use it in a way to put the title owner on actual or constructive notice. To be actual the possessor must enter onto the property. Exclusive requires the the adverse possessor use the property with the right to exlcude other trespassers from the property. The best argument Betty can raise to reclaim Greence is that Andrew's conveyance of the house with her forged signature does not give legal title to his friend Chris. Upon, Andrew's death, his interest in the title owner. To be open and notorious, the possessor must use it in a way to put the title owner on actual or constructive notice. To be actual the possessor must enter onto the property. Exclusive requires the the adverse possessor use the property with the right to exlcude other trespassers from the property. The best argument Betty can raise to reclaim Greence is that Andrew's conveyance of the house with her forged signature does not give legal title to his friend Chris. Upon, Andrew's death, his interest in the property ceased to exist and it automatically went to her and she now owns all of Greenacre. Debbie can raise the defense that although she was given Greenacre under a color of title, she owns the property by virtue of adverse possession. Debbie's use of Greenacre indicates that she lives and treats the property as her own. Betty can argue that Chris died in 2009 and Debbie's use of the property is not continuous because she moved on the property full time in 2011. Betty can further ague that Debbie's use of the property is not exlcusive because neighbors hunt on her property. Debbie can raise the counterargument and say that she gives permission to the neighbors to hunt on the property. Debbie can argue that she meets the continuous element of adverse possession because of the concept of tacking. She can add the years her father possessed Greenacre to her claim because they were in privity. There was a voluntary transfer of Greenacre upon his death. Debbie can argue that her claim is hostile because she of the conveyance. Her use of Greenacre is open and notorious because she built a year round house and cleared the woods in the area to make a garden for herself. The neighbors in the area know that Debbie owns the property. Her use of Greenacre is actual because she is physically present on the property. Her use is exlusive because she can exclude the neighbors from hunting on the land. Furthermore, they need her permission to enter the two acres around her house. Debbie can also use the policy rationale for adverse possession to make her claim even stronger because she has been productively using the property by letting neighbors hunt and fish on her property. She can argue that adverse possession serves the core values of property law by rewarding productive use of property. It prevents sleeping owners from sleeping owners on their rights and overtime sleeping owners interests yield to adverse possessor's reliance interest. Betty can argue that adverse possession is in infringement on her property rights and it promotes overproduction and overexploitation of land. She can argue that Debbie has cleared the area of trees which constitutes waste. Based on the analysis, the court will likely award Greenacre to Debbie because she has been in possession of the land beyond the statutory period of 10 years. Although she never ventures beyond the two acres she has title to all the land because the title owner, Betty was nowhere on the property. adverse possession is in infringement on her property rights and it promotes overproduction and overexploitation of land.

f346f20d-4883-4fea-af93-f716f6e99274," Without applying Rules agianst Perpetuities (RAP), Oliver has a life estate subject to executory limitation. Oliver's 1st child to retire has an executory interest in life estate becuase Oliver will only lose his interest once one of his children retires. Robert has a vested remainder in life estate. Victor has a vested remainder in an open class subject to partial divestment in fee simple because he has already satisfied the requirement of reaching the age of 25 and it is in an open class because more grandchildren can be added if they reach age of 25. Vivian has a contingent remainder in fee simple because she is not yet 25. Oliver's granchildren that are not listed above also have a contingent remiander in fee simple because they are not born yet and they have to meet a condition precedent of reaching age of 25 before they can attain the fee simple. For RAP to be valid the interest must certainly vest or fail within 21 years of a life in being in a closed class. RAP applies to contingent remainders, executory interests, vested remainder in an open class, and option contracts. The interest of the 1st child to retire, Victor, Vivian, and any other granchildren's interest are subject to RAP. Oliver could have another child after Connor and Carla both die, never retiring and then that child would be an afterborn child, which means that Oliver could die the next day, and the afterborn child would not be able to retire in the 21 years and they can not be their own validating lives. Rules of convience can come into the picture because Victor has already satisifed the class, so since Vivian is alive, then her contingent remainder is fine as well. Victor's is fine because he has already satisfied the condition. Now if one of Oliver's children, like Connor, has an afterborn child, then that condition would not be satisfied and it would be void under RAP because Connor could die the day after the child is born and there is no way that the afterborn child would live to 25, they would only be 22. When one member of a class fails, then all of the classes fail. So all interests subject to RAP would be void. Rewritten, the interests created would be Oliver has a life estate. Robert has a vested remainder in life estate. "," 1a: Propery intersts of Brock To begin, Brock and Alex share a concurrent ownership of the 10 acres where the brewrey is on as tenants in common, which means that they each hold an undivided share of the whole property. Here, they both have a 1/2 interest in the property. There is no language of right of survivorship, and the deed was clearly written as to say ""jointly as tenants in common"", so there is no ambigious writing here. The issue here is Brock has already tried to bring the idea of selling the 10 acres to the real estate developer and Alex refuses to sell, so the question here is what can Brock do. The best option for Brock is to ask the court to order a partition so that the property can either be sold at auction or divided into equal shares of what each co tenant owns. The first option is a partition in kind which is where the property will be divided physically between the two men among the shares they hold. Brock can assume that there is a 50/50 interest because he has put in half of the money for both the business and warehouse. If a parition in kind is done, Brock could negotiate with Alex and see if he would consider only taking the land that the warehouse is on and where the on-site tasing room is. Alex will likley not agree to this because Bostonia is growing rapidly and Alex may want to expand his business. If Alex did agree to this, then it would probably be on the terms that Alex will want to be offset by what Brock gets when he sells his portion of the land to the real estate developer, but only if the real estate developer still chooses buy for less than what he originally wanted. The second option is better for Brock and having the court order a partition by sale. That means that the land will be auctioned off and each co tenant will get their share of the profits. A court will only order a partition by sale if a partition in kind is inequitable or impractiable due to how the land is set up and if it is better option for all of the interests for each co tenant. Looking to Delfino, that court ordered a partition in kind because there were only 2 parites and one of the tenants had their garabage business that was doing well and had been on the land for decades. This court will likely order a partition in kind, which will leave each co tenant with 1/ the land, which means that the real estate developer will most The second option is better for Brock and having the court order a partition by sale. That means that the land will be auctioned off and each co tenant will get their share of the profits. A court will only is set order a partition by sale if a partition in kind is inequitable or impractiable due to how the land up and if it is better option for all of the interests for each co tenant.

This court will likely order a partition in kind, which will leave each co tenant with 1/ the land, which means that the real estate developer will most likley not want to buy from Brock because they originaly wanted 10 acres not five. Best option for Brock is to speak to his brother if a parition in kind were to be done and see if Alex would take less land. 1b: Carl's Legal Rights The coins that Carl have found are going to be in the category of either mislaid or treasure trove property. Carl is going to want to argue that the coins are treasure trove and the Bar will argue that they are mislaid property. The issue is what category will the coins be put in. Mislaid property means that someone placed their item in an intentional place, but then forgot about where they placed them. This type of property will go to the original owner if they can be found, but if not to the owner of the property where it was found. If the coins are mislaid that means that Carl has no property rights in it and since the coins were found in the warehouse wall and were kept in a mesh bag, the Bar could argue that the coins were intentionally placed there, but the original owner forgot to come back and get them. Treasure trove are gold/coins that have been buried underneath the property and it belongs first to the true owner of the coins, if they are alive, and then to the finder. The court in Corills v. Wenner chose not to use the doctrine of treasure trove because they wanted to discourage thieves from tresspassing on other's property, but the court in this case would find that Carl was not tresspassing so there is no reason to discredit that doctrine. Carl would argue that the coins fit into the category of treasure trove because lthough they were not buried underground like traditionally, after getting appraised they were from the 1800s and they are coins, so that fits into the type of property that treasure trove applies to. Carl will lose his points he made about the coins being treasure trove because the coins were labeled and had the name of a grocery store on it which implies that they were intentionlly put there and maybe were hidden for a good reason. Overall, Carl will most likely hold no interest in the property because the court will likley identify the coins as mislaid propery, like in the case about the people finding 18k wrapped up in plastic bags on an airplane (Linder), and that court gave the money to the bank because they were the owner of the property where it was 4found, in this case of the plane itself. 1c: Alex's claims for his 10 acres and had the name of a grocery store on it which implies that they were intentionlly put there and maybe were hidden for a good reason. Overall, Carl will most likely hold no interest in the property because the court will likley identify the coins as mislaid propery, like in the case about the people finding 18k wrapped up in plastic bags on an airplane (Linder), and that court gave the money to the bank because they were the owner of the property where it was found, in this case of the plane itself. 1c: Alex's claims for his 10 acres Alex has given David a fee simple subject to executory limitation and given Frank and Fred an executory interest in fee simple. Alex has no right in this property anymore because he has conveyed all of his interests to David and Daivd can lose the 5 acres to Frank and Fred. Once David has stopped using the property soley for residential uses, then his interest gets conveyed to Frank and Fred because David was subject to Alex's condition he set on the conveyance. The deed uses the language of ""so long as"" but that language is not relevant because David can lose it to a third party, not the grantor, which in this case is Alex. Alex has given Edward a fee simple determinable with Alex having a possiblity of reverter. The issue is that the language of Alex's conveyance to Edward is ambigious because the interest conveyed to Edward has the language of time ""so long as"", but then the interest that Alex has says ""Alex has the right to re-enter and reclaim the premises"" and that seems to be language of right of entry, when means Alex would have to exercise his right to get the 5 acres back. In the Mahrenholz case, the court determined that the langugae created was not of condition but of time and added in ""so long as"" and gave the Huttons a possibilty of reverter so that they would get the land back immediately if it was not used for school purposes. Here, the court will likely say that Alex did mean to give a fee simple determinable with a possiblity of reverter, because Alex feels so strongly about hating IPA's. Once Edward has begun making IPA on the property, Alex automatically gets his interest in the land back. So the interests in the property now, should be that Frank and Fred have a fee simple absolute of the 5 acres without the warehouse and Alex has a fee simple absolute in the 5 acres with the warehouse. 3) "," 2: Claims to Greenacre from Betty and Debbie Since Betty and Andrew were tenants by the entirety, that means they have a right of survivorship; when one spouse dies the other gets all of the interests and property. The property, Greenacre, was included in this type of concurrent ownership and once Andrew died, it gave Betty all of the rights to Greenacre. The issue presented is if Debbie has any ownership rights to Greenacre because she acquired the property through a bad deed. Betty is going to argue that Debbie has no rights because she owns Greenacre in all of its entirety because she never signed the papers to sell the property and when you own property through a tenant by the entirety you must have both signatures if you want to sell the property and Andrew forged her signature without her knowledge or consent. They never got divorced, so their concurrent ownership was never severed. Debbie is going to claim that she adversly possessed Greenacre, at least the 2 acres of it, becuase it has been 8 years and the period you have to adversly possess property is between 5 and 30 years, so she may meet that element; it depends what the statue is in her state. If the requirement is 10 years then she has met it because Chris was her dad and he occuped it for 8 years prior to Debbie acquiring the property and there would have been a voluntary conveyance of the land since it was through a deed. Next she will claim she had all of the elements of adverse possession; open/notorious, continuous, exclusive, actual, and hostile. Open because at any time Betty could have went to this property, continuously because she moved there from 2011 and has lived there through 2019, execlusive becaue she has told the hunters they cannot use the 2 acres that the house is on, actual because she is physically there, and hostile because she acted in good faith believing that she had the right to use it and it was legally her land. Betty is going to state that she cannot adversely possess it because it was not open/notorious because Betty is the true owner and she was never put on actual notice that the property was being used or that it was even sold. Debbie could also claim color of title because she thought the deed was legally conveyed, but it was not, so she could use that claim to say she met all of the requirements of possessing it. In Marengo Cave v Ross, the court held that Marengo did not adversly possess the cave because their use was not open/notorious or exclusive. It was not open/notorious because Ross did not even know that he owned that property and when asked if he could get it surveyed, Marengo said no. It was not exclusive because both parties were simitanousely using the cave at the same time, Ross using the property above and Marengo using the cave which was below the ground. A court would use this ruling regarding the open/notorious element because Betty was never put on notice and had no idea conveyed, but it was not, so she could use that claim to say she met all of the requirements of possessing it.

cfa09378-0303-42fb-9ff1-066c8e2f7e88," Connor and Carla both have a contingent remainder interest in life estate, as it will go to whichever one of them stops working first. Robert has a vested remainder in life estate. Victor being already over the age of the grant also has a defeasible vested remainder subject to open in fee simple. Vivian has a contingent remainder in fee simple. This grant is valid under the rule against perpetuties since anyone in the grant can be a validating life. "," The main issue here is what rights does Brock have as a tennant in common. As a tenant in common, Brock has equal property rights to his brother Alex. This is evidenced by his paying Alex a sum of money for part of the business and warehouse. So, Brock owns half of the 10 acres the warehouse is on and half of the business. Brock could argue that the New Suffolk courts should follow the jurisdiction of Marlon where tenants in common owned 1/8th of the land they were on, meaning they were allowed 1/8th of the revenue the land produced. Since Brock is entitled to half the revenue of the land, he is also entitled to sell his portion of it. However, as shown in the case wherein a woman did not want to alienate her garbage collection business in order to sell the land to a developer, the courts decided that since she had been using that land to run a profitable business, they could not make her alienate it even if the land was more valuable for residential purposes. So, she was allowed to keep her section the business ran on, but had to sell the rest of the land for whatever the market value was. In addition, she also had to pay an owlety to the other tenant in common as part of the deal. If Brock wants to sell his share of the land, he may run into a similar problem where Alex is allowed to keep the business (which might be more profitable than residential homes), but could recieve an owlety if 2the courts deem it appropriate. Still, there is evidence that the business is successful as they have sold their beer locally, opened a tasting room, and a small restaurant on the property. To conclude, while Brock might be able to argue to sell the land at the good for residential purposes.

Essay Question 1B Dear Mr. Cask, The first issue is whether you are allowed to keep the gold coins you have found. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that you will be able to keep the coins. The coins will likely be considered mislaid property under a Medina court. In this case a woman left her purse in a barber shop and was allowed to get it back after it was found by someone else. Mislaid property is different from lost property, as it is usually intentionally left somewhere with the intention of the owner to reclaim it at a later time. Since you found the coins in a mesh bag of a local grocery store that opened ten years ago, that means the coins were almost certainly recently placed there intentionally by one of the owners of the brewery with an intention to reclaim them at a later date. The property owners could also make additional arguments citing Corliss, where an agent of an employee found gold coins on a landowners property. In this instance, the coins were found to be the property of the landowner. Even if the coins had been in the property for hundreds of years, they would likely belong to the owners of the property they were on. Finally, the owners could also cite Armory which rules that a finder of property has the next best claim against the original owner of it. If the owner can prove that the coins are theirs, you will certainly lose. All in all, it is extremely unlikely you will be allowed to keep the coins. Still, there are a few arguments that you can use. First, you could try to cite treasure-trove laws, which state the finder of a treasure trove, like gold coins, is the rightful owner of them. While the coins are from the late 1800s and almost 200 years old, they could qualify, if not found in the mesh shopping bag. Another argument you could use is that the coins 3were abandonded and therefore should go to the finder. Again, the coins being found in a shopping bag that is a maximum of ten years old refute this idea. Additionally, you could argue that since you are not an employee of the brewery Corliss shouldn't All in all, it is extremely unlikely you will be allowed to keep the coins. Still, there are a few arguments that you can use. First, you could try to cite treasure-trove laws, which state the finder of a treasure trove, like gold coins, is the rightful owner of them.

Another argument you could use is that the coins were abandonded and therefore should go to the finder. Again, the coins being found in a shopping bag that is a maximum of ten years old refute this idea. Additionally, you could argue that since you are not an employee of the brewery Corliss shouldn't apply. However, courts are unlikely to find this argument convincing as you are still voluntarily allowed onto the property, similar to how an owner would let an agent onto their property for work. None of these arguments are likely to work. The next issue is about your growler. It is possible that a bailment was created for it, similar to the Hyatt Regency Hotels case. In that case a parking attendant watched over a public parking garage with one entrance in and out, and the courts found that the garage should have had enough control over the car for it to be considered a bailment. In this case, by giving you a ticket and hannding over the growler to an employee of the business, this is likely sufficient enough for the courts to find the create of a bailment. The business had control of the growler and by losing it or breaking it, violated the terms of the bailment. So, it is likely you can get damages for the value of the growler, but even if you claim it had sentimental value since it was given to you by a friend, it is unlikely you can get additional damages. The issue of the coat is a somewhat trickier matter. It is unlikely that you will be able to recover for it since there was no bailment created by the brewery. If there was a coat check and you had a receipt it would be a different story, but since it was just on a hook by the doorway, the most likely answer is someone else took it by accident, in which case the brewery will be no way liable. Sincerely, Your Lawyer Essay Question 1C Alex's first issue is whether he has any claim against David for going against the terms of sale and creating commercial stores on the property.

Since David agreed to the sale under these terms, his interest in the land is a fee simple subject to executory interest. Alex's sons Frank and Fred have a shifting executory interest in fee simple, as they have a possibility of getting the land if David voids the agreement. David has to build non residential units on the land before Frank and Fred have a valid claim to it however, simply planning to do so is not enough to shift the interests. Since David has not actually built the commercial spaces yet, Frank and Fred's interest is still have a remainder interest. If the deed is valid, then Alex's sons will have the present interest of the land as soon as David builds his first store. Alex's next issue is with Edward Elixar deciding to make IPAs on the property. Edward has a defeasible fee simple subject to executory limitation. Alex has a right of entry if Edward ever decides to make IPAs on the premises. Similar to Alex's issue with David, Alex's claim is not valid until the first IPA is brewed on the property. There is a difference between deciding to make IPAs and actually making them, so Alex cannot excercise his claim until Edward actually does so. If Edward does begin to make IPAs on the five acres, including the warehouse, will revert back to Alex. 5) "," The first issue to examine is whether Debbie has an adverse possession claim to the land she is on. The New Suffolk statute for adverse possession states legal action must be brought within ten years after the cause of action is then accrued. So, Debbie had only been living on the property for eight years when Betty came, meaning that if the adverse possession began in 2011, when Debbie began living there full time, Betty would win easily. However, Debbie could argue that the adverse possession claim began in 2001 when her father Chris unknowingly purchased a foraged deed. If it began then, then the property would have been in the family for 18 years, easily clearing the statute. The element to consider here is continuity, which places the onus on the adverse possesor to use the land like an actual owner would over a consistent period of time. This can be seen in a case like Pimental where the owners of the land used it continuously as part of their garden and back yard for an extensive period of time, treating the land like there own. Chris used the land regularly from 2001-2009 showing up consistently during fishing season. Since it was a cabin in a remote area in the mountains, this useage is consistent with how a true owner would use the land. would have been in the family for 18 years, easily clearing the statute. The element to consider here is continuity, which places the onus on the adverse possesor to use the land like an actual owner would over a consistent period of time. This can be seen in a case like Pimental where the owners of land the used it continuously as part of their garden and back yard for an extensive period of time, treating the land like there own. Chris used the land regularly from 2001-2009 showing up consistently during fishing season. Since it was a cabin in a remote area in the mountains, this useage is consistent with how a true owner would use the land. The question of continuity then arises when Chris died in 2009 and Debbie began living there full time in 2011. A two year gap would almost certainly break the continuity requirement for an adverse possessor, resetting the claim to begin in 2011. However, Debbie could argue that if she began building the full time house there soon after her father died, this would constitute using the property like a real owner and would keep it continuous, meaning she would gain real title to the property in 2011, ten years after her father bought the illicit deed. On the other hand, if Debbie spent a year deliberating what to do with the land before deciding to build a full time house there, this could break the adverse possession claim. Since the fact pattern does not state what she did between 2009-2011 it must be assumed that each possibility is equally likely. In the event she did satisfy the continuity requirement, the rest of the elements of adverse possession must be examined. The next element is actual, which means were the possesors truly on the land during this time. This is an easy yes in favor of Debbie and Chris as there is plenty of evidence that they were both on the land for enough time to qualify. Chris was there during fishing season and Debbie lived there full time beginning in 2011. After that is hostile, which entails the possesor to use the land as a true owner would, not hiding their actions. Debbie and Chris again meet this requirement. They both allowed their neighbors to use the land to hunt and fish like the last true owner Andrew did. Chris also used the land to relax like Andrew did, taking long walks in the extensive woods around the property. While Debbie is not the outdoorsy type, she loves the area that Greenacre is located in and spends extensive time outside in her formal garden. The second to last element is exclusive, which means they kept people off the land pursuant to how the true owners would. Even if both Debbie and Chris allowed people to hunt and fish on most of the land, for most of the year, this seems to be pursuant for the customs of the area. Andrew was likely allowed to hunt and fish on his neighbors property as well,6 as was Chris, and likely Debbie if she so desired. So, Debbie and Chris also likely satisfy the nature of the exclsuive element. garden. The second to last element is exclusive, which means they kept people off the land pursuant to how the true owners would. Even if both Debbie and Chris allowed people to hunt and fish on most of the land, for most of the year, this seems to be pursuant for the customs of the area. Andrew was likely allowed to hunt and fish on his neighbors property as well, as was Chris, and likely Debbie if she so desired. So, Debbie and Chris also likely satisfy the nature of the exclsuive element. The final element is open and notorious. This aspect of adverse possession examines if the possessors were trying to hide their actions and if they made improvements to the land. It is obvious that Chris and Debbie did not try to hide their actions as they talked to their neighbors and used the land how true owners would. They both made improvements to it with Chris enlarging and insulating the cabin and Debbie creating a year round house and a formal garden. A court would likely find they satisifed this element as well. So, if the court examined the evidence in a light favorable to Debbie, they would find it likely that she satisfied the adverse possession claim. However, Betty has two strong arguments that she can use in her favor. Her first would be to try to argue that there was a gap in the continuity of the possession between 2009 and 2011. If Betty can prove that Debbie did not use the land like a true owner during this time and there was a break in continuity, this would shatter Debbie's adverse possession claim and guarantee a win for Betty. Betty's other option would be to file a quiet title action, claiming that she still had the true deed since Andrew forged her name. Debbie could respond witha few things here. First, since Betty hadn't visited the land in 18 years, and probably even longer, she was no longer being productive with it and acting like a true owner should. Even if it was just to occasionaly survey the property once a year, she should still see what it looks like. Also, Debbie could contend that the quiet title suit does not matter to an adverse possession claim, since Debbie and Chris were acting under the presumption they owned the real title the entire time. Finally, in many jurisdictions people in tenanancy by entirety, usually marriage, are allowed to sign for each other on legal documents. This is becuase they share everything, including their legal rights, since marriage allows for several specific rights not usually found in people who do not have the legal status. So, there is a possibility that Andrew's forging of Betty's name on the document doesn't even matter. In conclusion, while Betty has some claims to the7property, especially if she can prove that the continuity of the claim was broken, the courts will likely find in favor of Debbie and her family, which have been acting like the true owners of Greenacre since 2001.

RAP applies to contingent remainders, vested remainders subject to open, and executory interests. Rule of convenience does not work here, unless Oliver dies, then the vested remainder subject to open would close. RAP seeks to eliminate dead hand control. The rule for RAP is that the interest must vest or fail at grantors death + 21 years after that. RAP does not apply to his children, because they just have a life estate. It wouldn't apply to Robert because he just has a vested remainder. This is a will because it takes creation at the death of Oliver. The worst-case life is Robert's kids. RAP is valid for his grandchildren's interest because Oliver could die tomorrow and we will know whether the interest will vest or fail with his grandchildren. Either Victor will be 26, in which the class would close, and he would get the property in fee simple, or Vivian will be 25, and the interest will fail. We will know whether or not he has grandchildren that are alive and at the age of 25. "," The issue is whether or not Brock can convey his interest to the developer. The language unambiguously states that they are tenants in common, saying ""jointly"" is not enough for the co-tenants to be joint tenants.The rule for tenancy in common is that both of the co-tenants may own different fractional shares of the property, but they both have access to the whole thing. The big difference between tenancy in common and joint tenancy is that with tenancy in common Brock can convey his interest to someone else in a will or deed, which is not the case with joint tenancy. Brock: For Brock to ""make some money from this developer"" he could do a partition of the land. There are two kinds of partition; partition in kind (in which the land is split up equatibly and fairly among the one co-tenant to sell their land. However, it is cotenants. the courts prefer this because it doesn't2force harder in practice because it is hard for courts to figure out how to fairy and equitably divide up different fractional interests in the land. The rule for partition from Delfino is that courts prefer partition between tenancy in common and joint tenancy is that with tenancy in common Brock can convey his interest to someone else in a will or deed, which is not the case with joint tenancy. Brock: For Brock to ""make some money from this developer"" he could do a partition of the land. There are two kinds of partition; partition in kind (in which the land is split up equatibly and fairly among the cotenants. the courts prefer this because it doesn't force one co-tenant to sell their land. However, it is harder in practice because it is hard for courts to figure out how to fairy and equitably divide up different fractional interests in the land. The rule for partition from Delfino is that courts prefer partition in kind because it doesn't force someone to sell their land. Brock will argue that this should be a partition by sale, which is used only when more than half the land is unusable, or the parties would be better served financially by a forced sale. Brock can say that by selling the land, they would be making millions, which they probably wouldn't otherwise be able to make, and it would be better off for the community as well, since condos will be put in for people to buy. In addition, Brock doesn't want to make beer anymore, so this would be a equitable way for him to make millions and find a job that he loves. Also, it would be hard to divide up the land, since there's so much of it and so much (a business) at stake. Alex: Alex will say that this should be partition in kind. Alex will say that it wouldn't be burdensome to divide up the land because it's just two people. Alex will also so that this would force him to sell his business, which he loves, because it's been his dream to make beer as he said, he is significantly both financially and emotionally invested in the property. For the last three years he has come deeply invested in this beer business. Like the Delfino court, the Alex would ask the court to consider the personality interests that he has, such as being here for three years (although Brock could say isn't a lot of time), it would hurt him financially because he would be forced to sell his business, even though he would make millions from the sale, and he is deeply connected to the land. Money isn't the only factor. The court will probably say that this partition could be a partition in kind, in which Brock could be free to sell his half of the land, and Alex could either move to business on to his half of the land or sell his. The court probably won't force the two men to sell the land, since it would be a severe disadvantage to Alex. Brock can either stay put or seek a partition. He probably won't get the full land though because it will be split up, so he might not get the full $2m. Dear Carl, Thank you for reaching out. In regard to the coins, it is likely that they will be classified as either embedded or treature trove. Some states follow treasure trove, in which you, the finder, would have the rights to the coins, unless the true finder claims them. An item is usually characterized as treasure trove when coins or currency is embedded by someone, and the person who burried them is probably dead because they've been burried for so long. Some states follow embedded, in which the owner of the property, in this case, the store would get the coins. The purpose of this rule is to stop people from trespassing. Since the coins were clearly embedded into the store, because you had to get on your hands in knees, and they were in a bag, they would probably count as treasure trove. And since you found them, you would have the right against all except the true owner. This could be an issue, since the bag is labebeld with the former grocery stores name, only ten years ago, the old grocery store could make a claim to them. Until then, you would get them. If the state follows the embedded rule, the grocery store would get them. However, if the grocery store is no longer in business, it probably wouldn't go to them. If this state follows treasure trove, you will get them, unless the grocery store claims them. If the state follows the embedded rule, the owner of the premesis will get them, good against all except true owner. In regard to the growler, you most likely have a bailment claim. A voluntary bailment exists when the bailee (the bartender) takes possession of the growler for a temporary period of time. You have a voluntary bailment here because you gave the possession to the bartender for safe keeping, until you picked it up. That is easy to establish because you, the bailor, gave the growler to the bartender, in his hand, and you received a ticket back from the, siginifiying that the bartender had your possession. In contrast to the ticket in Allen, this ticket doesn't have any instructions on it. The bar could make the argument that there was a sign saying that ""stolen items are not our fault"" but even if they did, it is likely that people might not see the sign, comparable to the court's decision in Allen. This is comparable to a coat check or a valet, where you are given a ticket when you give either your coat or car to someone to temporary safe keeping. You could have a claim against this bar, as Allen did against Hyatt Hotel, although that case involved an involuntary bailment, and this is a voluntary bailment because you hand, and you received a ticket back from the, siginifiying that the bartender had your possession. In contrast to the ticket in Allen, this ticket doesn't have any instructions on it. The bar could make the argument that there was a sign saying that ""stolen items are not our fault"" but even if they did, it is likely that people might not see the sign, comparable to the court's decision in Allen. This is comparable to a coat check or a valet, where you are given a ticket when you give either your coat or car to someone to temporary safe keeping. You could have a claim against this bar, as Allen did against Hyatt Hotel, although that case involved an involuntary bailment, and this is a voluntary bailment because you satisfied the traditional elements of delivery and control. As previously stated, you delivered the growler to the bartender, he had control over it, and he lost them. The bartender could argue that it was someone else who lost your growler, but once your possession was in the bartender's hand, it was his responsibility to keep it safe. In regard to the coat, you most likely that an involuntary bailment. An involuntary bailment is when a bailee reasonably expeced, under the circumstances, to keep your item safe (Allen). Here, you most likely have a involuntary bailment because when you placed your coat on the coat rack, you had a reasonable expectation that you would get the coat back, since the purpose of the coat rack is to hand a coat, so you can get it on your way out. You didn't say if there was a sign saying ""we are not responsible for lost items"", but if that were the case, you might not have much of a case, but since the ticket in Allen said that, and the court held that people probably don't look atthe ticket, the same can be said for a sign. A possible argument against you is that you left anyway. However, it is reasonable for someone to feel frustated when their coat is stolen. The bar could make an argument, using the dissent in Allen, that the traditional elements of control and delivery are not present with the coat. You walked in, put the coat on the rack, and then left it. You didn't give it to someone who works at the bar, you just left it in an open space. Bailments are not present in open spaces, which is what an open bar might be considered. Also, it is likely that people lose coats often, and if every person who loses a coat in a bar made a court claim, it would overflow the courts. If this is the case, you probably won't have a bailment argument for the coat. The interests: Deed to David David the developer has a deed. it takes creation when the deed is made, not at death. David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation, and Fred and Frank have an executory interest. This is not a fee The interests: Deed to David David the developer has a deed. it takes creation when the deed is made, not at death. David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation, and Fred and Frank have an executory interest. This is not a fee simple determinable because if David ever uses the land for non-residential purposes, it will go to a third party (Fred and Frank). If Frank and Fred weren't in the deed, it would go back to Alex automatically, but that is not the case. The land that goes to David will automatically go to Alex's sons, Fred and Frank, because David decided to stop making use of the land for residential purposes. RAP applies to executory interests. RAP seeks to limit dead hand control (as explained in earlier question) but RAP wouldn't be void here because David stopped using the land for residential purposes within a year after it was given to him. Although Alex could make the argument that RAP would make the condition void, since it is likely that is us unknowable whether the David would stop using the land for the intended purpose in the deed within 21 years, but that did happen. However, if the court finds that RAP would apply here, then Frank and Fred's interests would be void under RAP because it is impossible to know whether someone will violate a condition within the lifetime of the grantor + 21 years. The interests: Deed to Edward The issue is whether the grant to edward is a fee simple determinable or fee simple subject to condition subsequent followed by a power of termination. The rule, from the Marenholz case is that when a grant is given for an ambiguous purpose, and otherwise reverting back to the grantor, it is a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter in the grantor. The fee simple determinable automatically reverts back to the grantor if Edward violates the condition of selling IPAs on the property. If this were a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, followed by a power of termination, Alex would have to take steps to get the land back, it wouldn't go back automatically. The court usually grants a fee simple determinable if it's ambiguous, because most people don't know that they have to take further steps to get their land back with fee simple subject to condition subsequent. The land will automatically revert back to Alex, because it's fee simple determinable. While Edward can make the claim that there was no other way for him to make money on his property, other than to sell IPA's, the court probably wouldn't buy that argument. take steps to get the land back, it wouldn't go back automatically. The court usually grants a fee simple determinable if it's ambiguous, because most people don't know that they have to take further steps to get their land back with fee simple subject to condition subsequent.

While Edward can make the claim that there was no other way for him to make money on his property, other than to sell IPA's, the court probably wouldn't buy that argument. "," Betty: Right to exclude; waste right to exclude: The issue is whether or not Betty has the right to exclude Debbie from tresspassing on to her property for a self-serving purpose. The rule, from Jacque, is that a property owner has the right to exclude a trespasser from their land, who is there for a self-serving purpose. Betty could argue that Debbie is on her property for a self-serving purpose because she is there to use the outdoors (because she really likes being outside) and to make gardens, hunt, and allow others to hunt. Betty could argue that, like the court is Jacque, she will try to take the law into her own hands. Betty could argue that she wasn't trespassing because she was there legally, since her father conveyed the property to her upon his death. The court will probably side with Debbie because Debbie is legally on her property. Waste: The issue is whether Debbie committed waste by building a structure on the property, clearing trees, and making a garden. The rule for waste that Betty will use is from Jackson, which states that anything that causes permanent injury is waste. Here, Betty can say that by cutting down all the trees, she is hurting the future inheritance of the property. Debbie is permanently causing waste becaues the tress probably won't grow back, there is a structuture which Betty doesn't approve of, and a garden, which wasn't there before. However, Debbie could argue that Betty's claims are meritless because she never went to the property. She never even thought about it. It is unlikely that she would know how tall the trees were or if there was a garden there before Debbie entered. Debbie could also use the dissent in Jackson, stating that some waste is likely to occur and that she actually made the land more valuable (ameliorative waste). A court using this rule will likely side with Betty because Debbie did alter the state of the the land. Tenancy by Entirety: the issue is whether Andrew7can unilaterally convery interest to Chris. The rule for tenancy by entirety is that the husband and wife must both consent to a transfer of title. Here, Andrew the trees were or if there was a garden there before Debbie entered. Debbie could also use the dissent in Jackson, stating that some waste is likely to occur and that she actually made the land more valuable (ameliorative waste). A court using this rule will likely side with Betty because Debbie did alter the state of the the land. Tenancy by Entirety: the issue is whether Andrew can unilaterally convery interest to Chris. The rule for tenancy by entirety is that the husband and wife must both consent to a transfer of title. Here, Andrew unilterally conveyed the title to Chris without Betty's permission. However, Andrew could say that it was with both of their consent because he thought the title conveyance was from both of them, using a color of title argument. As long as Chris thought the title was valid, his interest will be valid, and he is given the possessory interest of the land that he cultivated. A court will probably find for chris for the amount the land he cultivated, therefore it would be fine for Debbie. Debbie: AP; Color of Title; Tacking; waste AP: the issue is whether Debbie has adverse possesion over the land that Betty thought she owned. The rule for adverse possession under Tieu is that when a claimaint believes they are possessing property that is theirs (good faith), and satisfies the elements: Actual (actually there, adversely possession); Open/Notorious (visible, putting the tenant on constructive notice) although Marengo says that the claimaint must put the true owner on actual notice that their rights are being violated and mannillo states that a minor encroachment isn't open/notorious; Exclusive: acting without true owners permission (another way to interpret this is Cahill: objective manifestations that another has a superior title is something the court takes into account when determining AP claim); continuous (without interruption) (however, circumstances may differ with summer homes and homes of that nature); Hostile (without true owners permission). Debbie will argue that the satisfies the good faith argument because she thought the land was hers, and it is, because of color of title. She will argue that she satisfies that actual portion because she was actually there, adversely possession. Betty could argue that Debbie wasn't there between 2001-2009, but Debbie can tack on the years because she was in privity with Chris (her father). Debbie will argue that it is open and notorious because she made a structure, made a garden, and cut down trees. However, Betty could argue that is wasn't open and notorious because she never ventures beyond the two acres around her house. But, given that Betty did own this property at one point, she would've been expected to visit it and know the land. Debbie will argue that her use was exclusive because like an owner, she is building a house on the property and lives there full time. However, Betty can argue that no reasonable person would 9 let hunters roam free in their land, hunting whenever they want. Debbie could argue that this is what her dad did when he owned the property by color of title, so she is just continuing to do the same. Debbie will argue that she is there continuously and cut down trees. However, Betty could argue that is wasn't open and notorious because she never ventures beyond the two acres around her house. But, given that Betty did own this property at one point, she would've been expected to visit it and know the land.

Debbie could argue that this is what her dad did when he owned the property by color of title, so she is just continuing to do the same. Debbie will argue that she is there continuously because she built a home there year round. But, Betty could argue that she hasn't been there continuously since 2001. But, since tacking is allowed here, taking on the number of years is fine in this situation. Debbie will argue that she satisfies the hostile element, because she is there without the true owners permission because she is there without Betty's permission. In addition, Debbies time there will satisfy the SoL because she is there for +10 years with the tacking. Although this is a close call, due to the exclusive and open/notorious elements, the court will likely rule in favor of Debbie. Waste: The issue is whether building the house, clearing down trees, and making a garden is considered waste. Debbie will probably use the Wood rule: Ameliorative waste, doing something to change the property, is not considered to be waste because it is improving the property. Debbie will argue that she is improving the property because she is adding a house, that could be sold, adding a garden, from which she can probably sell the food she is growing, and clearing some trees is inevitable, as owners usually do that on large properties. Betty could argue that these three things don't add value because no one will want to buy the land that is a free for all for hunting. However, the court will probably rule that, under the Wood rule, this is Ameliorative waste. ",230,2216,1270
66628068-95d2-4527-b20a-5f64f5532b25," Before analyzing the grant through the RAP, the present & furture intrests are as follows: As he is currenlty alive and has simply created a grant and NOT a conveyence, Oliver has a present posessory fee simple in his property. The next part of the grant ""to the first of my children to retire, for life"" gives a contingent remiander in a life estate to the first child to retire and nothing to the child who retires second, whether that be Connor or Carla. The next part of the grant ""then to my nephew Robert for life"", gives a contingent remainder in a life estate to Robert. The final part of the grant ""then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25"", this gives Victor, who is 26 at the time of the grant a vested remainder in fee simple subject to partial divestment and Vivian a contingent remiander in fee simple. The rule agasint perpetuities mandates that an intrest must vest or fail within 21 years of any life in being at the time of the conveyence/deed. Given that all parties are alive at the time of the grant, they are all their own vaildating lives in being and none of the intrestes are void under the rule againt perputities. 2) "," A. The first issue that will need resolved is that of the nature of this property interest. From the grant, it is clear that this is a tenants in common, despite the fact that the word ""jointly"" is included. It is unlikley that a court would recognize that a JTWROS had been created. This is becuase not only do courts tend to favor tenants in common in the event of ambigous langauge, but especially as not all 4 elements of the 4 unites, posession, interest, time, title are satisfed as you and Alex came into the property at different times, the court is extremely unlikely to rule this to be a JTWROS, So, the nature of your property is a 1/2 interest is a tenancy in common with your brother. The next issue is that of what can be done about the interest of the developer. The first way to resolve this issue is to simply sell your 1/2 interest to the property developer. As a tenant in common, you are able to unilaterly convey your interest at any time. However, it is unclear if the developer is interested in obtaining only one half of the property. the property at different times, the court is extremely unlikely to rule this to be a JTWROS, So, the nature of your property is a 1/2 interest is a tenancy in common with your brother. The next issue is that of what can be done about the interest of the developer. The first way to resolve this issue is to simply sell your 1/2 interest to the property developer. As a tenant in common, you are able to unilaterly convey your interest at any time. However, it is unclear if the developer is interested in obtaining only one half of the property. The next possible resoultion is a partion action with your brother. A partition is when concurent tenants have a court divide up the property either physically in a partiton in kind or by selling the enitre property in a partion by sale. Courts often favor a partion in kind as forcing a sale of property agasint the wishes of an owner is something courts try to do as sparingly as possible. However, the court will liekly find persuasive that you will likely be prejudiced by a partion in kind, as it is unclear if the developer is even interested in 1/ the property in the first place. If a partion in kind action were to occur, it is clear that the side with the brewery would be more valuable, making it more difficult to for the court to physically partion the property. However, if this issue should arise, whomever recives the more valuble piece of land will be able to pay ""owelty"" to the other, so as to negate the discrepency in value. The next option is a partion by sale. Here, it is clear that you and Alex will both see material benefit as the property is much more valuable and desirable to the real estate developer as a whole unit. However, when considering a partion by sale, the courts find a number of things persuasive beyond the interests of one party and monetary gain. Your brother Alex's is likely to invoke his strong sentimental attachment to the property, he had long dreamed of creating this brewery and built it up into the sucessful business it is today. He is also likely to point to the fact that a local brewery with a tasting room and a resutrant serves a great benefit to society. Ultimatley, conisdering all these facts, it is unlikely that the court will force a partion by sale as the intrests of both Alex and society at large outweight your interest of maxamizing your profits on the sale. Your best chance is then a partion in kind. B. The first issue to resolve are the coins found. While you may try to invoke an argument found Wenner, where men hired to pave a driveway and found valuble coins and argued that the coins should be classified as treasure trove, which is property Your best chance is then a partion in kind. B. The first issue to resolve are the coins found. While you may try to invoke an argument found Wenner, where men hired to pave a driveway and found valuble coins and argued that the coins should be classified as treasure trove, which is property that has been intentionally placed somewhere and the owners are either dead or unascertainable, making the finders are the true owners they were ultiamtley unsucessful in their argument. While this is partially persuasive, given how old the coins were, they are not liekly to side with you given that these coins were seemingly placed there no more than 10 years ago. The owners of the brewery are likely to argue that the facts at present are more analgous to that of the barbershop case, where a man put his wallet on a counter and walked out, and the court held that the wallet was mislaid property, meaning that it was the rightful property of the as against everyone but the true owner. They will argue that the coins were clealry wrapped up neatly and placed somewhere intetionally and that due to the fact that the wrapping is at most 10 years old the owner is ascertainable. Given that these coins were neatly placed and labeled and the owner is likely alive and ascertainable, it is unlikley that the court will find that they are treasure trove and instead find them to be mislaid proeprty meaning that you have no legal right to the coins and they are the property of the brewery's owner good agaisnt eveyone but the true owner. As to the growler and jacket, you may attempt to argue that a bailment was created when you put your coat on the rack and when you recieved a claim ticket for the growler. A bailment is when an item in the temporary care and duty of another is destroyed/lost/stolen/damaged etc. You may invoke the holding in Hyatt regency, where plaintiff's car was stolen out of the defednants parking garage. In Hyatt, the man recieved a claim ticket for his car and there was a clear expectaion of duty and care, evidenced by the security guards present as well as the gates at each exit. It is persuasive that the growler fit this description, given that a claim ticket was taken for it and a clear duty of care was assumed. However, the brewery is likely to have a more persuasive argument concering the loss of the coat. The brewery will have very little vaild rebuttal to as to the agrument concerning the growler given the circumstances. However, as to the coat, the brewery will argue that no increased expectation of care can parking garage. In Hyatt, the man recieved a claim ticket for his car and there was a clear expectaion of duty and care, evidenced by the security guards present as well as the gates at each exit. It is persuasive that the growler fit this description, given that a claim ticket was taken for it and a clear duty of care was assumed. However, the brewery is likely to have a more persuasive argument concering the loss of the coat. The brewery will have very little vaild rebuttal to as to the agrument concerning the growler given the circumstances. However, as to the coat, the brewery will argue that no increased expectation of care can be assumed simply by putting ones coat on a communal rack. No ticket was ever given nor was there any expressed/expected guarentee of care for the coats on the rack. As to the coat, the court is unlikely to find that any bailment was created as no agreement of duty or care was agreed to at any point in time and they are unlikely to rule in your favor there. However, as to the growler, the court is likely to find and rule that a bailment was created and find in your favor. C. The first conveyence to David, before the RAP is applied gives David a Fee simple subject to executory limitation and your sons frank and fred have executory intrests. According to the RAP, an intrest must vest or fail within 21 years of any life in being at the time of the conveyence/deed. THis is to limit dead hand control on a piece of property which could diminish its value/usefulness long into the future. Applying the RAP, the conveyence to Fred and Frank is void. This is because it could be used for residental purposes for 500 years, and obviously no life in being plus 21 years at the time of the conveyence will be alive and thus the interest is void. It is not revelant that it did, just that it COULD. Thus, David owns the property in a fee simple absloute. The RAP will not apply to the conveyence to Edward given that there is a reversionary interest in the grantor and it need not be discussed. The language of the conveyence to Edward indicates that he has been given a Fee simple subject to condition subsequent, which is widely preferred by courts so that one isnt as apt to losing their property, and you have maintaiend a right of re entry. It is clear that the condition that no IPA's be brewed on the land has been violated and you may reclaim his property. Ultimatley, you will have no right to the parcel of land conveyed to David, but as the conditions were violated on the conveyence to Edward he has right of re-entry, which you must take affirmative action to recover. "," The issue before us is who has legal title to Greenacre. Debbie is likely to agrue that she has gained the title to Greenacre via adverse posession. She will liekly look to such cases as Morgan or Piemntioal for precedent. In order to to obtain a piece of property by adverse posession, one must satisfy ALL the following elements or fail; open & notorious, continous, exclusive, actual and hostile as well as satsfying the statutory peroid, which varies by jurisdiction. The stautory peroid here is 10 years. The first issue to adress is the fact that Debbie (D) had been living on the property since 2009, while this would satsify the time statute on its own, given that she was transferred the property volunitraly, she is able to ""tack"" on Chris' time spent on the property. The next element she will need to satsify is ""open and notorious"". The fact that there is a cabin, which Chris had expanded, where debbie planted a garden and which neigbors were aware of is surely enough to put on notice any owner who cared to come to their property and look. The next element is ""continous"". While it may be argued that Chris' use was not continous given that he only spent 8 weeks and then some weeks fishing and Debbie only just recentley made it her permentant home, one need not spend 24/7 year round on the property to satsify this element, one only must use it so often as is reaosnable. Given that this was cabin in the woods, the time spent by both of them throughout the years is undoubtedly reaosnable enough to satsifty the requiremnts of this element. The next is ""exclusive"". While it may be argued that the use of the area by neighbors defeats the exclusivity claim, those using the land with permission are allowed on the property and do not destory exclusivity. The next element is ""actual"". This was clear actual use both debbie and chris used the property regularly. They did not simply drive by every now and again, but insted built and improved the land. The last element to satsify is ""hostile"". The use of the land must be hostile to the true owner and it is clear that in this instance it was. After the conveyence, neither becky nor andrew were allowed on the property and neither made any attempt to remove Chris or Debbie. (some Finally, while it is not relevant in most jurisdictions jurisdctions require good faith, where maine requires bad faith) it is clear that both debbie & chris were acting in good faith, believing that they owned the land outright and had no idea about the fradulent conveyence. debbie and chris used the property regularly.

Given that Betty would not be able to defeat any of the elements of adverse posession, she will likely try to claim that Debbie is only entitled to the immidete area in which she was using and the remainder is still in her posession. However, given that Chris came into the property via a color of title, fraudlent or not, this argument will fail and entitle Debbie to the whole of the property. Ultimatley, the court will find that Debby satsfied all the elemens including the statutory peroid and is entiteled the enterity of Greenacre by adverese poesssion. ",213,1625,669
e0f7847f-6289-4c40-8302-6b3d057cad4e," Prior to RAP, O has an exexutory interest in fee simple that will be cut short when/if Carla or Connor retires and their interest in life estate becomes possessory. Oliver's children Connor and Carla have contingent remainders in life estate (they are not alternate because neither could meet the condition of retiring if both work their wholes lives until death. Even though the people are known/ascertained Carla and Conor must meet the condition of retiring first to get O's property for life. Robert has a vested remainder in life estate, it is vested because Robert is alive at the time of the grant and there are no conditions he must satisfy before he gets the life estate. He must patiently wait since he has a vested remainder interest (in life estate). Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple. Victor is alive at the time of the grant and has also satisfied the condition of turing 25. The vested remainder is subject to open because Carla and/or Conor (O's kids) could have more kids which would expand the class of grandchildren such that Victor would have to share his vested interest in fee simple. Vivian has a contingent remainder in fee simple. Although she is alive/known at the time of the grant she still has to meet the condition of turning 25 for the interest to vest. Lastly O, (or when O dies, O's estate) has a reversion in fee simple, in the event that his grandchildren all die before they reach 25 and thus their interest never becomes possessory. After applying RAP, we only consider contingent remainders, vested remainders subject to open, and executory interests (none in this example). Carla and Connor have contingent remainders subject to RAP. They are alive at the time of the grant so they are lives in being. Carla serves as her validating life and Connor serves as his validating life and during their respective lives, the interest will either vest or fail (either they will retire or they won't) so their interests are valid under RAP. Similarly, Robert's interest is a contingent remainder and he is alive at the time of the grant and so he can serve as his own validating life and when his interest is ready to become possessory he will either be alive to receive it (it will vest) or it will fail, so his interest is valid under RAP. Victor's interest in a vested remainder subject to open is subject to RAP and also valid since the rule of convenience applies. The rule of convenience tells us that because Victor is alive and has satisfied the condition (of turning 25) his interest becomes a and Connor serves as his validating life and during their respective lives, the interest will either vest or fail (either they will retire or they won't) so their interests are valid under RAP. Similarly, Robert's interest is a contingent remainder and he is alive at the time of the grant and so he can serve as his own validating life and when his interest is ready to become possessory he will either be alive to receive it (it will vest) or it will fail, so his interest is valid under RAP. Victor's interest in a vested remainder subject to open is subject to RAP and also valid since the rule of convenience applies. The rule of convenience tells us that because Victor is alive and has satisfied the condition (of turning 25) his interest becomes a vested remainder. The rule of convenience closes the class such that only the grandchildren that are alive at the time of the grant (Victor and Vivian) are eligible to receive the interest, the interest will not apply to any afterborn grandchildren. Vivian has a contingent remainder in fee simple and her interest is subject to RAP and valid. She is alive at the time of the grant and can serve as her own life in being. Within her lifetime we will know whether she reached 25 or not, and thus whether the interest will vest or fail. "," 1a. Dear Brock, There are several issues we should discuss with regards to your property interests in the warehouse and your possible options. We must first determine what concurrent property interest you share with Alex. The first issue is whether the deed signed by your brother Alex conveys a tenancy in common or a joint tenancy. The language is not clear and specific enough to convey a joint tenancy as there is no explicit langage indicating a right of survorship, the unique characteristic of a joint tenancy. When deeds such as these have ambigious langauge the court will likley default to a tenancy in common. In a tenancy in common, each co-tenant has a fractional interest in the undivided, whole property. This means each co- tenant has a fractional interest as it pertains to the carrying charges they must pay (mortgage, taxes, utitlies to maintain the property), to share, according to their fractional interest, any rent generated by third parties and any accounting fees. The ""undivided, whole"" langauge means that you have a right to use the whole property, have the right to exclude third parties (if one party wants a third party on the property, and the other co-tenant doesn't, the co-tenant who doesn't will likley prevail, unless there's a limit to the right to exclude such as in Shack where Shack never had the right to exclude government workers providing medical and legal aid to the migrants on his property. In addition, in a tenancy in tenant has a fractional interest as it pertains to the carrying charges they must pay (mortgage, taxes, utitlies to maintain the property), to share, according to their fractional interest, any rent generated by third parties and any accounting fees. The ""undivided, whole"" langauge means that you have a right to use the whole property, have the right to exclude third parties (if one party wants a third party on the property, and the other co-tenant doesn't, the co-tenant who doesn't will likley prevail, unless there's a limit to the right to exclude such as in Shack where Shack never had the right to exclude government workers providing medical and legal aid to the migrants on his property. In addition, in a tenancy in common, neither co-tenant can charge the other rent (Martin v. Martin) unless there is a specific agreement to do so. When Alex yelled at you to leave and never come back, this might, coupled with other evidence such as if Alex changed the locks to the warehouse and brewery, suggest ouster (where one co-tenant forcibly excludes the other, such that the ousting tenant must pay rent to the ousted tenant for the period during which they are ousted). However, without further evidence, if you chose so leave the warehouse and brewery voluntarily, you would not be ousted and not able to collect rent. The one exception to this would be if you left voluntarily, and Alex was the only one using the warehouse and brewery and paying all of the carrying charges, Alex would file an action for accounting to get you to pay your 50% of the carrying charges. While you might have to pay these, you could argue that Alex could have rented your 50% interest and recovered rent generated by third parties. This possible third- party generated rent could be used to offset your 50% share in carrying charges that Alex is requesting. Unlike in Martin v. Martin, where the tenants in common had different fractional interests in the undividied whole, the deed indicates that you and Alex each have a 50% interest. In addition, as a tenant in common, you (and Alex) must pay carrying charges but in contrast, if Alex decided to make improvements to the brewery or to the warehouse, you would not be responsible unless such improvements were neccesary to the maintenance of either. Either you or Alex has the right to unilaterally transfer/convey your 50% interest by inter vivos transfer or in a will. However, if the court did find that the deed conveyed a joint tenancy, you and Alex would have equal interests in the undivided, whole property. Joint tenancy is similar to tenants in common but has a right to surviorship and four unities. The right of survivorship indicates that when one joint tenant dies, their interest in the property dies and thus the other joint tenant receives the deceased's interest. This eliminates a need for a will and a will will not sever joint tenancy. A joint tenancy also must have the four unities: the interest must be conveyed to the joint tenants at the same time, conveyed in the same title (document or if they jointly acquire it through adverse possession), an equal and undivided interest in the whole, and an equal right to posessess the whole. Unlike tenants in common, in a joint tenancy, transfer of your share of the property during your life will sever the joint tenancy and Alex and the new co-tenant would become tenants in common, eliminating the right of surviorship. Traditionally in interest in the property dies and thus the other joint tenant receives the deceased's interest. This eliminates a need for a will and a will will not sever joint tenancy. A joint tenancy also must have the four unities: the interest must be conveyed to the joint tenants at the same time, conveyed in the same title (document or if they jointly acquire it through adverse possession), an equal and undivided interest in the whole, and an equal right to posessess the whole. Unlike tenants in common, in a joint tenancy, transfer of your share of the property during your life will sever the joint tenancy and Alex and the new co-tenant would become tenants in common, eliminating the right of surviorship. Traditionally in common law a third party straw man was required to convey a joint tenancy but today either you or Alex could unilaterally sever it. Moreover, depending if you were in a lien theory or title theopry jurisdiction, a mortage would affect severence. In a lien theory jurisdiction, like in Harms v Sprauge, a mortage will not sever joint tenancy. Most jurisidicitons have adopted this theory. However, in a minority of states, a mortage will sever joint tenancy. I will need to do some more research to advise you on this issue. Given that the language in the grant doesn't explicitly indicate a right of survivorship, you and Alex are likley tenants in common and each have a right to freely transfer your interest in the property. Given that you are interested in profitting from selling the warehouse and 10 acres of land to the developer, your best option would be a partition (division) of the property. Assuming you have a tenancy in common, there are two options: a partition in kind and a partition by sale, both of which were discussed in Delfino v. Velanceis . A partition in kind is when the property is physically divided based on each co-tenant's fractional interest. Courts have a preference for partition in kind doctrinally but practically it's difficult for the courts to ascertain value (for example, if your shares with Alex were not 50/50 but were 1/3 you and 2/3 Alex, your 1/3 physically fractional of the property could be more valuable than his 2/3. The court could order you to pay owelty payments to Alex to account for such a difference). A partition in sale is when the property is sold at market value and each co-tenant receives their fractional share from the proceeds. A court will generally only resort to a partition by sale when 1. it will promote the best interests of all the co-tenants, 2. partition in kind is physically impractical such that doing so would mean someone didn't have access to a road or they couldn't physically divide building into respective shares and 3. parition in kind would result in tiny pieces of land, where there are many co-tenants (such Native American's who have tiny fractional interests in national Indian reserves). Even though a partition by sale would result in more money, the court will also show sympathy for not kicking Alex off land where the warehouse is sold, like in Delfino v. Velancis where Delfino wanted a partition by sale because it could generate more money, Velancis lived and had her waste business on the property and had lived there for many years. Courts don't want to kick people off their land if they that doing so would mean someone didn't have access to a road or they couldn't physically divide building into respective shares and 3. parition in kind would result in tiny pieces of land, where there are many co-tenants (such Native American's who have tiny fractional interests in national Indian reserves). Even though a partition by sale would result in more money, the court will also show sympathy for not kicking Alex off land where the warehouse is sold, like in Delfino v. Velancis where Delfino wanted a partition by sale because it could generate more money, Velancis lived and had her waste business on the property and had lived there for many years. Courts don't want to kick people off their land if they don't have to. Like in Delfino, the court will likely determine that it should grant a partition in kind because a partition by sale is not in the best interest of all parties (you and Alex- who has an emotional interest in the property and doesn't want to leave), there is no indication that it would be physically impractical to divide the property into two shares, and because only you and Alex have interests in the 10 acres and warehouse, a partition in kind would not result in tiny, impractial lots. 1b Dear Carl, I am writing to advise you on your property rights with regards to the found coins, and if you can take any legal action to recover the growler and your coat. The first issue is what type of found property the gold coins are. There are 5 possible categories of found property: lost property, mislaid property, abandoned, treasure trove, and in some jurisdictions embedded property. In addition to these categories, the court will also consider the intent of the finder (good faith v bath faith), the location where the property was found, what condition it was is, the value of the found property, and if there is any societal benefit to it. Unlike in Armory v. Delmarie where a boy found a jewel while cleaning the sidewalk, the gold coins you found were tucked away in a hole, suggesting that the owner did not uninterntionally and involuntarly part with the property. If the coins were considered lost property, as the finder you would have a right to them against the world except the truw owner. The coins could possibly be mislaid, where the truw owner voluntarily leaves their property buyt then forgets where they left it. The finder doesn't get the property, but rather the owner of the location where the property was found gets to keep it. Unlike in McAvoy v Medina, where a purse was voluntarily left in plain sign on the barber's counter but then the owner of the purse forgot about it, here the coins are not visible as they were in the ground and you merely stumbled across them when your phone dropped. If the coins were mislaid, they would belong to the owner of the brewery (where they were found) and so you and Alex would get them. The policy rationale is that if someone misplaces truw owner. The coins could possibly be mislaid, where the truw owner voluntarily leaves their property buyt then forgets where they left it. The finder doesn't get the property, but rather the owner of the location where the property was found gets to keep it. Unlike in McAvoy v Medina, where a purse was voluntarily left in plain sign on the barber's counter but then the owner of the purse forgot about it, here the coins are not visible as they were in the ground and you merely stumbled across them when your phone dropped. If the coins were mislaid, they would belong to the owner of the brewery (where they were found) and so you and Alex would get them. The policy rationale is that if someone misplaces their property they are likley to retrace their steps to find it. The property could be abandoned, where the owner voluntarily and intentionally parts with the property and the finder has a right to it against the whole world. Perhaps a criminal stole the coins and they were sold on the black market for years and only were recently hidden in the grocery bag. If they were mislaid, you as the finder would get to keep them. The coins are most likley treasure trove or embedded property. Treasure trove is property that is so old and/or ancient artifacts that the true owner is likley dead and the finder has a right to the property against the whole world. Here the coins are from the 1800's so you could argue that the true owner is probably dead (if the court ignores the argument that they were a hobbiest's collectable coins). This is likley your best argument as to why you should get possession of the gold coins. However, if you are in a jurisdiciton that allows for embedded property, like in Corliss v Wenner where coins were in the owner's driveway and the owner got to keep them even though she didn't find them , then the the property will go to the owners of the location of where the coins were found. If this is the case, both you and Alex have 50% interest in the coins. The policy rationale for embedded property is to discourage tresspassers from going on other people's land to get valuables that might be hidden. Here, you came across the property not as a thief but with good intentions. The coins were hidden and somewhat presevered and are valuable because they are worth 20,000 dollars. Depending on what jurisdiction you are int he court will likley determine that you have property rights in the coins (in treasure trove jurisdicitons) or 50% property interests (if in embedded jurisdiciton). The next issue is the who should be liable for the loss of the growler and your coat. The growler was entrusted property that you gave to the bartender, which created a bailment relationship similar to car valets, dry cleaners, or parking garages. As the bailor you voluntarily gave the bartender thr right to temporarily possess the growler. The bartender, as the bailee, was entrusted with the growler to fill it with beer and return it in the same state he received it. Simialr to Allen v Hyatt Hotel, you received a claim ticket, similar to the parking garage ticket Allen received. You gave the growler to the bartender which signified that the bartender was to fill it with beer and return it to you. Unlike in Allen v. Hyatt, where the man parked in a closed parking garage (one exit) that was monitored by the hotel, here the bar might have more than one exit such that the growler is not in a secured place. The bartender could argue valets, dry cleaners, or parking garages. As the bailor you voluntarily gave the bartender thr right to temporarily possess the growler. The bartender, as the bailee, was entrusted with the growler to fill it with beer and return it in the same state he received it. Simialr to Allen v Hyatt Hotel, you received a claim ticket, similar to the parking garage ticket Allen received. You gave the growler to the bartender which signified that the bartender was to fill it with beer and return it to you. Unlike in Allen v. Hyatt, where the man parked in a closed parking garage (one exit) that was monitored by the hotel, here the bar might have more than one exit such that the growler is not in a secured place. The bartender could argue that customer could have taken the growler, there are likley many people coming in and out of the bar so it's not being closely monitored by one person so he did not fail to exercise due care. However, you could argue that the ticket, similar to a dry clearners ticket when you drop off clothes or a ticket you receive when you park in a garage, even if its not monitored, likley creates a bailment relationship. Unlike in finders law, the bailee and the bailor cannot both recover from the lost growler. If you bring an action against the bartender then you have to show that he failed to exercise due care and a presumption of negligence will arise that the bartender must rebut. Given that the ticket alone likley creates a bailment relationship, you should bring an action against the bartender to recover for damages. In contrast to your growler, with your coat there is no bailment relationship. You may have left it in the bar and another patron may have mistakenly taken it but there is no bailment relationshio between you and the bar. You didn't receive a ticket from leaving your coat on an open hook and thus did not temporarily entrust your property with the bar. 1c. Alex creates two deeds. In the first one: David has a fee simple subject to executory limiation and Frank and Fred have a shared executory interest in fee simple. If David doesn't use the property for residental purposes, his interest will disapear and Fred and Frank's interest become possessory. Alex has no interest in the property. When David violates his interest in 2017 by using the property for residential and non-residential purposes, Alex would argue that David violated the condition and that his interest should end and Frank and Fred should take present possession of the property. David would likley try to argue that he is still using some of the peoperty for residential purposes or that the commercial spaces will enhance residential purposes so he should continue to have posession of the peoperty. In the second deed with the brewery: the language has words of duration ""so long as"" which would make Edward have a fee simple determinable, and8 Alex would have a possibility of reverter. If Edward started making IPA's, Alex's interest would become immediately possessory (in contrast if the grant was a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and Alex had a right of entry he would have to file an should end and Frank and Fred should take present possession of the property. David would likley try to argue that he is still using some of the peoperty for residential purposes or that the commercial spaces will enhance residential purposes so he should continue to have posession of the peoperty. In the second deed with the brewery: the language has words of duration ""so long as"" which would make Edward have a fee simple determinable, and Alex would have a possibility of reverter. If Edward started making IPA's, Alex's interest would become immediately possessory (in contrast if the grant was a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and Alex had a right of entry he would have to file an action to remove Edward from the property). Alex would claim that because Edward started making IPA's his interest should end and Alex should immediately get present possession of the property. "," As tenants in the entirety, similar to joint tenancy there is a right of survivorship, the four unities (as mentioned earlier) plus the couple must be married at the time of conveyance. Unilateral transfer of a tenant in the entirety's interest as discussed in US v Craft, is possible through agreement of both parties, death, or divorce. Betty and Andrew did not agree to sell Greenacre, nor did they ever divorce, so when Andrew died, through a right of survivorship, Betty will argue that the property should go to her. Debbie will argue that Greenacre is hers through adverse possession or a color of title. With adverse posession, Debbie will need to have used the property for the statute of limitations period (10 years in most jurisdicitons, though perhaps Debbie can make a tacking arguement, that she obtained the property through a voluntary transfer of sale so there was privity between her and Chris), that her use was continuous, hostile and under a claim of right, actual, open and notorious, and exclusive. Debbie will argue her use was continuous because she lived in a cabin on Greenacre for the past 8 years. Her use was hostile and under a claim of right because she never asked Debbie for permission to use Greenacre. Most jurisdictions won't care what Debbie's intent was (objective intent), but other jurisdictions like Maine will require bad faith (you knew the property wasn't yours) and other jurisdictions will require good faith (you mistakenly thought the property was yours). Unlike in Cahoill v Morrow, Debbie doesn't ask Betty is she can buy the property, which would defeat the hostile element becuase she rightly thinks it is hers. Her use of the property is actual and like a true owner would use it, similar to how Ansrew used it because he also had a cabin on the property. Debbie will also claim her use was open and notorious because she visibly was on the land, such that if Debbie had come to Greenacre to check on the property it would have put her on notice. Unlike in Ross v Margengo Cave, where the cave extended below Ross's property and the opening to the cave was not on his property, he had no way of knowing that the cave was part of his property because it was subsurface. Unlike in Manillo v doesn't ask Betty is she can buy the property, which would defeat the hostile element becuase she rightly thinks it is hers. Her use of the property is actual and like a true owner would use it, similar to how Ansrew used it because he also had a cabin on the property. Debbie will also claim her use was open and notorious because she visibly was on the land, such that if Debbie had come to Greenacre to check on the property it would have put her on notice. Unlike in Ross v Margengo Cave, where the cave extended below Ross's property and the opening to the cave was not on his property, he had no way of knowing that the cave was part of his property because it was subsurface. Unlike in Manillo v Gorksi, Debbie's use is significant enough such that it satifies the open and notoriious element, and actual notice is not needed. Constructive notice is sufficient. Lastly, Debbie will claim her use of the property is exclusive, she doesn't allow strangers on it because they must ask her for permission and treats it as if a true owner would. Betty would argue that Debbie has not satisfied all of the elements of adverse posession and thus her claim to Greenacre fails. Betty could argue that Debbie has not satified the statute of limitations (if it was 10 years) because even though she obtainted the property from Chris in 2009 she has only lived on the property for 8 years. Debbie could also rebut a tacking argument because the prior owner of Greenacre, Chris, knew that Greenacre belonged to Andrew and so until in Tieu v Morgan, where Morgan used the strip of land for a period of years but didn't herself meet the SOL period, she was able to tack on the prior owner's use of the disputed strip because they were in privity and both used the stip in a way that satisfied all of the adverse possession elements. Betty likley doesn't have a good argument to defeat the hostile element since Debbie never asked her for permission. For the actual element, Betty could claim that Debbie was using it as a primary residence whereas Andrew and Chris's use of the property were more seasonal. Betty likley doesn't have a good argument to why Debbie's use is not open and notorious given that she has never come to visit the property. She could try to claim that she was never aware that her and Andrew even owned Greenacre, but the court would likley not buy this argument as it is Betty's responsibility to know what her assets are. Betty also likley doesn't have a good claim to why Debbie's use isn't exclusive because Debbie's neighbors ask for permission to use the property, suggesting Debbie has a superior right to it (as an adverse possessor) relative to her neighbors. If her claim to Greenacre via adverse possession fails, Debbie will likley try to argue that the deed was defective and try to get the property through color of title. Color of title is when in good faith, a buyer of property obtains a defective deed. Under a color title, Debbie will claim that she should get all of Greenacre. Although Greenacre was given to Debbie as a gift from Chris, she could use the reasoning from Kotis v. Nowlin to argue that she obtained the property in good faith and was not trying to If her claim to Greenacre via adverse possession fails, Debbie will likley try to argue that the deed was defective and try to get the property through color of title. Color of title is when in good faith, a buyer of property obtains a defective deed. Under a color of title, Debbie will claim that she should get all of Greenacre. Although Greenacre was given to Debbie as a gift from Chris, she could use the reasoning from Kotis v. Nowlin to argue that she obtained the property in good faith and was not trying to tresspass on Betty's property intentionally. However, in constrast to Kotis v Nowlin, Debbie never actually purchased the property. Even though Chris had a voidable title, and if someone has voidable title they can tranfer/sell the property to a good faith purchaser, Debbie received Greenacre either through a will, as an issue of Chris. Betty's counterargument to Debbie's color of title claim will be that Debbie should only be entitled to the portion of Greenacre that she's living on/uses (the 2 acres) because Betty has actual title to Greenacre. Even though Betty wasn't living on Greenacre her title to the property would be superior to Debbie's defective title. Courts will weigh the property rights relative to the parties (like in INS v AP) and will likley determine that even if Debbie has satisifed the requirements for adverse possession, all she can get from Greenacre is the 2 acres because Betty has actual title and a superior claim. Without color of title and without satisfying the elements of adverse possession, Debbie would get none of Greenacre. ",682,3252,1240
59d5ac86-6211-4549-b8e0-0c787be4707a," Oliver's children, Connor and Carla, each have a future interest in life estate subject to condition precedent because they have to meet a condition before one of them can take possession. Robert has a future interest, remainder in life estate, because he gets whatever is left over after the natural end of either Connor or Carla's life, whoever retires first. Victor has a future possessory interest, remainder in fee simple absolute subject to partial divestment because he has already met the 25 year age requirement. Because Vivian can turn 25 and also take possession of the interest, she has a future interest in fee simple subject to condition precedent. Any future, unborn grandchildren can't take the interest from Victor and Vivian because the interest already vested when Victor turned 25, before they were born. "," Brock shares tenancy in common with his brother Alex and wants to make money off the sale of the property, despite his brother's objections. Because they are tenants in common who own fractional, and in this case equal, shares of the land, it is possible that Brock could earn money on his interest by petitioning for partition by sale, in which case the land would be sold and Brock could take his 50% share of the proceeds from the sale. However, Brock could run into issues if he were to request partition by sale. It is quite likely that Alex will object to the partition by sale. If he were to in response request partition in kind, Brock could potentially lose money when the property is divided. In Delfino v. Vealencis, the Delfinos shared a lot with Vealencis in unequal shares as tenants in common. Vealencis ran a trash business from her home, and the Delfinos wanted the land partitioned, and partitioned for partition by sale. Vealencis requested partition in kind because she wanted to keep operating her business. Eventually, the court held that partition in kind was reasonable, and furthermore that when partition in kind is possible and not very inequitable, it is preferred over partition by sale. The facts of Brock's case are similar in that he and his brother are cotenants, one party requests partition by sale, the other party objects, and there is a business operated 7 the property. Because the two brothers own on equal shares of a 10 acre lot, it would be reasonably simple to divide the property into two equal pieces if Alex were to respond to Brock's request for partition by sale with a petition for partition in kind. partition by sale. Vealencis requested partition in kind because she wanted to keep operating her business. Eventually, the court held that partition in kind was reasonable, and furthermore that when partition in kind is possible and not very inequitable, it is preferred over partition by sale. The facts of Brock's case are similar in that he and his brother are cotenants, one party requests partition by sale, the other party objects, and there is a business operated on the property. Because the two brothers own equal shares of a 10 acre lot, it would be reasonably simple to divide the property into two equal pieces if Alex were to respond to Brock's request for partition by sale with a petition for partition in kind. Brock would be free to sell his own property to a developer as he wished, but he runs the risk of getting a lesser share than exactly 50%, because exact proportions are difficult to meet, losing some of the interest he has a cotenant, or he could be ordered to pay an owelty to Alex if Brock's portion of the divided land is percieved to be more valuable than Alex's even if in a literal sense it is not, as is what happened in Delfino. If Brock were to petition for partition by sale, applying the rule in Delfino, it is likely that a court will order partition in kind if Alex were to petition for it because dividing a 10 acre piece of land in two even shares is reasonably easy to do. As a tenant in common, Brock also has the right to use his share of the property and rent it to the developer for money. However, if he were to do this, he would likely be ordered by a court to split his earnings from doing so with Alex. In Martin v. Martin, the court held that tenants in common do not owe rent to each other, but they do owe profits earned from rent of a property to the other cotenants after the parties disputed over mobile homes being rented on a property owned by tenants in common. Dear Mr. Cask, As to the issue of the gold coins you found and wish to keep, it is unlikely that a court will allow you to keep the coins. It might be presumed from where the coins were found that they were mislaid, put there by someone intentionally and later forgotten or overlooked. Compared to the facts of Benjamin, where about $18,000 was carefully wrapped and placed in the wall of an airplane, your case is quite similar. A valuable item was placed in a bag and left in the wall of the brewery. The Benjamin court ultimately held that mislaid property belongs to the owner of the premises where it was found, so long as there is not a true owner who comes forward to claim it. Furthermore, if a court were to find the coins simply lost, left behind unknowingly, the McAvoy v. Medina court held that lost property belongs to the owner of where the property was found after a barber shop patron left their purse behind. If the coins were to be deemed abandoned, however, a court would likely hold that you, as the finder, are where about $18,000 was carefully wrapped and placed in the wall of an airplane, your case is quite similar. A valuable item was placed in a bag and left in the wall of the brewery. The Benjamin court ultimately held that mislaid property belongs to the owner of the premises where it was found, so long as there is not a true owner who comes forward to claim it. Furthermore, if a court were to find the coins simply lost, left behind unknowingly, the McAvoy v. Medina court held that lost property belongs to the owner of where the property was found after a barber shop patron left their purse behind. If the coins were to be deemed abandoned, however, a court would likely hold that you, as the finder, are entitled to keep them, because an abandoning owner also abandons title, so long as no prior finder comes forward with better title. However, given the fact that the coins were in a bag, hidden behind a wall, lends itself to the conclusion that a court will likely hold that they are mislaid property, and award their possession to the owners of the brewery, Alex and Brock Apple, if the true owner cannot be identified. By leaving your growler with the bartender, it is possible that a court will hold that this , created a bailment relationship. You, as the bailor, left your property to the bartender, bailee, who owed to you a reasonable duty of care as to your property. In Allen v. Hyatt, a hotel patron left his car in a parking garage that had one entrance/exit, a ticketing system, and a lot attendant, assuming the car would be safe there. He later found that his car had been stolen from the garage. The Allen court held that bailments are created when a bailor leaves their property with a bailee and there is reasonable belief on the bailor's part that their property will be safe and protected while under the care and responsibility of the bailee. Because it is reasonable that the average person would expect that by handing a growler to a bartender and exchanging it for a claim ticket would lead to the safe return of their growler once it is filled, it is likely that a court will find that this creates a bailment relationship, making the brewery liable to you for its loss. However, other court opinions, and the dissent to Allen, have stated that bailment relationships are not created as casually as by a reasonable assumption, but rather require a more concrete agreement, like a legal contract, in order to constitute a bailment. Nonetheless, it is still likely a court would find the exchange with the bartender would create a bailment relationship, and rule for you. In terms of your missing coat, it is not likely that a court would find that leaving your coat on a hook would create a bailment. It is not a reasonable expectation that someone would be watching to ensure your coat's safety, and moreover there was no system for exchanging it, like a coat check. Additionally, because we can not prove it was stolen and you affirmatively left the bar without it, saying ""forget it,"" that your coat is abandoned property, and anyone who possesses it now or in the future will likely have better claim to it than you do, as the first finder of an abandoned item has ultimate title to it. If it were to be proved stolen, you would be able to reclaim it as its rightful owner according to the court's ruling In terms of your missing coat, it is not likely that a court would find that leaving your coat on a hook would create a bailment. It is not a reasonable expectation that someone would be watching to ensure your coat's safety, and moreover there was no system for exchanging it, like a coat check.

If it were to be proved stolen, you would be able to reclaim it as its rightful owner according to the court's ruling in Kotis v. Nowlin Jewelry that said a thief has no claim over property except over other, subsequent thieves. Alex conveyed five acres of the property ""to David, so long as the property is used for residential purposes only, if it is ever used for non-residential purposes, then to my two sons, Frank and Fred."" David has a present possessory interest in fee simple subject to executory limitation. His right in fee simple is defeasible, because he can be divested by Alex's sons if a certain condition ever occurs, in this case, the use of the land for commercial purposes. Fred and Frank share executory interests in fee simple, because their interest follows David's fee simple. If David were to actually execute his plan of building non-residential space, his interest in the property would be divested by Frank and Fred, who would now own the property as joint tenants, because their possession meets the four unities, in fee simple absolute. These effects automatically take effect when a condition is broken, When Alex conveyed his interst in the other five acres to Edward, he gave Edward a present possessory interest in fee simple subject to condition subsequent, because Edward was the possessor of the property for as long as the property did not produce IPAs. Alex maintained a future interest in the right of re-entry. The right of re-entry is not a right that automatically takes effect once a condition occurs, so Alex would have to assert his right by reclaiming the land. 5) "," In US v. Craft, Michigan courts held married couples were one person under the law, so Andrew's sale of the property to Chris would likely have been ruled valid, as he sold it for the both of them. This is likely what Debbie would argue for her ownership of the property, because if a court held that Andrew's sale accounted for all interest in it, including Betty's, it would be a valid sale and Debbie would be the rightful owner. However, most states recognize married couples as two different people as tenants in the entirety, and those courts would likely hold that Andrew was not entitled to sell Betty's interest, which would have made Chris a half owner of Greenacre and a joint tenant with Betty. But because Betty outlived Chris, and joint tenancy includes the right of survivorship, the Harms v. Sprague court would have held that Betty would have taken full ownership of the property, making Chris' conveyance to Debbie void because he lost all his interest, and ability to convey it, upon his death. This is what Betty would argue to a court, because it would make her full owner of the property. Betty might also argue that there was a color of title issue in the sale to Chris, so even if Andrew did have a right to sell her interest, the deed was invalid because her signature was forged, which would in turn make Debbie's claim to ownership invalid as well. Debbie, however, might argue that she is the owner by adverse possession. If she were able to tack Chris' ownership to her own, they would have been using the property for 18 years, far beyond the statute of limitation's 10 years. This argument could go over in courts a few different ways. States like Maine, applying the rule from Dombkowski, with a bad faith requirement, would find Debbie's use did not constitute hostile because she did it believing she owned it, which is not in bad faith. She would meet the good faith requirement in the rule from Tieu v. Morgan becase Oregon requires adverse possession be in good faith. Other courts might not find Debbie's use open and notorious because Betty never knew anyone was there, as the court in Marengo v. Ross held that in order to adversely possess property, the original owner and the adverse possessor need to at least be somewhat aware of the existence of property and the fact that it's being used. Debbie is a good faith improver because she built a bigger, better home on the land, ultimately making it more valuable. Even though she technically would probably not be held the true owner of the property according to most courts, the Wetherbee v. Green court held that good faith improvers are entitled to keep their improved product, but owe to the owner of the original materials the value of those materials in their original form. A court may hold that Debbie is7entited to keep the actual home, and pay Betty the value of the proeprty before she improved it, which would likely not be very equitable, or that Debbie is owed some compensation for her efforts.

It is likely under these legal circumstances that a modern court will hold that Betty is the rightful owner of Greenacre, as she retained her own interest and was joint tenants with Chris, who's title was questionable and whom she outlived, and how has a full interest in the home. Furthermore, the fact that Debbie was using the home fully believeing that it was hers and without the knowledge of Betty that she was even there would likely cancel out the hostile and/or notorious and open requirements for adverse possession.

c614b281-222a-49ac-a2ab-6eae987aab4a," O conveyed away a life estate subject to a limitation in a life estate (a defeasible life estate) to Connor and Carla. It is subject to the condition that the first one who retires will get the life estate. It is in life estate beacuse of the words ""for life."" Following the natural termination of the preceding estate, Robert has an indefeasibly vested remainder in life estate, because Robert is ascertainable and in existence and his future interets is not subject to any conditions. It is in life estate beacuse of the words ""for life."" Victor and Vivian both have a vested remainder subject to partial divestment in fee simple absolute. It is vested because the persons are ascertainable and in existence, but their future interest is depended on the condition that they reach the age of 25 and is subject to being divested: the class could open up and let in more people if Oliver had more grandchildren, who also reach the age of 25. It is in fee simple absolute because without language expressing a specific other freehold estate, such as a fee tail or life estate, then a fee simple absolute is the default. The Rule Against Perpetuities (""Rule"") states that no interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest. To work through the Rule, we apply a four step analysis. First, we must determine if the future interest in question is subject to the Rule. Only contingent remainders, vested remainders subject to partial divestment, and executory interests fall under the rule. Here, because Victor and Vivian both have a vested remainder subject to partial divestment, they fall under the Rule. Second, we determine when the perpetuity window begins. In a will it will begin once the testator dies. In a deed, it will begin once the deed is delivered. Because the language just says ""grants"" we will assume it is a deed and effective right now, at deliverance. Third, we must have a relevant life in being to be used as a measuring life. The mesauring lives available to use are Connor, Carla, Robert, Victor, and Vivian. Fourth, we imagine any scenario, even if very unlikely (the Rule does not care about likelihood), where the interest in question vests or forever fails to vest, or for a class gift (as in this scenario), when the class closes. The Rule of Convenience states that as soon as one member of the class is entitled to claiming possession of the title, such as when the preceding estate holder dies and a member in the class has satisfied any conditions and is in existence and entitle to claim language just says ""grants"" we will assume it is a deed and effective right now, at deliverance. Third, we must have a relevant life in being to be used as a measuring life. The mesauring lives available to use are Connor, Carla, Robert, Victor, and Vivian. Fourth, we imagine any scenario, even if very unlikely (the Rule does not care about likelihood), where the interest in question vests or forever fails to vest, or for a class gift (as in this scenario), when the class closes. The Rule of Convenience states that as soon as one member of the class is entitled to claiming possession of the title, such as when the preceding estate holder dies and a member in the class has satisfied any conditions and is in existence and entitle to claim the property, then the class closes. The future interest of Victor does not violate the Rule because if Robert is used as the measuring life, once he dies, Victor, who is 26, has already satisfied the condition of reaching 25. Vivian may violate the Rule, however, because if one member of the class invalidates the Rule, then all members violate the Rule. Vivian could die before reaching 25, therefore invalidating the class. Therefore, because Vivian could violate the Rule, the whole class gift is invalidated by the Rule. The Rule could be rewritten as follows: ""to the first of my children to retire, for life, then to my newphew Robert for life, then to my gandchildren who reach the age of 18."" "," 1a. Brock, In the deed that Alex devised to you, the language was ambiguous: it stated ""to hold jointly as tenants in common."" ""Jointly"" may have meant Alex meaning to create a joint tennacy with you; however, because Alex mentioned ""as tenants in common"" as well, it is more likely than not he intended to create a tenancy in common. When ambiguity in a will is present in the language, courts must apply the rules of construction. According to In the Estate of Dalton Edward Craigen, there are several rules that must be followed. First, the intent of the testator must be drawn from the will, and not the will from the testator. Here, the language looks to be to have intended a tenancy in common. If a joint tenancy were to be made, Alex would have expressed an intention to create such and explicitly state that it was not to be a tenancy in common or he would have explicitly stated that each has a right of survivorship. Second, any are sentences, paragraphs, or provisions in the will that 12 contrary to the whole must be construed as to fit the intention of the testator that was drawn in step one. Here, because the intention likely was for a tenancy in common, the words ""jointly"" should not be construed as a joint tenancy, but rather meaning followed. First, the intent of the testator must be drawn from the will, and not the will from the testator. Here, the language looks to be to have intended a tenancy in common. If a joint tenancy were to be made, Alex would have expressed an intention to create such and explicitly state that it was not to be a tenancy in common or he would have explicitly stated that each has a right of survivorship. Second, any sentences, paragraphs, or provisions in the will that are contrary to the whole must be construed as to fit the intention of the testator that was drawn in step one. Here, because the intention likely was for a tenancy in common, the words ""jointly"" should not be construed as a joint tenancy, but rather meaning tenancy in common. Third, the popular meaning of words is to be used and not technical meanings. ""To hold jointly"" in popular terms means ""together."" ""As tenants in common"" means a common tenancy between the two persons jointly, or in other words, a tenancy in common. Foruth, it is not a court's job to rewrite and revise a will in order to create different results from what the plain meaning results in (Ford v. Allen). There is a preference among the courts to construe ambiguity between the two forms of concurrent estates as creating a tenancy in common: it is the default preference. Joint tenancies are disfavored at common law. Because the language did not expressly and explicitly state a joint tenancy (such as in the phrases ""as joint tenants and not tenants in common"" or ""as joint tenants with the right of survivorship""), you have a tenancy in common with Alex. A tenancy in common is a form of co-ownership where each cotenant owns an undivided, separate, and distinct share of the property. Here, you and Alex each own 50% of the interest in the land. The only unity in a tenancy in common is the unity of possession, meaning each tenant in common has identical rights to enjoyment. The interest is freely alienable: you may convey it or dispose of it how you please. It is also descendable, meaning if you die intestate, the title will pass to your heirs. A tenancy in common may be severed by partition, where one cotenant files a suit for partition, or merger, where the entire interest vests in a single person. If you get ousted, meaning Alex wrongfully excludes you from the property, then you will have a cause of action not to be put out, and to regain possession of the land. A tenant in common may place a mortgage on his interest. The mortgagee can foreclose on the mortgagor's interest, however, and the foreclosure sale will sever the tenancy in common. You may do this, or not, if you desire You have that choice, however. Each cotenant has the right to possess all portions of the property. One cotentant may not exclude another cotenant from any part thereof. However, a cotenant out of possession cannot bring a possessory action unless there has been an ouster. An12ouster occurs when one cotenant wrongfully excludes another cotenant. The ousted tenant would have a cause of action against the possessor not to be put out and to regain possession of the estate. Each cotenant also has the right to retain profits mortgagor's interest, however, and the foreclosure sale will sever the tenancy in common. You may do this, or not, if you desire You have that choice, however. Each cotenant has the right to possess all portions of the property. One cotentant may not exclude another cotenant from any part thereof. However, a cotenant out of possession cannot bring a possessory action unless there has been an ouster. An ouster occurs when one cotenant wrongfully excludes another cotenant. The ousted tenant would have a cause of action against the possessor not to be put out and to regain possession of the estate. Each cotenant also has the right to retain profits gained by his use of the property. A cotenant in possession need not share profits with cotenants out of possession, unless there has been an ouster or an agreement to the contrary (Martin v. Martin). The court in Taylor said that before a cotenant is to be held liabel to pay rent to another cotenant, two essential elements must exist. First, the tenant sought to be charged and who is claimed to be guilty of an ouster must assert exclusive claim to the property in himself. Second, he must give reasonable notice to this effect to the ousted tenant, or his acts must be so open and notorious, postive and assertive, as to place it beyond doubt that he is claiming interest in the whole property. Here, no ouster took place: you did not certainly oust Alex, and Alex did not oust you. You simply are tired of long hours making beer and do not enjoy the smell. Each cotenant also must pay his own costs of repairs. Only when one cotenant has paid more than his pro rata share of the cost of necessary repairs may he compel contribution of a cotenant in an action for accounting or partition. By the same token, a cotenant also must pay his own costs of improvements. The cost of improvement may not be set off in an action for accounting, but in an action for partition may the cost of the improvements be recouped. Furthermore, each cotenant is to pay his own share of the taxes. If one cotenant pays all of the taxes by himself, then and only then may he compel contribution by his cotenants in an action, by enforcing a lien against the property. If you want to make some money from this real estate devleoper (""developer""), and if Alex is not in agreement with your desires, you can file a suit for partition. There is a perference among courts to prefer a partition in kind, which is also known as a ""phsyical partition,"" but practically courts grant partition in sale because partition in kinds often result in one party receiving an unequal value as a result and it is hard to appraise land in a partition in kind. But before a partition in sale is to be granted, two essential elements must exist. First, the location, area, size, and situation of the land must make it so that a partition in kind is inequitable and impracticable. Second, the interest of all of the parties must be best served by a partition in sale (Delfino). Here, because the developer is offering to pay far more than the property is worth, if a court grants a partition in sale, you and Alex will both receive in the short-term a large amount of money, which will be enough for Alex to buy land not too far away and move the partition in sale because partition in kinds often result in one party receiving an unequal value as a result and it is hard to appraise land in a partition in kind. But before a partition in sale is to be granted, two so that essential elements must exist. First, the location, area, size, and situation of the land must make it a partition in kind is inequitable and impracticable. Second, the interest of all of the parties must be best served by a partition in sale (Delfino). Here, because the developer is offering to pay far more than the property is worth, if a court grants a partition in sale, you and Alex will both receive in the short-term a large amount of money, which will be enough for Alex to buy land not too far away and move the brewery there, with money left over. Futhermore, you will receive 50% of those profits (approximately $1,000,000). Alex would argue against a partition in sale because he obviously is likely not eager to pick up and move his business. The location, area, size, and situation all make it impracticable, Alex would argue, to grant a partition in sale. All of his customers know that his business is in a specific location within Bostonia and so he would likely hate to move his business in fear that it makes it harder/more time consuming for customers to come to his place of business. Furthermore, the size, area, and situation of the brewery is across 10 acres of land. That is a large tract of land: a partition in sale, destroying all of the 10 acres, would be very impracticable. Overall, however, you have the better claim, Brock, because you and Alex will receive a large amount of money, and it will be enough for Alex to move in a location that is nearby. I look forward to hearing back from you. I will continue looking into the law to see what else I may do for you. If you have any quesions please do not hesitate to reach me. 1b. Carl, The gold coins that you found are part of a finder's law category known to common law as treasure trove. Treasure trove are coins that have been concealed for such a length of time that the true owner is likely either dead or undiscoverable. The right to possession belongs to the finder good against all the world except the true owner (who, again, is likely dead or undiscoverable). Because you found the coins, under the traditional treasure trove category, you would be the owner of the coins. Howver, some jurisdictions do not recognize the treasure trove category, such as Corliss, which treated the coins that were found in a landowner's driveaway by construction workers working on the property as ""mislaid"" property, meaning that the owner of the locus in quo, the landowner, obtained the right to possession good against the entire world but the true owner. If the court here considers the coins that were found in the warehouse as mislaid property, then the owner of the locus in quo, Alex and Brock, tenants in world except the true owner (who, again, is likely dead or undiscoverable).

If the court here considers the coins that were found in the warehouse as mislaid property, then the owner of the locus in quo, Alex and Brock, tenants in common of the warehouse"" would obtain the right to possession. A court is most likely to construe the coins as mislaid property because they were found in the warehouse. And because of how old the coins are being over 100 years old, the true owner is likely dead so that the right to possession will be in Alex and Brock. However, the coins were in a mesh shopping bag. - Name of store is a local grocery store, which opened only about 10 years ago. - Therefore, it might be argued that the coins are not treasure trove but lost property (involuntary and accidental; do not know where it is) - Local grocery store would have superior title, but the finder would have title good against all but the actual, true owner - It could be argued that it is not the local grocer's, as it was put in an odd location. Mislaid property usually in in places where an owner would put it. List property is where you find propery in odd places. When you received a claim ticket with a number on it and a tag with the same number on your growler, a bailment had occurred. A bailment is a transfer of possession of an item of personal property by one bailor to one bailee for the accomplishment of a certain purpose. A bailee must consensually agree to the transfer of possession and must have knowledge of the presence of the article being transferred. Here, the bailor was you, Carl, and you had possession of the growler. The bailee was the bartender who worked for the brewery, who you transferred possession of the growler to. Because of the employee-employer relationship, the brewery would actually be the true bailee. The bartender, employed by the brewery, was to assume reasonable care over the bailed good, even if that bartender was not the exact bartender you transferred your growler to. Because fault of the growler being dropped and broken was by a co-worker of the bailee, brewery, fault for the damage of your good falls on the bailee, brewery. You have a cause of action to recover damages for your loss. When you left your coat at the warefouse on one of the hooks by the front door, you intentionally and bartender who worked for the brewery, who you transferred possession of the growler to. Because of the employee-employer relationship, the brewery would actually be the true bailee. The bartender, employed by the brewery, was to assume reasonable care over the bailed good, even if that bartender was not the exact bartender you transferred your growler to. Because fault of the growler being dropped and broken was by a co-worker of the bailee, brewery, fault for the damage of your good falls on the bailee, brewery. You have a cause of action to recover damages for your loss. When you left your coat at the warefouse on one of the hooks by the front door, you intentionally and voluntarily placed it there. Because you cannot find it now, and because you mislaid your property at the brewery, the coat is now a ""mislaid property,"" according to common law. You should post notice to the police station of the town or make public notice that you lost your coat, if you really want to get it back. The finder, theif, who allegedly stole your jacket from the hook has an invalid ""superior title"" against others because he took it by theft. Therefore, title of the coat is rendered voidable (Kotis). If you find someone with your coat, you have a right to obtain title; you have a superior title to the coat. If you find the person who allegedly stole it, you may bring an action in court if the thief does not relinquish possession. 1c. When there is ambiguity in the language in a will between a fee simple determinable and a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the modern view is for courts to prefer a fee simple subject to condition subsequent with the future interest holder receiving a right of reentry. There is a general policy in the courts to avoid forfeiture of estates. A fee simple subject to condition subsequent with a right of reentry in the future interest holder means that the foreiture of the future interest holder is optional rather than automatic (as with a possibility of reverter) (Mahrenholz). Therefore, though there is both durational language indicating a fee simple determinable (""so long as the proeperty is used for residential uses only"") and conditional language indicating a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (""if it is ever used for non-resdential uses""), the court will construe it to be a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Therefore, David would have a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. It is the present possessory interest of fee simple because no language explicitly states otherwise. Frank and Fred would have a shifting executory interest in fee simple absolute because title passes from grantee (David) to another grantee (Frank and Fred) upon the hapenning of the stated event. It is fee simple absolute because that is the default in common law if there is no express language to create another freehold estate. In the other deed, Alex conveyed away a fee simple subject to condition subsequent to Edward, possessory interest of fee simple because no language explicitly states otherwise. Frank and Fred would have a shifting executory interest in fee simple absolute because title passes from grantee (David) to another grantee (Frank and Fred) upon the hapenning of the stated event. It is fee simple absolute because that is the default in common law if there is no express language to create another freehold estate. In the other deed, Alex conveyed away a fee simple subject to condition subsequent to Edward, because of the conditonal language ""so long as the premises are never used to make IPAs, and if IPAs are ever made on the premises..."" It is in fee simple absolute for the same reasons stated previously before. Alex would have a right of reentry in fee simple absolute. Right of reentry always follows a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Alex must, though, exercise the power of termination by either suing or reentering the premises. Alex's claims against David 1. Because the property is used for non-residential uses (commercial stores), then title passes to Frank and Fred. 2. Alex's claims against Edward 1. Beacause Edward decided to begin making IPAs, that also ticks the condition in the deed from Alex to Edward, and therefore Alex has the right to reenter the premises. "," Andrew and Bettty owned multiple pieces of real estate, including Greenacre, as tenants by the entirety. A tenancy by the entirety is a form of co-ownership that is owned by a husband and wife as one marital union. There are five unities in a tenancy by the entirety. Time, interest must vest at the same time. Title, interest must be acquired by the same instrument. Interest, interest must be of the same type and duration. Possession, each tenant must have identical rights to enjoyment. Person, the maritual union as ""one human being.""

It may also be severed by divorce, destroying the unity of Andrew and Bettty owned multiple pieces of real estate, including Greenacre, as tenants by the entirety. A tenancy by the entirety is a form of co-ownership that is owned by a husband and wife as one marital union. There are five unities in a tenancy by the entirety.

A tenancy by the entirety may be severed by a mutual consenting, joining in, of both the husband and wife in a conveyance. It may also be severed by divorce, destroying the unity of person. It may be severed by death of one spouse, but title will pass to the surviving spouse because of the right of survivorship. It may also be severed by execution of a joint creditor of both husband and wife; execution by one creditor cannot levy upon the estate owned by the entirety. In a tenancy by the entirety, neither spouse may partition or unilaterally convey his or her interest. When Alex sold Greenacre to Chris, he unilaterally conveyed away his interest in the estate. This was an ineffective transfer of title, as one tenant by the entirety may not unilaterally convey away his or her interest. Chris now is operating under a color of title. In order for a person to claim title to a land through adverse possession, a party must satisfy the five common law elements of adverse possession and establish that the statute of limitations for ejectment has run. The five common law elements of adverse possession are posstession that is (1) actual, (2) open and notorious, (3) exclusive, (4) hostile or adverse and under a claim of right, and (5) continuous. (1) Actual possession means the adverse possessor phsyically enters the land, using the land in a manner that an owner of that particular type of property would use the land. Chris was actually present on the land, 8 weeks a year. Chris enlarged and insulated the small wooden cabin which is an act that an owner of that particular type of property would use it. Debbie also built a house on that 50 acre parcel of land. That is not an uncommon act for an owner to do on such a large portion of property. Debbie lived there year-round as she built a house on the land and moved there in 2011. (2) Open and notorious possession means the adverse possessor visibly displays dominion or control over the land, as to give notice to the true owner that his land is being adversely possessed. Again, Chris enlarging and insulating the small wooden cabin is an act that constitutes dominion over the land. The same goes for Debbie building a house. Debbie would argue that building a house does not happen silently or quickly, and so there were plenty of opportunities for Betty to find out, but she never cared to visit Greenacre until 2019. In Marengo Cave, the court found that the open and notorious element was not satisfied because the opening of plaintiff's cave was not visible to the defendant, who were both simultaneously occupying the same parcel of land. Here, Betty never was never put on notice, either over the land, as to give notice to the true owner that his land is being adversely possessed. Again, Chris enlarging and insulating the small wooden cabin is an act that constitutes dominion over the land. The same goes for Debbie building a house. Debbie would argue that building a house does not happen silently or quickly, and so there were plenty of opportunities for Betty to find out, but she never cared to visit Greenacre until 2019. In Marengo Cave, the court found that the open and notorious element was not satisfied because the opening of plaintiff's cave was not visible to the defendant, who were both simultaneously occupying the same parcel of land. Here, Betty never was never put on notice, either constructive or otherwise, about the dominion and control by Chris and then Debbie, so therefore this element would not be satisfied. Betty would have the better claim. (3) Exclusive possession is when an adverse possessor does not share the land with the true owner or the public at large. Chris clearly shared the land and let his neighbors hunt and fish on the land. Debbie further allowed the neighbors to hunt on all but the two acres around her house. This would defeat the exclusive possession. Debbie might argue that she did not let others on to all the areas of the land (""with the exception of the two acres around her house, which they are not allowed to enter without her permission""), but I think Betty would have the better claim, saying what was previously stated, that it is clear that Chris and Debbie shared the land with others. (4) Hostile or adverse and under a claim of right means the adverse possessor uses the land non- permissively. Chris and Debbie never asked for permission from Betty, though Chris did get permission from Andrew through the purported conveyance: Chris and Debbie believed they owned the property that Andrew and Betty actually owned. Under the majority of jurisdictions that follow the majority rule in French v Pearce, the state of mind of the adverse possessor is irrelelvant. Here, it does not matter whether Chris is adversely possessing the land in good faith or bad faith, or whether or not he is adversely possessing the land under a claim of right or color of title. The mere fact that he was adversely possessing is enough. However, in a minority of jurisdictions that follow the rule in Dombkowski v. Ferland, also known as the Maine rule or the ""aggressive trespasser"" standard, there is a bad faith requirement in the adverse possessor, meaning that he must know that the land he is occupying is not his and intend to claim title to it beyond the boundary lines. Chris honestly believed that he was the rightful owner of the property when Andrew conveyed to Chris, even though the conveyance was invalid. Chris has no bad faith, and therefore would fail in a minority of jurisdictions. Another of minority jurisdictions follow the rule in Tieu v. Morgan (Oregon), which, on the other hand, require the adverse possessor to display good faith, meaning that he must hoestly believe that the land he is adversely possessing is his. Here, contrasted11toofthe 12 Maine rule, Chris would satisfy it as he honestly believed the conveyance was legitimate and valid. that he was the rightful owner of the property when Andrew conveyed to Chris, even though the conveyance was invalid. Chris has no bad faith, and therefore would fail in a minority of jurisdictions. Another of minority jurisdictions follow the rule in Tieu v. Morgan (Oregon), which, on the other hand, require the adverse possessor to display good faith, meaning that he must hoestly believe that the land he is adversely possessing is his. Here, contrasted to the Maine rule, Chris would satisfy it as he honestly believed the conveyance was legitimate and valid. (5) Continuous possession means the adverse possessor possesses the land uninterruptedly. This does not literally mean never leaving the property; but rather, using the land in a manner relative to particular property's purpose. In a summer house for example, using the land every summer will not destroy the continuous element (Howard). Chris would use the land about 8 weeks a year for 8 years. Debbie would live there all year-round. Because both Chris and his descendant Debbie used the land uninterruptedly, this satisfies the continuous element. Betty was out of possession until in 2019 when she decided she never had been to Greenacre. The statute of limitations for ejectment must have run. The relevant limitations period is 10 years, but if the true owner is disabled at the time the cause of action accrues (when the adverse possessor begings possessing adversely), then it is 7 years after the disability is removed. A party may tack on years of the predecessor, but only when the adverse possessor and the predecessor are in privity (Tieu). Privity is established by devise, descent, or deed purporting to convey title. There is no tacking of disabilities. Here, Chris began adversely possessing in 2001, under a color of title. There were no disabilities of the true owner Andrew and Betty, so therefore we do not need to worry about disabilities. This means that unless the cause of action is brought by 2011, Debbie, who is a descendant of Chris (daughter; in privity), will acquire possession to the land. No action was brought by Betty before 2011, and therefore Debbie owns the land. ",713,3123,1602
cda90e6a-9bfb-4642-bd33-c68cd56ff865," Oliver Owner's has a present possessory interest; the first of Oliver Owner's children to retire has a contingent remainder in a life estate; Robert has a vested remainder in a life estate; Oliver Owner's grandchildren who reach the age of 25 have a vested remainder subject to partial divestment in fee simple. We apply the Rule against Perpetuities in order to limit dead hand control of property. Any interest that will not necessarily vest within a life in being at the time of the grant plus 21 years is void under this doctrine. The RAP doctrine applies to contingent remainders, vested remainders subject to partial divestment, and executory interests. In Oliver Owner's grant, Connor and Carla have alternative contingent remainders meaning the vesting of one of their interests will knock out the interest of the other however, it is possible that both sibblings will die before either retire and this interest is therefore void under RAP. RAP does not apply to Robert's vested remainder in a life estate is therefore valid. The grandchildren's interest would traditionally be void under RAP because the class is open and unassertained children could be born and consequently not turn 25 within the life time + 21 years of a life in being at the time of the grant. However, the Rule of Convenience applies in this case because Victor is a life in being and is ready to take possession as he is over the age of 25 therefore both Victor and Vivian's future interests are valid under RAP. The Rule of Convenience is used to protect the future interests of lives in being who are part of an open class and essentially closes the class at the time the grant is given. Those who are lives in being at the time of the grant but have yet to meet the critera are not removed from the class however they must meet the criteria before their interest can vest. After applying RAP the grant should read: ""To my nephew Robert for life, then to my granchildren who reach the age of 25."" "," 1A) This issue at hand is whether or not Brock has transferrable title in his co-tennancy with Alex. A common tenancy is when 2 or more people share a common, undivided property interest. Typically, co-tenants are able to sever their agreement via partition in sale or partition in kind. Additionally, unlike joint tenancy, co-tenants are able to transfer their partial interest via grant, devise, sale, or will and in doing so, the co-tenant abolishes any title or interest they previously held in the property. Brock may chose to sever his and Alex's tenancy in common via partition. Courts typically prefer partition in kind (physically dividing the property into new, separate titles) however, partition in sale (selling the whole property interest and dividing the profit between co-tenants) is more common due to the difficulties that are associated with partition in kind (case where woman owned family trash business). A partition in sale is typically chosen when partition in kind is too difficult or impossible - possibly due to lack of access roads, unequal value in different areas of the property, etc. or when partition in sale serves both parties interests. In order to make money from the developer, Brock would have to ask his brother for a partition in kind of the property interests as it does not seem that his brother Alex could be convinced to sell or move his brewery to another location. Brock would likely recieve the property that is not being inhabited by the brewery and may want to check with the developer how much money he would recieve for his part of the land. Additionally, Brock may recieve a larger piece of land than his brother as they have an equal interest in the property but the area where the brewery is located is likely much more profitable than the undeveloped land. Alternitively, if the land is split 50/50 during a partition in kind, Brock may recieve an owelty from Alex due to the higher value of the land where the brewery is located - owelty is used to make the partition financially equal for all parties involved. Additionally, Brock could see if the developer would be interested in buying his fractional property interest. This could be done without the consent of his brother because co-tenants are able to transfer their interests independently of their concurrent interest holders. For the reasons stated above, Brock would likely 3make the most money if he chooses to sever his co- tennancy with his brother via partition in kind with an owelty and then sells his portion of the property to the developer. Additionally, Brock could see if the developer would be interested in buying his fractional property interest. This could be done without transfer the consent of his brother because co-tenants are able to their interests independently of their concurrent interest holders. For the reasons stated above, Brock would likely make the most money if he chooses to sever his co- tennancy with his brother via partition in kind with an owelty and then sells his portion of the property to the developer. 1B) The issue at hand is whether Carl has obtained claim of the gold coins through finders law. There are four types of found property - lost, mislaid, abandoned, and treasure trove/embedded. Lost property is property that one unitentionally loses, drops, etc. and the finder of lost property has a claim to it that is good against the world except the true owner. Mislaid property is property that one intentionally places somewhere and then walks away, forgets where it is, etc., the owner of the land where the mislaid property is left has a claim good against the world except the true owner. Abandoned property is property that one intentionally disposes of, throws away, etc. and the finder has a claim good against the world, including the true owner because in abandoning it, they relenquished their right of title. Finally, treasure trove or embedded property is valuable property that has been concealed and hidden with care to appear that the true owner intends to return for it. Treasure trove is not typically recongized today because it requires the true owner to likely be dead and the finder has a claim good against the entire world. It is not likely that in 2019 there is much burried treasure left by individuals who are now dead to be found and consequently, courts often rule items like this to be embedded property. The property owner of the place where the embedded property was found has a claim good against the world. (Corliss v. Wenner & The case where the money was concealed in the wing of the airplane). If the court finds that the gold coins are considered treasure trove, then Carl would have superior claim to them as the finder. If the court finds that the gold coins are embedded property (as they were embedded in the wall of the warehouse) then Alex and Brock have a superior claim as property owners of the warehouse. Because the coins had the nearby and recently opened grocery store's name on them, it is unlikely that the true owner is dead and the court would likely hold that they are embedded property and therefore Alex and Brock have a superior claim to the gold coins. The issue at hand is whether Carl created a bailment with the bartender when he gave him his growler to fill and can recieve damages for the loss of his property. A bailment is created when a title owner of the warehouse. Because the coins had the nearby and recently opened grocery store's name on them, it is unlikely that the true owner is dead and the court would likely hold that they are embedded property and therefore Alex and Brock have a superior claim to the gold coins. The issue at hand is whether Carl created a bailment with the bartender when he gave him his growler to fill and can recieve damages for the loss of his property. A bailment is created when a title owner (bailor) gives temporary possession to another (bailee) while maintaining title. There are implied bailments that occur when the delivery of one's property to another is represented by a claim ticket, coat tag, valet tag, etc. or actual bailments which are created when the bailor and bailee enter into a contract to represent the temporary transfer of possession. Since the bartender gave Carl a claim ticket with a number matching a tag placed on his growler and presentation of the claim ticket was required to get the growler back an implied bailment relationship was likely created (Allen v. Hyatt Regency). Carl would likely be able to recieve damages from the brewery or the bartender who broke his growler but not both. The issue at hand is whether Carl has abandoned or mislaid his coat and if he still has any remaining title to this property. It is likely that the coat will be considered abandonded by Carl. Carl saying ""Forget it"" as he walked out of the brewery after failing to find the coat means that he likely relenquished all title he had to it. 1C) When Alex conveyed the 5 acres to David Developer, he granted a fee simple subject to executory limitation and gave his son's an executory interest in the property. Once the land is used for non- residential function, David will have violated the terms on which he was given the property and Alex's sons, Fank and Fred, will gain automatic possession of the land due to their executory interest which cuts short the present possessor's interest. When Alex conveyed the 5 acres of land to Edward, the language was identical however, he created a future grant in himself, the grantor, and therefore Edward may have a fee simple determinable and Alex has a possibility of reverter should the brewery ever be used to make IPAs. The courts could also find that Alex gave Edward a fee simple subject to condition subsequent since the language was conflicting and semi-ambiguous, this would create a right of entry for Alex. If the court decides that Edward has a fee simple determinable then Alex would automatically regain title the moment Edward started making When Alex conveyed the 5 acres of land to Edward, the language was identical however, he created a future grant in himself, the grantor, and therefore Edward may have a fee simple determinable and Alex has a possibility of reverter should the brewery ever be used to make IPAs. The courts could also find that Alex gave Edward a fee simple subject to condition subsequent since the language was conflicting and semi-ambiguous, this would create a right of entry for Alex. If the court decides that Edward has a fee simple determinable then Alex would automatically regain title the moment Edward started making IPAs. If the court decides that Edward has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, then Alex would have to take action to regain his title of the property as it is not automatic. Courts typically prefer fee simple subject to condition subsequent when the language is ambiguous due to the action required by the grantor to regain title which makes it less likely for the title to change. Based on this analysis, it is likely that Edward needs to take legal action and he will regain title of the 5 acres via right of entry. "," The issue at hand is whether Debbie has obtained all, part, or none of Greenacre through color of title and adverse possession. Color of title is when title is passed fraudulently and therefore, the recipient believes they have true title of the property but in fact, they do not. In order to obtain land via adverse possession, the adverse possessor must have possession outrunning the statute of limitations and the possession must be continuous, hostile, exclusive, actual, notorious and open. Adverse possession encourages property owners to make use of their land in a productive way because otherwise, they may lose possession entirely. In 2001, Andrew conveyed Greenacre to Chris via color of title however, Chris purchased in good faith and did not suspect any fraud by Andrew. When Chris died in 2009, he conveyed his color of title to Debbie who also had no reason to believe her title was invalid. Throughout his time on Greenacre, Chris regularly visited the property and fulfilled all elements of adverse possession. Although he did not live on Greenacre year round, he did visit regularly (continuous), he did possess without true permission (hostile), neighbors were allowed to be on the property only with his permission (exclusive), actual (he occupied the cabin 8 weeks a year and made physical improvements), and possesed all of the land (notorious and open). When Debbie obtained title to Greenacre she maintained this pattern of adverse possession and even moved to the property full time. Additionally, Chris' possession time can be tacked onto Debbie's because she was voluntarily given the land with the presumption that she would use it in the same way as he prior possessor (I cant adverse possession. Although he did not live on Greenacre year round, he did visit regularly (continuous), he did possess without true permission (hostile), neighbors were allowed to be on the property only with his permission (exclusive), actual (he occupied the cabin 8 weeks a year and made physical improvements), and possesed all of the land (notorious and open). When Debbie obtained title to Greenacre she maintained this pattern of adverse possession and even moved to the property full time. Additionally, Chris' possession time can be tacked onto Debbie's because she was voluntarily given the land with the presumption that she would use it in the same way as he prior possessor (I cant remember this term!, Tieu v. Morgan). Although Debbie only inhabits the 50 acres of land, Betty does not make use of any of Greenacre. When an adverse possessor gains title via color of title, they are awarded title to the portion of land they make use of if the true property owner is also in physically present on the property however, when the true title holder is not making use of or in physical possession of any of the land then the adverse possessor can gain title to the entire piece of land via adverse possession under color of title. It is clear that Debbie and Chris have met all elements of adverse possession and can add their years of possession together - meaning that Debbie has been adversely possessing Greenacre for 18 years. If the statute of limitations is less than 18 years, it is likely that Debbie will have obtained title to all of Greenacre.

02694d63-a2bc-45b7-98fd-77c89066e667," O to the first of my children to retire, for life, then to my newphew Robert for life, then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25."" Victor is 26, Vivian is 17. Interests: Connor and Carla has a vested remainder subject to open in life estate Robert has a shifting executory interest in life estate Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple Vivian has a contingent remainder in fee simple Analysis: If Oliver Owner is the measuring life, at his death plus 21 years is where the calulations first start. At Owner's death + 21 years, the interests must either vest or fail to vest for it to be not violating the Rule of Perpetuities. First, we measure Connor and Carla who have vested remainders subject to open. This is subjected to RAP which is applicable only to vested remainders subject to open, options, executory limits, and contingent remainders. We must test each interest that is subject to RAP, because even if one is validating then RAP will be valid. Since, Connor and Carla have vested remainders subject to open, we test this first. At the time of Owner's death + 21 years, we will not know at that time who would retire first to be able to get the estate for life. Carla and Connor could be very hard workers and never retire, and there is no indication that one must retire at a certain age, nor the age of Carla and Connor at the time of death. So far, RAP would be violated because we will not know who is to retire at the time of Owner's death + 21 years. Next, Robert is also subject to RAP with a shifting executory interest in life estate. RAP would be satisfied becuase there are nothing that he has to fulfill, he's alive and everything. Now, there is the grandchildren, who are also subject to RAP. At the time of the grant, Victor is 26, so he already satisfies the clause needed to get the fee simple. At the time of Owner's death + 21 years, We estate for life. Carla and Connor could be very hard workers and never retire, and there is no indication that one must retire at a certain age, nor the age of Carla and Connor at the time of death. So far, RAP would be violated because we will not know who is to retire at the time of Owner's death + 21 years. Next, Robert is also subject to RAP with a shifting executory interest in life estate. RAP would be satisfied becuase there are nothing that he has to fulfill, he's alive and everything. Now, there is the grandchildren, who are also subject to RAP. At the time of the grant, Victor is 26, so he already satisfies the clause needed to get the fee simple. At the time of Owner's death + 21 years, We will know if she turns 25 or ,(hopefully not this scenario), dies. Both of them satisfy RAP. The rewritten language should read: Oliver Owner grants his property ""to my newphew Robert for life, then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25."" 2) "," Answer to A There are a few different options for this scenario. You (Brock) have a joint tenancy. There are 3 types of ownership, (1) tenancy in common, (2) joint tenancy, and (3) tenancy by entirety. (1) A tenancy in common is a type of ownership in which each person has a fractional share of a piece of land. Have the rights to exclude (third parties), use, abandon, and profit off of the land. (2) Joint Tenancy has all of the rights of a tenancy in common except all of the land is owned jointly (no fractional shares). Additionally the joint tenancy has a right of surviviorship which means that when you die could inherit the property. (3) A tenancy by entirety is only for people who are married. But also has all of the rights as a joint tenancy. But be severed by joint consent or divorce. When a joint tenancy is severed the land then must be partitioned. Delfino v. Velancis. There are two ways that a land can be partitioned, a partition by sale or a partition by kind. A partition by sale means that the land gets sold and then each of the tenants recieve a portion of the money that was gotten for be the land. A partition by kind means that the land can 9 parted unevenly according to the different circumstances that one is under and be able to split the property and have it be equal (in terms of land/money- so if the land is 40% of the land, then you can be paid for the other 10% of the land etc.) tenancy. But be severed by joint consent or divorce. When a joint tenancy is severed the land then must be partitioned. Delfino v. Velancis. There are two ways that a land can be partitioned, a partition by sale or a partition by kind. A partition by sale means that the land gets sold and then each of the tenants recieve a portion of the money that was gotten for the land. A partition by kind means that the land can be parted unevenly according to the different circumstances that one is under and be able to split the property and have it be equal (in terms of land/money- so if the land is 40% of the land, then you can be paid for the other 10% of the land etc.) Courts favor a partition by kind (Delfino v. Velancis) because then there is no need to value the property/find a seller all done by the courts. It is much easier to look at the circumstances, and partition accordingly. Here, because there are 10 acres of land, and there is an old warehouse, brewery, and a tasting room. There is still unused space that could be sold off to the developer. Furthermore, one could say that your brother Alex did not create a joint tenancy correctly. One of the requirements of a joint tenancy is to enter into acquiring the property at the same time. Because Alex bought it in 2001 and you only joined the business in 2003, the timing to create the joint tenancy is off. Alex would have to bring in a third party to then convey the land back to the both of you, or the land would then revert to being a tenancy in common. (Harms v. Sprague- brought in a third party). If the court considers this a tenancy in common, which could be plausible because of the timing even though there was explicit intent by saing ""jointly tenants in common"", and the fact that you pay Alex a sum of money for 1/ the business and 1/ the warehouse site, then you could sell of your share of the land to the real estate developer. Answer to B Dear Carl, Thank you for reaching out and telling me your story. After consulting various secondary treatises and property law, I have found some answers to the questions posed, of which I will answer below. First, are the gold coins. The relevant sub-topic of property law that this applies to is the law of finders. Within the law of finders, there are four categories for how things are found: (1) Abandoned (2) Mislaid (3) Lost (4) Treasure Trove, and in some states there is a fifth category called embedded. (1) Abandoned property: the previous owner wanted to give up all claims on the item and voluntarily relinquished all claims and voluntarily abandoned (left) the item somewhere. (2) Mislaid property: the person did not voluntarily give up the claims to the item, but does not know where it is. (EX: Corliss v. Wenner, Benjamin v. Linder Airport) Within the law of finders, there are four categories for how things are found: (1) Abandoned (2) Mislaid (3) Lost (4) Treasure Trove, and in some states there is a fifth category called embedded. (1) Abandoned property: the previous owner wanted to give up all claims on the item and voluntarily relinquished all claims and voluntarily abandoned (left) the item somewhere. (2) Mislaid property: the person did not voluntarily give up the claims to the item, but does not know where it is. (EX: Corliss v. Wenner, Benjamin v. Linder Airport) (3) Lost: the person voluntarily gave up claims and does know where the item is. (4) Treasure Trove: An item that is found that is found burried/excavated/etc. that is extremely old and the owner would be long dead. (Think of a pirates treasure, or a historical painting). (5)? Embedded: is specifically for items that are found in the earth (usually applicable to clay pots, and things found deeper in the earths crust). Like treasure trove the owner is probably long dead by the time the item/s are found. As stated previously, we would have to look further into the jurisdiction of New Suffolk/Bostonia if they consider treasure trove and embedded to be the same or different category. Now, listening to your story, it seems that you might not have claims to the coins that you found after dropping your cell phone on the floor and finding the bag after seeing the coins reflect in the light. I would conclude that it is likely that the coins that you found are mislaid property. It is most likely mislaid property because the person who hid the coins knew that they were being hidden, but had never come back to retrive the property, most likely because he does not know where the proerpty was left. It is not treasure trove becuase it was found in a mesh shopping bag from a local grocery store which was only established 10 years ago. Therefore, it can be concluded that the person is still alive, but has just never retrived the coins. It is not embedded (if applicable here) because the coins were not buried down far enough/not enough time has passed to asusme that the owner would be dead, and it was found under a wall, not in deep in the earth's crust. It is not lost property, that the previous owner voluntarily gave up the claims and knows the location of the coins, but has not yet retrived it. It could be abandoned property because the owner has not yet retrived it, made claims to it and cold have relinquished all claims to it. But, it is more likely that it is mislaid property because even though a considerable amount of time has passed, it was put in a place in which it could easily be retived by someone who knew the property (it could be retrived just as easily as you did). The owner could have left it in a more open place instead of concealed if5itofwas9 truly abandoned. If it is mislaid property then the ownership does not go to the person who found the items, but to the abandoned property because the owner has not yet retrived it, made claims to it and cold have relinquished all claims to it. But, it is more likely that it is mislaid property because even though a considerable amount of time has passed, it was put in a place in which it could easily be retived by someone who knew the property (it could be retrived just as easily as you did). The owner could have left it in a more open place instead of concealed if it was truly abandoned. If it is mislaid property then the ownership does not go to the person who found the items, but to the person who owns the land it is on. In Corliss v. Wenner, a construction worker found coins in the driveway and laid claim to it. Like in Wenner in which the court held that the coins were mislaid property becuase it was not old enough for treasure trove, the ownership belonged to the person that was the owner of the property that it was on. In Benjamin v. Linder Aviation, there was a considerable amount of money found on a plane going to routine inspection, and the court held that it belong to the bank because the bank owned the plane. Here seems to follow suit, in which, if it is considered mislaid property the ownership would revert to the person who owns the piece of property, which would be the two brothers, Alex and Brock who own the brewery. In terms of the growler, it seems that there is a bailment relationship here. In this scenario you would be the bailor (the person who owned the growler) and the bailee would be the bartender. You relinquished control of your item, the growler so that they could fill it with the new beer. This could be a bailment becuase you created a relationship with the bar, that they would do something in return for you doing something else. In Hyatt Nashvile Hotel, the court held that there was an implied bailment as a result of payment and security, in which here you got a claim ticket and your growler was tagged. At the same time, it could also not be an implied bailment, since there is always a chance that glass can break and accidents do happen at bars. For the coat, when you left the bar and did not tell the bar to look for your coat, and you left without looking for it, you most likely abandoned that piece of property because you relinquished all control of it and do not know where it is. But since you involuntarily do not know where it is, it could also be considered misplaid property. Please let me know if you would like to further discuss my legal findings. Best, Answer to C Edward Please let me know if you would like to further discuss my legal findings. Best, Answer to C Edward Interests: Edward has a fee simple subject to condition to subsequent (determined by the as long as language and is a grantee) and Alex has a right to entry (determined by ""reentry"" and will revert back to the grantor). In the deed, it states that Edward is not allowed to make IPAs, if so then Alex can claim the property back. If Edward is making IPAs which was explicitly stated as a condition of something not to do, then Alex has a claim to get the piece of proerpty back. David David has a fee simple subject to condition to subsequent (determined by as long as), Frank and Fred both have a shifting executory interest (shifting because it is given to someone other than the grantor, and is executory interest becuase it will be given to a third party). David is yes, using the property for residential units, but also using it for another purpose (ground floor commercial stores). Since, David is using it for something that was explicitly stated then it would go to Fred and Frank Alex's sons). There could be a technical arguement made for that the buildings property is used for residential purposes (the buildings are mainly for apartments) and the commercial businesses operate as a part of the residential complexes. (Outside example: undergraduate dormitories that also have mini marts or food services on one floor, but it is still considered a residential area). 3) "," Betty originally has a tenancy by entirety with her husband, which is a classification of ownership that is only allowe to be given to married couples. To sever a tenancy by entirety there must be consent between both parties or a divorce. Since there was no divorce, the tenancy by entirety was never severed. Greenacre was fully owned by the couple, they could enjoy quite a few rights like the right to exclude, survivorship, use, and profit from the property. They both had valid claims and ownership to the property because with explicit permission of the owner his neighbors were allowed to conduct hunting activities on the land.

They both had valid claims and ownership to the property because with explicit permission of the owner his neighbors were allowed to conduct hunting activities on the land. Chris is most likely a good faith purchaser because he did not know that the deed that he recieved from Andrew was under forged, and Andrew did have a legitimate ownership to the property. For Debbie, there could be a claim of adverse possession as to the property. Debbie did not know that she was living on the land that had a forged signature and was sold to her father under false pretenses. When she got the property after her father's death, she believed that the property was hers and that she acquired it legally (had the deed that Chris and Andrew/Fake Betty signed). Adverse possession must satisfy several criteria in addition to fulfilling the statute of limitations: (1) Open and notorious: satisfied. (2) Hostile: Possibly satisfied, doesn't know that there is a claim to the land until she talks to Betty. (In the fact pattern, says that she drives up and sees Debbie on the porch, but could have just backed out of the driveway and not talked to Debbie, and therefore she does not know it is hostile). (3) Exclusive: Debbie had 50 acres of land of which she used to live on. As stated above, an owner has the right to let other people use it as long as there was explicit instructions that that was allowed. Allowed neighbors to continue to hunt on Greenacre (key word: allows, so has her permission). Exclusive is satisfied. (4) Continuous: Debbie would have the most trouble arguing this point. Depending on the statute of limitations, Chris occupied the lands from 2000-2009 and had continuous usage of the cabin (not extremely sporadic). Debbie did not start living on the property until 2011, which leaves a two year gap to it being continuous. Debbie could argue that she was readying the property to improve the cabin, or maybe she visited it frequently. Betty could argue that she was not continuous in her possession of the land for 2010 and until when she was living on the land in 2011. (5) Actual: Has possession of the land, uses it like 9 owner would. Actual is satisfied. any Betty and Debbie could each raise color of title, in which when there is a property that is purchased extremely sporadic). Debbie did not start living on the property until 2011, which leaves a two year gap to it being continuous. Debbie could argue that she was readying the property to improve the cabin, or maybe she visited it frequently. Betty could argue that she was not continuous in her possession of the land for 2010 and until when she was living on the land in 2011. (5) Actual: Has possession of the land, uses it like any owner would. Actual is satisfied. Betty and Debbie could each raise color of title, in which when there is a property that is purchased under a defective title (such as no signature, no legitimate deed) then there is possibility to claim at least part of the property, if not all of it. Circumstances would have to depend on what a judge thinks is necessary. Arguments for Betty: it was her property and it was sold under a forged deed, therefore it is still her land. Arguements against Betty: she never visited it for a certain amount**** Debbie could help her case by saying that both her dad and herself were good faith improvers, expanding the cabin and building a year-round house on the land. Rights of Betty Argue that debbie was not always continuous on the land and could not acqurie by adverse possession. Hasn't confronted Debbie yet, so could just talk to her and come to a conclusion/agreement. ",534,2040,827
afaca025-5d82-46e8-bfba-a1ce2167adca," Olivers children, Connor and Carla, would have future contingent remainders in life estates. This is contingent because it is the first child to retire, therefore their interest is contingent on who retires first. Oliver's unbord children would also have a contingent remainder in life estate, should Oliver have more children before he dies. Robert has a vested remainder in life estate. Oliver's living grandchild victor has a remainder in fee simple subject to partial/open divestment. Oliver's other grandchild, Vivian, has a contingent remainder in fee simple, as she would need to reach age 25. The rule against perpetuities requires that interests vest within 21 years of all validating life in beings at the time of the conveyance. In this case, there are multiple life in beings at the time of the conveyance. The conveyance ""to the first of my children to retire, for life"" would not be void under RAP. This is because at the time of the conveyance, both Carla and Connor are alive so they can be the validating lives in being. The phrase ""retire"" could be ambigious, considering if when you die you technically do retire. If we are to assume that death constitutes retiring then whenever Carla or Connor die, that interest will then vest. The next interest would be the the ""nephew robert for life."" This conveyance would also be valid under the RAP. At the time of the grant Robert is also alive, and thus can also be treated as his own validating life ion being. Thus, at Roberts death, his interest will either vest or not. The last conveyance is to Olivers ""grandchildren who reach the age of 25."" At the time of the grant, Victor and Vivian are also alive and thus can be used as validating lives in being. At the time of the conveyance Victor has already reached the age of 25, so he would fulfill his contingency. However, this interest interest could be void under RAP because, if Victor and vivian died, it would take more than 21 years for another grandchilds interest to vest or not. However, the rule of convenience could apply here. Seeing as Victor will have already fulfilled the requirement of being 25, his class could then close, thus making it valid. However, if the rule of conveinience does not apply here, then the language of the grant would rewrite to be, ""To the first of my children to retire, for life, then to my nephew Robert for life."" And in that scenerio then Oliver's estate would have a reversion in fee simple. interest could be void under RAP because, if Victor and vivian died, it would take more than 21 years for another grandchilds interest to vest or not.

And in that scenerio then Oliver's estate would have a reversion in fee simple. "," 1A. Brock and his brother Alex hold a tenancy in common. Although the language of the deed created, ""Jointly as tennants in common,"" is somewhat ambiguous as the phrase jointly makes it sound as if they wanted to create a joint tenancy, rather than a tenancy in common. However, Joint tenancies typically are only recognized if both owners obtain the property at the same time with the same instrument. In this case, because of the ambiguous language and the lack of a straw man to convey the property to Brock and Alex at the same time with the same instrument, a court will likely find this to be a tenancy in common that is created. Also, because the langage is again ambiguopus and the exact percentages are not in the deed, we can assume because Brock gave him money for half the business and half of the warehouse site, and the use of the phrase ""jointly,"" they most likely have a 50/50 interest as tenants in common of the property. Due to their 50/50 stake as tenants in common, Brock has two options that the court would likely deicde between: a partition in kind or a partition in sale. A partition in kind is when the court splits the property by its value and give the respective fair percentage to each owner. A partition is sale is when the court will order the property to be sold and the profits from the sale will be split according to the percentage interest of the respective owners. For this to happen, a court must find that the property is unique in some way that would make it difficult to equally split the land by partition in kind, and that it would at least benefit one owner, and not prejudice any of the owners. Courts typically like to apply partition in kind, but this can sometimes be difficult when one part of the land is more valuable than another. As seen in Delfino v. Valencis, partitions in sale can sometimes be favorable, however, if an owner has a particular emotional attatchment to the land then this could potentially create an unfair prejudice against that owner. interest of the respective owners. For this to happen, a court must find that the property is unique in some way that would make it difficult to equally split the land by partition in kind, and that it would at least benefit one owner, and not prejudice any of the owners.

Valencis, partitions in sale can sometimes be favorable, however, if an owner has a particular emotional attatchment to the land then this could potentially create an unfair prejudice against that owner. In this case, if the developer is willing to purchase part of the land, then a partition in kind may be the most viable option for brock and his brother. This could allow Alex to keep his warehouse and brock to take some/all of the other 10 acres of land and sell it to the developer. However, if the developer wants the whole property, including the warehouse, or he will not buy it, then Brock's best hope is to talk to Alex again and see if he would be open to selling the property. That seems unlikely, given their heated discusssion. Thus, a court would likely find that a partition in sale would be unfairly prejudice towards Alex because his business is there and he has financially and emotionally invested in it. Brock may be able to offer that he's only been there since 2001, a few years, and he could easily find new property with the money and open a new brewery. A court would still likely find a partition in kind more viable, as the property seems to be able to be fairly divided and it would not unjustly harm either of the owners. 1B. Dear Carl, I write to you today to inform you of your legal rights pertaining the gold coins, your growler, and your jacket. Firstly, I will address the gold coins. As the coins appear to be dated to the 1800, we would typically assume that what you found was either mislaid or embedded property. If it is mislaid, that means the true owner placed it there with the intention to come back for it. In that case, Alex and Brock's brewery would have the best claim to the coins. If it is embedded, as seen in Corliss v. Wenner, in which the coins likely dated to the 1950s/60s, the court will again likely give ownership rights to the owner of the property in which they were found. In Corliss v. Wenner, the idaho courts did not recognized treasure trove, as they did not want to encourage trespassers to go looking on other people's property for buried items. Here, a court would likely also not recognzie treasure trove for that same reason. Also, given that the coins were wrapped in a bag from a grocery store that's earliest dating could be 10 years, these coins were likely more recently placed. It's unlikely that you would be able to argue these coins are lost property as they seemed to have been purposefully placed 8 in that hole, and thus first finder rules (the first finder has a superior right to property above all except the true owner, Amory case with the chimney sweep and the jewel) would likely not apply here. The coins are also likely not abandoned trove, as they did not want to encourage trespassers to go looking on other people's property for buried items. Here, a court would likely also not recognzie treasure trove for that same reason. Also, given that the coins were wrapped in a bag from a grocery store that's earliest dating could be 10 years, these coins were likely more recently placed. It's unlikely that you would be able to argue these coins are lost property as they seemed to have been purposefully placed in that hole, and thus first finder rules (the first finder has a superior right to property above all except the true owner, Amory case with the chimney sweep and the jewel) would likely not apply here. The coins are also likely not abandoned property, as they were carefully placed in a bag, and in a hole within the warehouse, thus you would again have no right to the coins. Secondly, I will discuss your growler. The issue at hand with the growler would be whether or not a bailment was created. As seen in Allen v. Hyatt, a bailment can occur when the owner has given up temporary possession of an item to an extent that they expect the someone else to be in charge of it. In the Allen case, a bailment was created because the hyatt hotel garage gave him a ticket, he paid a fee, there was a gaurd and secutriy, and it was an enclosed garage with only one way out. Here, you did recieve a ticket that matched the numbers on the tag of your growler. It's also reasonable that you expect the growler to be taken care of and returned properly as the reason you gave it to them is for them to fill it up with beer. Having it shattered or misplaced would defeat the purpose of handing it over. A bailment was likely created because you were given a ticket, and you have an emotional attatchment to it as it was given to you be a friend. The brewery will likely agrue that there was no bailment- their ticket system is likely for the purpose of not getting it confused with others, not to keep your growler safe. Also, a glass container in a brewery likely breaks often, as people typically have multiple growlers and the cost of such are usually fairly low. A court will probably find that the ticketing system was purposed for the brewery to keep track of which growler belonged to which customer, not to safely keep the growler and create a bailment for such. Lastly, I will discuss your jacket. It appears that your jacket could have be stolen or you misplaced it. In the event that it was stolen, the jacket would belong to you should it be found. However, in the event that you misplaced it, the brwery would have a property interests in it should it be found there. But if you go back and do find it there, you have a superior right to ownership over the brewery. However, the fact that you announced ""forget it,"" as you left, could indicate that it was abandoned property. If the court treats it as such, then whoever finds it will have superior ownership over for it over you. 1C. David is given a present posessory fee simple5subject to executory limitation. Frank and Fred thus have an executory interest in fee simple. Thus, when David decides to stop using the property for residential use only, Frank and Fred's interest should vest and they will take the property from David. that you misplaced it, the brwery would have a property interests in it should it be found there. But if you go back and do find it there, you have a superior right to ownership over the brewery. However, the fact that you announced ""forget it,"" as you left, could indicate that it was abandoned property. the If court treats it as such, then whoever finds it will have superior ownership over for it over you. 1C. David is given a present posessory fee simple subject to executory limitation. Frank and Fred thus have an executory interest in fee simple. Thus, when David decides to stop using the property for residential use only, Frank and Fred's interest should vest and they will take the property from David. Edward has what sounds like a fee simple determinable, given the durational language of ""so long as,"" and thus Alex would have a possibility of reverter in fee simple. However, Alex's language in the deed states that he shall have the ""right to re-enter and reclaim the premises,"" which would indicate he intended to give Edward a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. If the court decides that it is a fee simple determinable, the second Edward begins selling IPAs he would go against the deed and it would immideatly go to Alex, who had the possibility of reverter in fee simple. If the court decides it was a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, then Alex would only have the right of re-entry and thus would need to file an action against David in order to get the property back. Courts typically will rule in favor of a fee simple subject to condition subsequent if the language is ambigious, as it is more likely to give property owner a better change at keeping the property. Here, a court would likely uphold a fee simple subject to condition subsequent given their prefrance, and the deed creator (alex) intention by using the words right to re-enter in the deed. "," Andrew and Betty have an tenancy by entirety, which means that they equally own all their property. Because they never divorce, this does not change. When Andrew and sold Greenacre to Chris, he did so without the permission of Betty, who had an equal stake of ownership in the property. Because Andrew did not have full ownership of the property, it was not his to sell without the persmission of betty. This would liekly mean that in 2019, Betty has the superior title to Greenacre. However, as Chris bought the land in 2001, there is a case for Adverse Possession here. In order for someone to adeversly possess a property the must fulfill the following requirement: 1. Hostile: Use the property without the permission of the owner. some courts reuire a good faith possession (thought it was theirs but mistaken) others require a bad faith (they are trying to have a superior title over the true owner) and others apply an objective standard (do not look into the mind of the adverse possessor) 2. Actual: they must be using it as an actual owner would 3. Continuous: using it continuously as an true owner would. 4. Notorious: using it is such a manner that would put the true owner on notice (Marango cave, Manillo v. Gorski) 5. Exclusive: limiting the use of others, using it in an exclusive manner. They someone to adeversly possess a property the must fulfill the following requirement: 1. Hostile: Use the property without the permission of the owner. some courts reuire a good faith possession (thought it was theirs but mistaken) others require a bad faith (they are trying to have a superior title over the true owner) and others apply an objective standard (do not look into the mind of the adverse possessor) 2. Actual: they must be using it as an actual owner would 3. Continuous: using it continuously as an true owner would. 4. Notorious: using it is such a manner that would put the true owner on notice (Marango cave, Manillo v. Gorski) 5. Exclusive: limiting the use of others, using it in an exclusive manner. They must also meet the statutory time limit for adverse possession to apply. Applying the requirements of adverse possession on part of Chris and Debbie: 1. Hostile: Chris technically had the persmission of Andrew, but andrew was not the only owner, and thus did not have permission from debbie, so his use of Greenacre would be hostile. 2. Actual: chris was there using the property, and now debbie uses the house. Betty may argue that she only uses the house and the two acres it is on, and thus is not actually using the entire property. A court may only grant the portion of the land that chris and debbie actually used, not the entire 50 acres. 3. Continuous: chris and debbie seemingly used it continuously, and as typical owners would by coming and going as they pleased, chris may have only used it a few months of the year, but this is typical for people who have summer or seasonal houses. 4. Notorious: chris enlarged the small cabin on the peroperty, and debbie lived in the house and cleared trees and made a garden. This use would be enough to put a true owner on notice. If Betty ever visited the property, she would have seen that improvements/changes were being made despite her thinking that no one lived there. 5. Exclusive: here it seems that chris and debbie did still use the property exclusively. Although they allowed neighbors to hunt and fish on the land, they still had limitations, as when chris was using the property, or as debbie did not allow them to used the 2 acres around her home. This would indicate exclusivity. Betty may be able to argue that allowing the neighbors to use the property for hunting, to be used when Chris wasn't there, and debbie's allowance for them to use most of the property whenever they want except 2 acres, would indicate that it is not exclusive. This is likely a losing argument, as it is reasonable for an owner to allow neighbors to use portions of their land, and chris and debbie still maintined restrictions on that use. Also, a court would recognize that both Chris and Debbie had a good faith possession of the property, as they did believe it was theirs but was mistaken. Given the juridiction, they make recognize that if they require good faith. As far as the satute of limitation for the time one needs to adversly possess, 2001- 2019 is a considerable amount of time and most jurisdictions require somewhere between 5-30 years, so their possession would most likely qualify under the limitations. Also, because Chris left greenacre to Debbie, they were in privity so the years chris spent adversly possessing could likely be tacked on to recognize that both Chris and Debbie had a good faith possession of the property, as they did believe it was theirs but was mistaken. Given the juridiction, they make recognize that if they require good faith. As far as the satute of limitation for the time one needs to adversly possess, 2001- 2019 is a considerable amount of time and most jurisdictions require somewhere between 5-30 years, so their possession would most likely qualify under the limitations. Also, because Chris left greenacre to Debbie, they were in privity so the years chris spent adversly possessing could likely be tacked on to Debbie's years of use. In conclusion, a court would likely find that Betty is true owner of Greenacre, as she had a tenancy by entirety and never gave permission to her husband to sell the property. However, it appears that Chris and Debbie fulfilled the AP requirements and likely would have ownership of the property. ",535,1869,971
341a81d8-db2d-4017-95ca-f11d39c62331," BROCK'S CASE UNDER PARTITION: First we will look at the grant by Oliver to his first child to retire; either Connor or Carla. Both of his children have [Contingent remainder in life estate]. When one of them meets the condition, they obtain the property for their life. Contingent remainder is subject to RAP. There the rule is valid because the grantor is alive, and life in being is still active, plus the 21 years if the grantor dies. Second, we will look at the interest of newphew Robert, who have a [Vested remainder in life estate]. Robert does not have to do anything to obtain his interest, and therefore he will wait for his interest to vest. Vested remainder is not subject to the RAP. Finally, we look at the grandchildren's interest, and we will start by looking at Victor's who have a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple absolute. His interest is subject to open because he will be sharing his interest with more of his relatives to come. His interest is subject to the RAP. The rule will be valid becaues his interest is subject to life in being of the nephew who is still alive. However, Villian who is 17, have a contingent remainder in fee simple absolute, in which he/she have to meet the condition of being 25 in order to obtain their right of interest. Villian interest is subject to the RAP. It is also valid, because she can use her own age to measure the life in being. "," First issue we need to discuss is whether Brock's interest under tenants in common could be partitioned by his brother (a likely step for his brother to do to get out of both of their interest), and what is his defense. In order for us to discuss this issue, we need to label Brock's right in the property. Brock's have half of the property in common tenant, which means that Brock and his brother have an equal share in which Part III: Essay Question First issue we need to discuss is whether Brock's interest under tenants in common could be partitioned by his brother (a likely step for his brother to do to get out of both of their interest), and what is his defense. In order for us to discuss this issue, we need to label Brock's right in the property. Brock's have half of the property in common tenant, which means that Brock and his brother have an equal share in which both have the right to use and enjoy of the full property. His brother wrote that they both have a teneant in common, which automaticlly gives both brothers fair use and possession of the land. His brother Alex could go to court and seek a partition by sale, in which this would favor him because he would let the broker buy it for a good amount of money. His brother is very tired of the selling beer and want out, therefore, he wants to sell the property and obtain the money. What is each side argument? Before we start, we need to understand the rule from Delfino case, in which one party wanted to sell the property where one party wanted to buy out the other party, or sell the property in the market at a reasonable price. However, the court ruled that in order to file for partition by sale, the property must be so hard to divide evenly between parties, and the sale of the party is beneficial to both parties. Brocks Argument: Brock's argument could be that the property could be divided, and therefore his brother's filing for partition by sale wouldn't work. He could argue that the property is made up evenly, and that everything in the party is setup evenly in which everything could be split between parties fair and square. In addition, he could argue that the partition by sale will not benefit him because even though there is a lot of money involved, his attachement to the property has a greater value. In Delfino case, the rule reasoned that the attachement that was held by the defendant needs to be a great consideration. The defendant had a great attachment to the property [benefcial] because of her family's history and therefore, the court had to put that into consideration. Brock could argue that even though his parents are not there, it had always been his dream to own a local brewlerly, and after hard work and effort he finally fullfilled his dream, and this is why this property have became of a great value to him emotionally. In addition, the brother could argue that he now have a possession of the land, because he did oust his brother out of the property when he told him ""now get out of here and don't come back."" His brother responded and just left, which led to him having a hostile use of the property. In this case, the court will likely side with Brock, 4espcially if the property is capable of being split evenly. The court would likely decline the partition by sale because of the close attachement that Brock have had to the property. This means that the benefit of the party will not be much to him if he's lossing finally fullfilled his dream, and this is why this property have became of a great value to him emotionally. In addition, the brother could argue that he now have a possession of the land, because he did oust his brother out of the property when he told him ""now get out of here and don't come back."" His brother responded and just left, which led to him having a hostile use of the property. In this case, the court will likely side with Brock, espcially if the property is capable of being split evenly. The court would likely decline the partition by sale because of the close attachement that Brock have had to the property. This means that the benefit of the party will not be much to him if he's lossing the emotional value that he have in this property. Alex Argument: Alex can file a partition by sale because he thinks that there is no way to divide the property and it is of a great benefit of both parties. Alex would say they share the bar and everything around the property, and it is almost impossible to tell which party owns what because they have them all shared. In addition, Alex can also claim that the profit that they will be getting is even better than that was giving in Delfino case, and in this case there is an offer that is way more than the property is worth. This would be very benefcial to both parties. Both parties will be winner, and his brother Brock can use the money to buy a new warehouse and make even better money. Furthermore, Alex would argue that in Delfino case, the attachement was because of her long term memories in which the defedant have possessed the land for generations, and the the defendant have had the property for years. But in this case, Brock have had it only for a few years and it does not have the same amount of connection to him. In addition, the benefits from the sale for the community from being able to obtain condos is greater than having a beer warhouse, which could be moved to any other near location. Therefore, the court should give partition because the property can't be divided, and in doing so they will benefit both parties. Alex have a strong argument, but the court will probably side with his brother Brock because the court does not put too much value into societal benefits or the benefits obtained just by one party. The court in Delfino case have put a great emphasis on the importance of weighing the value of the property on both parties perspective, and therefore in this case Brock have a strong argument why the sale won't benefit his interest. CARL'S and Brock CASE UNDER FINDER5LAW: First, we need to identify the finder law. According to many courts ruling, the courts have stated that the both parties perspective, and therefore in this case Brock have a strong argument why the sale won't benefit his interest. CARL'S and Brock CASE UNDER FINDER LAW: First, we need to identify the finder law. According to many courts ruling, the courts have stated that the finder rule under these circumstances apply: Mislaid: To the owner of the property, and property owner have right against all except for the rightful owner. Lost: Finder have the right to the item against all accept the rightful owner. Treasures: Property owner have the right of that property against all, except the rightful owner. In this case, Carl have found the gold coin, and the question is whether Carl have the right to the gold coin under the finder law against Brock. Carl argument: Carl would argue that the he found the gold coin, and therefore the gold coin belonged to him. He would claim that the coin that was found was not like the previous cases in which the guys dug a hole while being employed, but in his case he was a customer and had access to the property in which people lose stuff in floor all time. He would say that the item was not burried underground, and the fact that it was inside the hole and visible means that someone lost it. Under the finder law, a lost property is for the person who first find it against all others except the rightful owner. The only person here who have a property right for this coin is the the previous owners of this shop because the coin have their name on it. He would argue that Brock have no right of this coin because he found a lost item. The court would likely argee with Carl because the coin was not mislaid where it was placed in a place with an expectation to later to return to it. But instead, it seemed like it was lost and exposed to the public, and under this rule it is a finder against all execept the main owner. Furthermore, Carl would file a suit against the bartender who have taken a valuable item from him (his growler) and ask the court to give him the value of his growler. With this, Carl will ask the court to rule the same way the court ruled for the boy who found the lost ring and the diamond on the ring was taken The court would likely argee with Carl because the coin was not mislaid where it was placed in a place with an expectation to later to return to it. But instead, it seemed like it was lost and exposed to the public, and under this rule it is a finder against all execept the main owner. Furthermore, Carl would file a suit against the bartender who have taken a valuable item from him (his growler) and ask the court to give him the value of his growler. With this, Carl will ask the court to rule the same way the court ruled for the boy who found the lost ring and the diamond on the ring was taken by the shop, in which the court ordered the store owner to pay the max price a diamond is worth to the boy. Carl would argue that the growler had a very sentimental value and there is no other that could be the same as that growler, and therefore he should be compensated for the most valuable growler out their due to it's great value. Brock Argument: Brock would argue that coin was mislaid in his property. He would argue that the first owners have placed it there and have forgotten to take it. He would also say that this is considered a hidden treasure, because it was inside a hole that has been there for a long time, and it is not noticable by anyone, therefore it belongs to the property owner. He would argue that even Carl is just a customer, he was giving a persmission to tresspass just like the workers in cases that courts have ruled, that being a worker does not change the fact that whatever is found in the property belongs to the owner of the property, unless first owner comes back and retrieve it. In this case, the owner of the property is Brock and his brother, and the finding the gold coin should be given to them. Brock will ask the court to make Carl pay the full amount of any given coin, because he took the coin and hid it in which no one knows the real value of that coin. Just like the boy with the ring that went to the shop, because the diamond was hidden and we cannot find it's real value due to the shop owner stealing it, he should be compensated for the most expensive coin out there. Estates in Question C: First we need to look at the estates between each party. First sale, now that Alex have bought all proeprty, he have a simple fee absolute. He decided to sell 5 acres of land to real estate, in a determintal fee simple absolute subject to exectuory limitation. If David ever uses the property for resential purposes, the property will then go to Frank and Fred who have an executory interest in fee simple absolute. Now both of the children are subject to the RAP. Their interest is valid, because the life in Estates in Question C: First we need to look at the estates between each party. First sale, now that Alex have bought all proeprty, he have a simple fee absolute. He decided to sell 5 acres of land to real estate, in a determintal fee simple absolute subject to exectuory limitation. If David ever uses the property for resential purposes, the property will then go to Frank and Fred who have an executory interest in fee simple absolute. Now both of the children are subject to the RAP. Their interest is valid, because the life in being is in David who is still alive. For the second sale of the 5 acres, Edward have a simple fee subject to determinable. The RAP does not apply here because it is not subject to the rule. Alex have a power of reverter. Which means that if Edward violates the rule and starts making IPA again, Alex the property automatically goes back to Alex. Edward did start making IPA and therefore, the 5 acres that was sold to Edward, now belongs to Alex. "," Andrew and Betty: Tenants by the entirety Andrew and Betty have tenants by entirety, which means that they both have equal rights and are treated as one person. Non of them can sell property without the permission of another. In this case, the sale of land to Chris was invalid. However, the question is whether Chris could obtain property through adverse posession color blind. The color blind under adverse possession allows a person who obtained a property through a forged sale to obtain all land within that sale if they meet the adverse possession requirement. The requirement for adverse possesion is the following elements: The possession must be Open/Nortorious, Continues, Actual, Hostile, and exclusive. In addition, they must meet the statutory period of possession. There is also an allowance under Tieu case ruling, which allows a person to tackle the a year of possesion to another person if the property was transfer through a conveyance or a gift. In this case, Chris did not violated the rule during his time of posession and he had nothing to transfer to his daughter Debbie. When he possessed the land, he did not meet the following requirements: Actual: He did not actually possess because he was not there in the property. However, he could argue that he was there just like any normal owner would be, just for the benefits of fishing and hunting of the 10 property. However, because he was only there for8 aofshort time, it probably wont satisfy the rule that he was there all time. In this case, Chris did not violated the rule during his time of posession and he had nothing to transfer to his daughter Debbie. When he possessed the land, he did not meet the following requirements: Actual: He did not actually possess because he was not there in the property. However, he could argue that he was there just like any normal owner would be, just for the benefits of fishing and hunting of the property. However, because he was only there for a short time, it probably wont satisfy the rule that he was there all time. Continues: He only stayed for two weeks, and the person must treat the property like any reasonable person would by conducting the daily normal owner activity. He could argue that he did go there to fish yearly for 8 years, which is what a reasonable person would do on the usuage of the other party. However, the court would likely require a continues use more than just a vacation shown. Open/Nortorious: The rule states that the possession should be in a way that a reasonable person who owns the property passing by should be able to know that the party have been possess. In this case, Chris was never at the property to begin with, and therefore he can't show that the property was open and nortorious. He could argue that he was present in the seasonal fishing, that is the time when the owner would likely be there. But him fishing and being present does not tell anyone that he is there to actually possess. Hostile: In a hostile posession, the owner needs to take the property at least without permission of the owner. In this case, Chris could argue that he did tresspass and take possession of the land for 8 years and did not ask or get permission from anyone. However, because the pond was open to the neighbors, and everyone had access to pond, it did not show that he was hostile against all. Exclusive: Under this element, the owner needs to have the property for himself only, excluding all strangers, including the real property owner. The owner can argue that he had possession of the property and he have given permission to the neighbors to hunt and fish on the land and therefore, it is still exclusive. However, a lot of other people could be using the property, and because the owner is not present, it is very hard to argue that his possession was exclusive. Now, to find out whether Debbie have right after her father have passed down the property, which under Tieu case, he is allowed to tack on his years of possession with his daughter, if the trasnfer was conveyed or gifted voluntarly. In this case, if she can prove that her father did have a valid adverse possessing claim, she can add in his tacked years of possession and add it to hers to years of have full possession of the property that she is posession. If she succeeds, under color blind she9will currently residing on (the two acres) and also whatever is conveyed in the sale of contract by Andrew. Now, to find out whether Debbie have right after her father have passed down the property, which under Tieu case, he is allowed to tack on his years of possession with his daughter, if the trasnfer was conveyed or gifted voluntarly. In this case, if she can prove that her father did have a valid adverse possessing claim, she can add in his tacked years of possession and add it to hers to years of posession. If she succeeds, under color blind she will have full possession of the property that she is currently residing on (the two acres) and also whatever is conveyed in the sale of contract by Andrew. Depending on the stature limitation, if the time have been met, in this case, the property was sold to Chris in 2001, if valid, and the daughter posession is also valid, that will be 18 years of possession. However, if it very unlikely that they will obtain any possession, because the daughter have obtained possession in 2011, and if the statute of limitation is 10 years, her claim will fail. However, if her possession meets the five elements, and the statute of limitation is 8 years or less, she will be able to claim full posession of all the property she's currently posessing and all that conveyd in the contract of sale to her dad under the color blind contract.

d2054499-4dd2-4ea1-9dae-7751c37f58e5," First, we must identify all future interests and present estates described in Oliver Owner's grant. Since Oliver (grantor) is alive at the time of the grant, this is a conveyance inter vivos, meaning that the coneyance is between living parties. Olivor conveyed a life estate to the first of his children to retire. At the present moment, we do not know which of his children (Connor, Carla, or any future children of Oliver unascertained at the time of the grant). Since we do not know which of Oliver's children will retire first, both Connor and Carla, as well as any unascertained children of Oliver, all have a contingent remainder in a life estate. Robert, Oliver's nephew, has a vested remainder in a life estate that will not convey until the first of Connor's children to retire dies, or none of his children retire prior to their deaths. Oliver's grandchild Victor, who is 26 and has already met the condition that he reach the age of 25 as stated in the grant, has a vested remainder in fee simple subject to partial divestment. Vivian, the other ascertained grandchild of Oliver at the time of conveyance, has an executory interest in fee simple, as she has yet to reach the age of 25 as required in the grant. All future grandchildren of Oliver that are unascertained at the moment have an executory interest in fee simple too, because Oliver's children could still have more children (thus, Oliver having more grandchildren). Lastly, Oliver has a reversion in fee simple. The common law Rule against Perpetuities (""RAP"") requires that there must be a vested interest, there must be an actual interest/title that is being conveyed, and that there must be at least one validating life at the time of the conveyance. Further, the RAP only applies to interests that involve contingent remainders, vested remainders subject to open, and executory interests. First,we must look at the initial contingent remainder in a life estate conveyed to the first of Oliver's children to retire. Since this grant was conveyed inter vivos, the clock starts ticking for the RAP stature of limitations immediately at conveyance. That would mean that the first of Oliver's children must retire within 21 years or else the interest will void. Since we can conceivably imagine a scenarior where Oliver's children were to work until they were 90 years old, thus choosing to never retire, the RAP would void this interest because retirement would not occur for far beyond the 21 2years pursuant to the statute. Next, we must look at the vested remainder in a life estate conveyed to Robert. Since Robert's interest was conveyed inter vivos, the clock starts ticking for the RAP stature of limitations immediately at conveyance. That would mean that the first of Oliver's children must retire within 21 years or else the interest will void. Since we can conceivably imagine a scenarior where Oliver's children were to work until they were 90 years old, thus choosing to never retire, the RAP would void this interest because retirement would not occur for far beyond the 21 years pursuant to the statute. Next, we must look at the vested remainder in a life estate conveyed to Robert. Since Robert's interest is vested and not open to any other person, the class is closed. Robert's interest does not apply to the RAP and thus is valid. Next, we must look at the interest of Victor, who is 26 and has already met the condition that he reach the age of 25 as stated in the grant, and who has a vested remainder in fee simple subject to partial divestment. Victor's interest does not apply to the RAP and thus is valid. Next, we must look at the Vivian's interest who has an executory interest in fee simple, as she has yet to reach the age of 25 as required in the grant. Vivian is a validating life, as she is alive at the the time of conveyance of the grant. Her interest will absolutely vest (reach 25) or fail (die prior to 25) within the 21 year time period under the RAP, as she is 17 and we only need 8 years to definitively determine that she will or will not reach 25 and have her interest vest. Vivian's interest is valid under the RAP. Lastly, we must look at the interest of any unascertained grandchild born after the conveyance of the grant. Any of Robert's grandchildren born after the conveyance of the grant will not reach the age of 25 prior to the end of the 21 year statute of limitaitons requirement under the RAP. Therefore, any of these unascertained grandchildren's interests will void under the RAP. However, a court could apply the Rule of Convenience. Under the RAP, Oliver's unascertained grandchildren's interest would void, despite Victor already meeting the condition required in the grant that he must reach the age of 25. The Rule of Convenience, however, could be applied by the court to close the class of Oliver's grandchildren, and convey to both Victor (whose interest is already vested) and any other grandchildren born after the conveyance of the grant but within the 21 years of the statute of limitations period, allowing for all grandchildren alive at the time the court closes the class to have their interest conveyed. Thus, a court would like re-write the language of the grant to read: Oliver Owner grants his property to his nephew Robert for life, then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25. 2) "," 1a. The issue is whether or not Brock can make money from the brewery as a tenant in common with Alex. As a tenant in common, Brock has a 1/2 interest in the brewery/warehouse property and is entitled to receiveing equal shares in revenue. Alex would argue that he kicked Brock out of the company and the property as a tenant in common and does not have to pay Brock. Brock would argue that he never severed his tenancy in common and legally deserves 1/2 revenue of the revenue receieved from the business that Brock legally acquired 1/2 possession of from Alex. Further, Brock would argue that Alex ousted him from his property and that Brock needs to put Alex on notice that he must pay him for half of all the proceeds made from the business despite Brock not being present on the land. A court would agree with Brock, that he never severed his tenancy in common with Alex and that Brock is entitled to 1/ all revenue from the buisness. Further, a court would claim that Brock was ousted, and that b/c Brock was ousted, if he were not paying for any of the carrying charges, necessary repairs, or improvements while Alex refused to pay him, that the necesary money received in partition by the court shall be given back to Alex only for the necessary payments as a tenant in common, and that the remaining surplus value awarded in partition be given to Brock. Further, if Brock wanted too, he as a tenant in common, Brock could ask the court to partition in kind the land (physically divide it according to each parties interest), so in this case split the land in half and give both Alex and Brock one side of the land. Or, Brock could ask the court to issue a partition in sale, meaning that the entirety of the land be put up for sale and that Brock and Alex can split the purchase price in half. Accoridng to Delfino, courts prefer to partition in kind when possible, and only will parition in sale if the land is unfeasibly able to be physically divided accurately, and if it benefits all of the parties to partition by sale. In this case, Alex would argue his business will be lost if there were a partition in kind, becuase it would shrink his business physically in half. Further, Alex would argue that a partition in sale would damage hsi business because someone could purchase the land (pay way more than Alex could for the sale) and then quash Alex' business entirely. Brock would argue that a partition the land back. A court would argue that since in sale is best for all becuase Alex could then just 4buy there's only 2 tenants in common, it makes more sense to avoid partition in general and to have Alex buy out Brock at a market level value. If the court were to choose between partition in kind or partition the parties to partition by sale. In this case, Alex would argue his business will be lost if there were a partition in kind, becuase it would shrink his business physically in half. Further, Alex would argue that a partition in sale would damage hsi business because someone could purchase the land (pay way more than Alex could for the sale) and then quash Alex' business entirely.

A court would argue that since there's only 2 tenants in common, it makes more sense to avoid partition in general and to have Alex buy out Brock at a market level value. If the court were to choose between partition in kind or partition in sale, a court would choose in kind becuase they prefer not to leave the chance for a third party purchaser to come and wipe out someone's business currently operating on the land. 1b. Dear Carl, The issue we need to discuss is whether or not you have acquired possession of the gold coins. Finder's law, as determined in Pimental, determines property into categories as one of lost property, mislaid property, treasure trove, embedded property, or abandoned property. If the gold coins were considered lost, you would have absolute title to the gold coins over everyone in the world except for the rightful owner. Lost property, as defined in Armory and shown in Clark, must be unintentionally placed and the owner is unaware of its whereabouts. Since you had found the coins in a very small hole aftr seeing a reflection of light off of the coins once you were knocked down onto the floor, and it you had to really squeeze your finger in to pull the coins out, the coins seemed strategically placed by the owner. Since the coins seems strategically placed, it's fair to assume that the owner had an intention of placing the coins in this exact location. We must decide whether these coins were mislaid, meaning the property was left there intentionally by the owner and just forgotten or if the coins were treasure trove, meaning the coins were left there intentionally by the owner for a long period of time with the intent to return and repossesses the coins. Since the coins had the grocery store's name which opened only 10 years ago, the best claim to the coins is that they were mislaid property. Unfortunately, since mislaid property was unintentional and the owner knows of its whereabouts and would likely return to repossess the coins, the mislaid property does not create possession in the finder (you), instead creating possession in the owner of the property where you had found the coins (the brewery). According to the McAvoy case possession of mislaid property creates absolute title in the property owner where the coins were found that is superior to the property over everyone in the world besides the true owner of the coins. Thus, a court would likly conclude that the brewery has rightful possession to the coins over anyone but the true the best claim to the coins is that they were mislaid property. Unfortunately, since mislaid property was unintentional and the owner knows of its whereabouts and would likely return to repossess the coins, the the mislaid property does not create possession in the finder (you), instead creating possession in owner of the property where you had found the coins (the brewery).

Additionally, regarding your growler and coat, 1c. "," New Suffolk: A/P claims must be brought within 10 years after the cause of action thereof accrued...but if a person entitled to bring such an action (or anyone claiming under that person) gets 7 years after such disability is removed. 2. The issue is whether or not Chris/Debbie have adversely possessed (""A/P"") Greenacre from Betty. First, we must look at the statute of limitations, which under New Suffolk's statute governing A/P requires that A/P claims must be brought within 10 years after the cause of action thereof accrued...but if a person entitled to bring such an action (or anyone claiming under that person) gets 7 years after such disability is removed.

Since neither Andrew or Betty have a disability consistent with the statute, a court would likely claim that Betty does not have a disability argument and that the A/P cause of action thereof accrued in 2001 when Andrew conveyed the land to Chris. Since Betty has not brought a claim for A/P of Greenacre by Chris/Debbie until 2019, 18 years have passed and the statute of limitations (""SoL"") period has passed. Next, Betty would argue that when Andrew forged Betty's name on the conveyance of Greenacre to Chris, the conveyance was fraudulent. Further, Betty would argue that as a Tenant by the Entirety, Andrew cannot unilaterally make decisions over the land without her consent. Betty would argue that at the very least, Andrew's conveyance to Chris severed Andrew's title to Greenacre, however, it did not sever Betty's title and thus that would leave Betty and Chris as tenants in common. Chris, however, would argue that he acquired the property in good faith, and had no reasonable expectation to believe that Andrew did not communcate with Betty and that Betty did not sign the conveyance herself. Further, Chris would argue that the conveyance was done in good faith, and that he has color of title to the land. A court would likely rule that Chris believed, in good faith, that he was legally acquiring the title to Greenacre from both Andrew and Betty and that his title, although not absolutely in Chris' possession, was valid. Further, a court would likely agree with Betty that she was now a tenant in common with Chris, however, (as I will point to in the ensuing paragraphs), Betty made no effort to possess Greenacre and would have realized had she did make an effort to visit the land that Chris was present. Since Betty essentially abandoned the land, a court will likely rule that despite the fraudueltn conveyance, Chris acquired color of title in Greenacre, and Chris/Debby acquired through A/P all 50 acres of the land despite only using 2 acres as that is what the conveyance led them to believe they had acquired. Next, Betty would argue that when Chris had died in 2009, the SoL's period of 10 years was not met, as Chris would only have A/P the land for 8 years. Debbie, however, would argue that when Chris died, he legally and voluntarily conveyed his land to her which would allow for Betty to tack on Chris' A/P of Greenacre. Thus, a court would likely rule that Chris' 8 years of A/P of Greenacre, couple with Debbies's 10 years of A/P of Greenacre would satisify the SoLs. they had acquired. Next, Betty would argue that when Chris had died in 2009, the SoL's period of 10 years was not met, as Chris would only have A/P the land for 8 years. Debbie, however, would argue that when Chris died, he legally and voluntarily conveyed his land to her which would allow for Betty to tack on Chris' A/P of Greenacre. Thus, a court would likely rule that Chris' 8 years of A/P of Greenacre, couple with Debbies's 10 years of A/P of Greenacre would satisify the SoLs. With the SoL's satisfied, the issue is whether or not Chris/Debbie adversely possessed Greenacre. In order to satisfy an A/P claim, the adverse possessor must show continuous use of the land, hostile possession of the land, actual possession of the land, notorious and open use of the land, and exclusive use of the land. First, Betty would argue that Debbie did not continuously use the land because when Chris was alive, he did not live there full-time and therefore did not continuously use the land. Continuous, however, as seen in Morrow, can be seasonal so long as the actions constitute that of a reasonable owner of that land would. Debbie would argue that Chris's use of the land was seasonal, when to hunt and have weekend getaways. A court would agree that Chris continuously used the land while alive, and so had Debbie as she had moved there full-time in 2011. Next, Betty would argue that Chris and Debbie did not meet the hostility requirement because Betty was never put on notice by either of them that they were claiming title and A/P the land. Debbie would argue that Chris put Andrew on notice the second he signed the conveyance of Blackacre. Chris signed the conveyance under good faith, and operated thereafter as if he were the true owner of Greenacre with superior title to anyone else, as found in Tieu. Chris did not aquire the land under bad faith, like that in Dombkowski. The court's would apply an objectinve standard towards hostility, like that seen in Morrow. Unlike in Morrow where an offer letter was sent to the owner of the land (thus recognizign superior title by someone else), Chris signed the conveyance believeing he had accurate title. A court would likely rule that Chris met the hostitility argument, as well as Debbie since Debbie acquired the exact same titile, in good faith, from Chris. Further, Betty would argue that Debbie and Chris did not make actual use of Greenacre becuase Chris was not presently there. Debbie would argue that Chris was seasonaly present, to relax, hike and hunt which is enough becuase that is how a reasonable owner would use the Greenacre land. Debbie would argue that she made actual use because she moved there full-time in 2011, physically present there. A court would likely agree with Debbie that her and Chris made actual use of the land. Next, Betty would argure that Debbie and Chris did not make their use of Greenacre both notorious and exact same titile, in good faith, from Chris. Further, Betty would argue that Debbie and Chris did not make actual use of Greenacre becuase Chris was not presently there. Debbie would argue that Chris was seasonaly present, to relax, hike and hunt which is enough becuase that is how a reasonable owner would use the Greenacre land. Debbie would argue that she made actual use because she moved there full-time in 2011, physically present there. A court would likely agree with Debbie that her and Chris made actual use of the land. Next, Betty would argure that Debbie and Chris did not make their use of Greenacre both notorious and open to her becuase she was never put on notice that they were possessing the land. Debby would argue, however, that if Betty were to ever drive up to the Greenacre property that she would notice immediately that they were being notorious and open with their land. Unlike in Marengo Cave or in Gorski, where the defendants did not make their use of the land open and notorious, all it would take is for Betty to drive directly to the property to know clearly that Debbie and Chris were notorious and open with the land. A court would likely agree with Debbie's argument. Lastly, Betty would argue that Debbie and Chris did not make exclusive use of the land becuase she did not exclude others from the land. Debbie would counter, however, and argue that anyone of her friends that wanted to come to Greenacre to hunt were allowed to by Chris when he was alive, and by Debbie becuase she gave them explicit permission to hunt but not to come onto her two acres of land that she lives on full-time with her expressed permission. A court would likely agree with Debbie that her and Chris made exclusive use of the land by giving permission to friends to hunt but not to come onto their two acres specified. Thus, a court would likely conclude that Chris acquired the title in good-faith from Andrew, and that through color of title, Chris and debbie adversely possessed the land for more than the 10 years required by the statute in New Suffolk, and that Chris and Debbie met the necessary elements of A/P to satisify the claim. Debbie would recieve absolute title to Greenacre and Betty would not have possession in any form. ",926,1163,1540
6e472a30-2be4-4670-bff5-0a78a5fab822," The main issue here is whether the rule against perpetuities applies to the grant. The sub issue is whether Connor and Carla or Victor and Vivian's interets violate the rule against perpetuities. The rule against perpetuities is important because it limits deadhand control and without it grantor's would be able to restrain their property far into the future. At the time of the grant, Oliver's estate has a fee simple subject to executory limitation and Connor and Carla have springing executory interests in life estate. Connor and Carla's springing executory interest is subject to the rule against perpetuities. Connor and Carla's interest does not violate the rule against perpetuities because they are both relevant measuring lives in being at the time of the grant and upon their death their interests will vest or vail depending on if they retire or not. Thus, Connor and Carla's springing executory interests are valid under the rule against perpetuities. Next, if Oliver did not have any grandchildren at the time of the grant, the interest created in Oliver's grandchildren who reach the age of 25 would be a contingent remainder. This interest would otherwise be invalid under the rule against perpetuities, but the rule of convenience allows otherwise invalid interests under the rule against perpetuities to be valid if the interest can vest in someone alive at the time of the grant. Since Oliver's grandson Victor is 26 years old, the rule of convenience can save this interest from being invalid. As a result of the rule of convenience, Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple absolute and Vivian has an executory interest in fee simple absolute until she reaches the age of 25. If Oliver has any other grandchildren alive at the time, they will have the same interests as Vivian until they reach the age of 25, but if any grandchild of Oliver is born after the grant then they can never become part of the class and they are out of luck. Thus, after applying the rule of convenience, the interests are as follows: Oliver's estate has a present possessory fee simple subject to executory limitation, Connor and Carla have a springing executory interest in life estate, Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple absolute, and Vivian has an executory interest in fee simple absolute until she reaches the age of 25. Thus, after applying the rule of convenience, the interests are as follows: Oliver's estate has a present possessory fee simple subject to executory limitation, Connor and Carla have a springing executory interest in life estate, Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple absolute, and Vivian has an executory interest in fee simple absolute until she reaches the age of 25. "," 1a: Brock, the deed your brother created after you paid him for half of the business and warehouse site made you both tenants in common. Although the word ""jointly"" is used in the deed, most courts would require more specifc language to create a joint tenancy. As tenants in common, both you and Alex have a seperate fractional financial interest, but a complete and undivided right to possess the whole. Alex's use of the word ""jointly"" and your payment for half of the business and warehouse means that you both have a 1/2 financial interest in the property. It does not seem that Alex has fully ousted you yet. Ouster means that you have tried to enter the property and another tenant has denied you entry. Alex did not tell you to leave until you expressed your interest in selling. You may want to try to go back again and see if he will talk to you about selling or let you in. If you go back and he denies you entry, then you have been ousted and we can discuss partition as your next step. Since the issue between you and Alex over selling the property seems unlikely to be resolved, your next step would be partition. The issue here is whether a partition in kind or a partition in sale would make more sense. Courts generally prefer partitions in kind to partions in sale. In Delfino v. Valencias, the court reasoned that in order to partition by sale, the court would have to find that a partition in kind is not possible or unreasonable due to the nature of the property and that a partition by sale is in the best interest of all of the tenants. While you would likely benefit the most financially from a partition by sale, the court will not likely grant one. Alex will argue for a partition in kind because the property is 10 acres and, if the structures are only on 5 acres (as question 1c suggests they are), it could be split in half with both of you receiving 5 acres each. Alex will likely want the 5 acres with the 5 acres and an additional owelty payment as structures and, as a result, you could recieve the other compensation for Alex's parcel with the structures having more value. This would likely be a good result because you could still receieve a substantial amount of money by selling your 5 acres to the developer. sale is in the best interest of all of the tenants. While you would likely benefit the most financially from a partition by sale, the court will not likely grant one. Alex will argue for a partition in kind because the property is 10 acres and, if the structures are only on 5 acres (as question 1c suggests they are), it could be split in half with both of you receiving 5 acres each. Alex will likely want the 5 acres with the structures and, as a result, you could recieve the other 5 acres and an additional owelty payment as compensation for Alex's parcel with the structures having more value. This would likely be a good result because you could still receieve a substantial amount of money by selling your 5 acres to the developer. However, if the structures take up all 10 acres, you will have a good arguement that a partition in kind is not possible and unreasonable due to the structures on the property because you cannot split the structures down the middle. Regardless of the factor of whether a partion in kind is possible or reasonable for the property, the courts will likely not grant a partition in sale in the case because Alex has a good arguement for proving his connection to the property. Alex will argue that, like the long-term tenant in Delfino v. Valencias who had a substantial emotional connection to the property itself from living there so long, he dreamed about owning his own brewery since when he was a brewery apprentice and it is not only the financial interest that attaches him to the property, but that this was his very first brewery! As a result, I think our next steps should be that you get back to me about the nature of the property and how much acreage the building sits on because that could change the outcome and both your and Alex's arguements for partition. Also, I recommend you try going back to talk to Alex again because maybe he has cooled down since you last brought up the sale. However, if he turns you away, you have been ousted and you should bring a partition action. 1b: Dear Carl, It was great meeting with you. I will first explain to you my advice about the coins, then your growler mug, and then your coat. First, since possession is prima facie evidence of ownership, you will have to prove your superior claim to the coins over the owners of the brewery, Alex and Brock. The outcome of this case will turn on whether the courts of Bostonia in New Suffolk use the treasure trove or embededd property categroy of found property. For treasure troves, the finder gains a superior claim against everyone else except for the true owner (who is likely dead). Corliss v. Wenner created the category of embedded property where the finder gains no claim and instead the owner of the premises where the property was found gains a superior claim against everyone except the true owner. The court reasoned that the treasure trove category increased trespass because it rewarded the finder rather than have to prove your superior claim to the coins over the owners of the brewery, Alex and Brock. The outcome of this case will turn on whether the courts of Bostonia in New Suffolk use the treasure trove or embededd property categroy of found property. For treasure troves, the finder gains a superior claim against everyone else except for the true owner (who is likely dead). Corliss v. Wenner created the category of embedded property where the finder gains no claim and instead the owner of the premises where the property was found gains a superior claim against everyone except the true owner. The court reasoned that the treasure trove category increased trespass because it rewarded the finder rather than the landowner and instead created the category of embedded property to prevent this. The evidence shows that these coins were not lost because they were in a grocery bag which evidences voluntary placement of the coins in the bag by the true owner. The fact that the coins were hidden deep within a small hole so much so that you had to squeeze your fingers through also shows that they were not involuntarily placed there. Moreover, the owner of the grocery store will likely be questioned about the coins, but likely has no claim because anyone could have possessed one of these grocery bags and just because they are in the grocery store's bag does not mean the grocery store owner was a prior possessor/finder. You could argue that you found a treasure trove because the coins were buried within the property so much so that you had to squeeze your fingers into the tiny hole to discover them. However, Alex and Brock will argue that the property was embedded because it was on their property and they have a superior claim. You could argue against Alex and Brock's ownership because the facts show that you found the coins in 2005, that the grocery store has been open since 1995 and Alex bought the warehouse in 2000. Thus, you could argue that Alex and Brock should not have a claim because the coins could have been there since before they even owned the warehouse. The court will likely have to weigh the public policy benefit of rewarding you as the finder against the consequence that trespassesin search of treasure troves may occur more as a result. As a result, the court will likely adopt the reasoning in Corliss v. Wenner and give the coins to Alex and Brock who will have a superior claim against everyone but the true owner (who is likely dead because the coins are so old). Next, the court will likely find that an express bailment was created when you gave the brewery your growler mug. The issue here is whether the brewery acted within their duty of care as a bailee. In Allen v. Hyatt Regency, an express bailment was created when the bailor parked their car in an enclosed and attended parking garage, but the bailee acted within their duty of care when a theif stole the car. You could argue that the baliee was negligent because 5they failed to train their new employee well enough to be entrusted with your goods as a bailor. The brewery will argue that they acted within their duty of care because they were training the new employee and accidents happen. However, unlike in Allen v. Hyatt Next, the court will likely find that an express bailment was created when you gave the brewery your growler mug. The issue here is whether the brewery acted within their duty of care as a bailee. In Allen v. Hyatt Regency, an express bailment was created when the bailor parked their car in an enclosed and attended parking garage, but the bailee acted within their duty of care when a theif stole the car. You could argue that the baliee was negligent because they failed to train their new employee well enough to be entrusted with your goods as a bailor. The brewery will argue that they acted within their duty of care because they were training the new employee and accidents happen. However, unlike in Allen v. Hyatt Regency where a theif created the problem and the bailee still acted within their duty of care, here, the brewery is resposible for the actions of their employees. Thus, a court will likely find that the brewery was negligent and you will be able to recover damages for the loss of your growler mug. Finally, the court will likely find that you leaving your coat on a shared hook by the front door did not creat a bailment. The issue is whether an implied bailment was created. The brewery will argue that there was no implied bailment because there was no agreement made between you and the brewery that they would care for your coat in your absence. Thus, unless there was a coat check, the court will likely find that no implied bailment was created for your coat. In conclusion, the court will likely find that Alex and Brock have a superior claim to the coins, that the brewery was negligent with your growler mug and you can recover from them, and that you had no implied bailment with the brewery over your coat and can therefore not recover from them for it. 1c: Alex, I will first explain your conveyance to David and then your conveyance to Edward. Your conveyance to David left David with a present possessory fee simple subject to executory limitation and Frank and Fred with an executory interest in fee simple absolute. Frank and Fred's interests violate the rule against perpetuities because their interests could vest in them or their heirs more than 21 years after the death of a relevant life in being at the time of the grant. This is important because without the rule against purpetuities, you would be able to control this property far into the future and the court limits deadhand control via the rule against perpetuities. As a result, the court will remove Frank and Fred's interests and the conveyance will now read: ""To David, so long as the property is used for residential uses only."" David now has a present possessory fee simple determinable and you have a possibility of reverter. As such, when David decided to start using part of the property for commercial stores, the property automatically reverted back to you and you are the owner of those 5 acres. Your conveyance to Edward is more ambiguous. You purported to grant Edward a present possessory fee simple determinable which is typically followed by a possibility of reverter. However, deadhand control via the rule against perpetuities. As a result, the court will remove Frank and Fred's interests and the conveyance will now read: ""To David, so long as the property is used for residential uses only."" David now has a present possessory fee simple determinable and you have a possibility PROPERTY_102�1C_Infranca_FL reverter. As such, when David decided to start using part of the property for commercial stores, the property automatically reverted back to you and you are the owner of those 5 acres. Your conveyance to Edward is more ambiguous. You purported to grant Edward a present possessory fee simple determinable which is typically followed by a possibility of reverter. However, you mention a right of entry, which only follows a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. For ambiguous grants, the court looks to the rules of construction like they did for the In re Craigen and Ford v. Allen cases. First, we look for the grantor's intent outlined in the four corner's of the grant. The intent here shows that you intended to have a right of entry. Even if you intended to have a possibility of reverter, the courts have a preference for fee simple subject to condition subsequent grants over fee simple determinable grants because of the future interests that follow them. The court prefers the right of entry/power of termination that follows a fee simple subject to condition subsequent over the possibility of reverter that follows a fee simple determinable because the right of entry/power of termination requires an affirmative step by the grantor in order to come in and retake the property, whereas with the possibility of reverter the property automatically reverts back to the grantor. The Marenholz case emphasized the importance of determining the difference between a fee simple determinable and a fee simple subject to condition subsequent for this reason. The courts prefer the right of entry/power of termination because its requirement of an affirmative step by the grantor lessens the turnover of property, makes the administration of estates easier, and avoids conflict. As a result, the court will likely find that you granted Edward a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in fee simple absolute and that you retained a right of entry/power of termination. As such, because Edward has violated the condition, you may re-enter and take back the property and once you do, you will own the whole 10 acres again in fee simple absolute. "," To adversely possess another's property in New Suffolk, the statute of limitations of 10 years must toll and the claimant must be in actual, exclusive, open and notorious, continous, and hostile possession of the property throughout the statutory period. The disability defense is not relevant here because all the facts indicate that Betty was not imprisioned, under the age of minority, or of unsound mind. For a claimant to prove actual possession, the claimant must establish a physical presence on the property with an intent to use it as a true owner would. Debbie likely satisfies this arguement because she built a permanent house on the property after her father died and moved there full-time. For a claimant to prove exclusive possession, the claimant must exercise a right to exclude as a true owner would by not sharing with strangers and not share the property with the true owner. Debbie satisfies this element because she has not shared the property with Betty and, while she has let the neighbors hunt on the land, she has excluded them from the two acres surrounding the house. However, even if Debbie had allowed the neighbors inside the house, she would still satisfy this element because she really only has to exclude the true owner. For a claimant to prove open and notorious possession, the claimant must not hide their trespass from the true owner. Debbie satisfies this requirement because she has built a house, cleared trees, and built a formal garden on the property which would put a true owner on notice upon their reasonable inspection of the property. Debbie will argue here that Betty could have found her in possession years ago had she only come to the property and performed a reasonable inspection. Betty may try to argue that Debbie's acts on the property constitute affirmative/voluntary or ameliorative waste, but the court will likely reject this arguement because waste is only enforced against the life tenant for what they do to prejudice the inheritance and Debbie is not a life tenant. For a claimant to prove continuous possession, the claimant must be in possession of the property as a true owner would throughout the 10 year statutory period in New Suffolk. Debbie will likely fail this element. Debbie has only been in continuous possession of the land for 8 years since she built her full-time house in 2011. Thus, she will likely argue for Chris's time as an adverse possessor to be tacked onto hers. In order to do this, Debbie will have to show that Chris also satisfied the elements of adverse possession. Chris received Greenacre under color of title from Andrew, Betty's husband, in 2001. Chris's possession was actual because he established a physical presence on the property with the intent to treat it as a true owner would. Here, this property is treated as a vacation home so by establishing a presence as a true vacation homeowner would by insulating the cabin and using it to hunt and fish, Chris satisfies this requirement. Next, Chris's possession was exclusive because he exercised the right to exclude as a true owner would by excluding strangers and he did 11 share with the true owner, Betty. Betty may not argue that Chris's use was not exclusive because he allows friends to use the property, but this does not violate the exclusive element. Next, Chris's possession was open and notorious because he did not hide possession was actual because he established a physical presence on the property with the intent to treat it as a true owner would. Here, this property is treated as a vacation home so by establishing a presence as a true vacation homeowner would by insulating the cabin and using it to hunt and fish, Chris satisfies this requirement. Next, Chris's possession was exclusive because he exercised the right to exclude as a true owner would by excluding strangers and he did not share with the true owner, Betty. Betty may argue that Chris's use was not exclusive because he allows friends to use the property, but this does not violate the exclusive element. Next, Chris's possession was open and notorious because he did not hide his possession. For eight weeks every year he was on the property acting as a true owner would. Moreover, Chris enlarged and insulated the cabin enough so that a true owner would be put on notice upon her reasonable inspection of the property. Debbie can argue that Chris satisfies this element because, had Betty done a reasonable inspection, she would have found Chris or the improved cabin on the property just as easily as she found Debbie upon her first reasonable inspection. Chris occupied the property for 8 years and therefore does not satisfy the continuous or 10 year statutory requirement for adverse possesion in New Suffolk alone, which is why Debbie will want to tack on the 8 years Chris occupied to her time occupying the property. Betty will argue that Chris's possession was not continuous because he only occupied the land for 8 weeks of the year. However, Cahill v. Morrow found seasonal use to be acceptable to satisfy the continuous requirement. Finally, Chris's possession was hostile because it he was not on the property with the true owner (Betty's) permission. Betty may argue that Chris was on the property with the permission of the true ower, her deceased husband Andrew. If Betty won on this arguement, Chris's possession would only have been hostile starting in 2004, when Andrew died and Betty acquired his interest through the right of survivorship and became the full and true owner of Greenacre. Under the objective standard (Cahill v. Morrow), Chris's possession will satisfy the hostile requirement because all of his objective manifestations, via the improvements to the cabin and leaving the property to his daughter Debbie, show that he did not have a notion that anyone else had a superior claim of right or that he did not have a claim of right. Even under the minority subjective standard of a good faith (Tieu v. Morgan), Chris will still satisfy the hostile requirement because he was acting under color of title and believed he had a claim of right. However, under the minority subjective standard of bad faith (Dombkowski), Chris would fail to satisfy the hostile requirement because he did not have knowledge that he was on another's land and he was not intending to adversely possess someone else's property. Thus, unless New Suffolk follows the minority subjective standard of bad faith or Betty wins on her arguement that Chris was on the property with Andrew's permission, Chris satisfies all of the elements of adverse possession. However, Debbie's tacking arguement may still be difficult because she may not be in privity with Chris because he was acting under color of title and conveyed her color of title as well in his will. Thus, under the minority subjective standard of bad faith (Dombkowski), Chris would fail to satisfy the hostile requirement because he did not have knowledge that he was on another's land and he was not intending to adversely possess someone else's property. Thus, unless New Suffolk follows the minority subjective standard of bad faith or Betty wins on her arguement that Chris was on the property with Andrew's permission, Chris satisfies all of the elements of adverse possession. However, Debbie's tacking arguement may still be difficult because she may not be in privity with Chris because he was acting under color of title and conveyed her color of title as well in his will. Thus, the court will have to determine if it is possible for them to be in privity. The court will likely look at the good-faith of both Debbie and Chris and their honest, but mistaken belief that they lacked a claim of right, but will likely find that Debbie and Chris were not in privity because Chris conveyed Debbie color of title. Thus, Debbie's adverse possession claim will likely fail on the continuous element. Lastly, for a claimant's use to be hostile they must not be on the property with the permission of the true owner. Under the majority objective standard, the claimants subjective intent is irrelevant and the court instead looks to the claimant's objective manifestations to determine whether the claimant had a notion that they had a claim of right or someone else had a superior claim of right. In Cahill v. Morrow, the court held that a claimant's letter to the true owner offering to by the land she was claiming by adverse possession could jeopardize her hostile sufficiency because it showed that she had a notion that someone else had a superior claim to the property and that she may have had that notion throughout the entire statutory period. Here, Debbie's objective manifestations of building a house, clearing trees, and building a garden are evidence that she did not have a notion that anyone else had a superior claim or that she did not have a claim. Furthermore, under the subjective standard of good faith upheld in Tieu v. Morgan where a claimant must have an honest, but mistaken belief as to their claim of right, Debbie would satisfy the hostile element because she is a good faith claimant who was acting under color of title. However, just like her father Chris, Debbie would fail the hostile element in a bad faith subjective requirement minority jurisdiction, like the Dombkowski court, because she was not intentiionally trying to adversely possess someone else's land because she was acting under color of title and thought it was hers. However, only some jurisdictions look at the subjective intent so Debbie likely satisfies this element. Thus, the court will likely find that Debbie satisfies the elements of actual, exclusive, open and notorious, hostile (objective and subjective good faith), but fails to satisfy the elements of continuous and hostile (bad faith). However, when making its decision, the court will look at the policy reasons for adverse possession and likely come to an equitable remedy for this problem. Since Betty's property rights yield to Debbie's reliance interests, the court will consider how Betty was sleeping on her rights element. Thus, the court will likely find that Debbie satisfies the elements of actual, exclusive, open and notorious, hostile (objective and subjective good faith), but fails to satisfy the elements of continuous and hostile (bad faith). However, when making its decision, the court will look at the policy reasons for adverse possession and likely come to an equitable remedy for this problem. Since Betty's property rights yield to Debbie's reliance interests, the court will consider how Betty was sleeping on her rights and Debbie was making a productive use of property. Thus, although the statutory period has not been satisfied and the courts will likely find that Debbie cannot claim the property by adverse possession, they will have to come to an equitable remedy because Debby has built at great expense a full-time home and life on this property while Betty has been sleeping on her rights.

"," Dear Mr. Brock, Thank you for coming into my law office in search of advice for this situation you are in. After taking a close look at your situation we may have some solutions for you regarding the opportunity with the devoploper. We first need to address your connection with Alex, as it is seen right now that you are both tenants in common with each other. Being that alex and brock are tenants in common, they would be able to do either a partion in sale or a partion in kind. The only way this woudl not be possible is if they were joint tenants but this is not the case. A partition in kind is the first option that brock can try to take. A partition in kind would allow brock and alex to split the physcial property equally bewteen the the two of them. This way brock could possibly sell his portion to the real esate developer without affect alex and his brewery business. The problem with this is that the brewery takes up the entire property and would be hard to split the building in half between the two of them. The property has been broken up into a brewery, an on-site tasting room, and a small restaurant. Thus, making the partition in kind very inconvienent to both parties, being that the entities cannot be split evenly. The next option that brock could take is to do a partition in sale. A partition in sale would allow the parties to sell off the property and split the profits from the sale between each other. Thus allowing to the estate developer to take the property next, for the creation of the condos. The partion in sale would be the better option as the partion in kind was very inconvienent to the parties, with the lack of an even split of property. Secondly, the partion in sale would be more beneficial to both of the parties. But the next problem would be the partition would bring in any prejudice between the parties, which it looks like it most likely would. Alex is very invested into the property and would very much be against the partition. After many years of running the business and becomeing very successful, alex has become invested financailly and emotionally. With that being said, Alex who was the one to start the business before brock was invited to join, would very against the idea. Another, option brock would have is to sell of his portion of the property. Brock has become tired of it most likely would.

Another, option brock would have is to sell of his portion of the property. Brock has become tired of the brewing process and can no longer stand it. Giving him more reason to sell off his portion. Thus getting him out of his tenancy. 2) Dear Mr. Carl, Thank you for coming into my law office in search of advice for this situation you are in. After taking a close look at your situation we may have some solutions for you regarding the situation with the coins, coat and growler. We first need to address the possible connections with each item and then figure out what is the best course of actions for you to take. First the situation with the gold coins. It appears that with the coins, your best option would to claim that they are abandoned. With abandoned property the owner relinquished his claim to the property, thus giving rightful claim to the finder, which is Carl. Carl found the coins and after inspection the coins are obviosly from the late 1800s. Meaning that the owner of them is most likely dead and will not be returing to claim the coins. On the other hand if the next owner, the grocery store from 10 years ago, were to be the previous owner then I beleive that the brewery would have a claim to the coins. The brewery is the current owner of the property and the coins which were found on the property, would be in the brewery's possession. With the brewery being in control of the property, this also takes away the grocery stores claim to the title of the coins. With that being said the brewery which is private property, it would seem the coins may have been taken/stolen out of their possession. The brewery may have reason to bring claim agianst Carl for claim to the coins. So for the claim to the coins the brewery would mostl likley have better claim. Second would be the situation of the growler. This can be connected to Hyatt, where bailment was created by taking a ticket to a parking garage and parking a car in an enclosed parking garage, thus giving duty of care to the hotel/garage. Here, Carl brought his growler to the bar, handed it to the bartender, where the bartender gave carl a claim ticket and also put the same ticket number on the growler. Thus creating a proper bailment from carl to the bartender/bar. The bar now has a duty of care would mostl likley have better claim. Second would be the situation of the growler. This can be connected to Hyatt, where bailment was created by taking a ticket to a parking garage and parking a car in an enclosed parking garage, thus giving duty of care to the hotel/garage. Here, Carl brought his growler to the bar, handed it to the bartender, where the bartender gave carl a claim ticket and also put the same ticket number on the growler. Thus creating a proper bailment from carl to the bartender/bar. The bar now has a duty of care for the growler. The growler was then dropped by of the employees and the growler was then broken. Carl now would be able to bring a claim against the bar, for damages against his broken growler and be able to recover some compenastion. Lastly, the situation of the coat. It is unlikely that Carl could claim that there was a bailment in this case. Like in Hyatt and the growler situation, where a ticket was given in exchange for the property. Here, the coat was place on a coat rack where other people/public may also place there coats. This would be the same as parking a car on the public street, where there is no transfer of possesion. So, Carl would not be able to bring a bailment claim for the coat. On the other hand the coat rack was inside the a private building (the bar), thus giving reason to show that the bar did have some resposibilty to the coat. The coat rack was not outside, giving more reason for duty of care by the bar. The defense would likely lose. Carl can however claim that his coat was mislaid, explaing that he may have misplaced his coat when he came into the bar. This woudl mean that the bar would have a duty of care for the coat until Carl woudl be able to come back and claim the coat. Carl in this situation woudl have 12 months to do so, or he woudl relinquish his claim to the coat. The fact that Carl said,""forget it"" would imply that the coat woudl now be abandoned. The language that Carl used would imply that Carl gave up his title to his coat, thus giving rightful possession to the finder. 3) Dear Mr. Carl, Thank you for coming into my law office in search of advice for this situation you are in. After taking a close look at your situation we may have some solutions for you regarding the situation with the conceyance of your property. We first need to address the interests and then figure out what is the best course of actions for you to take. David has a contingent remainder in fee simple, the language used within the deed is ambiguous.When giving the conditions for the interest Alex uses the4 terms, so long as, as well as, if it is ever used. These terms would then contradict each other thus not making it clear what specific interst to go through with. close look at your situation we may have some solutions for you regarding the situation with the conceyance of your property.

These terms would then contradict each other thus not making it clear what specific interst to go through with. The two sons would have vested remainder subject to partial divestment, this is becuase david will either stay true to the condition or not, and at the time that he does not we will know the next interest will go to. Which woudl be the sons , so we know to whom it will vest to. In this siutation David changed from having only residential homes to having partial residential homes. The fact that there are still homes on the premise woudl indicate that edward could still have control over the property being that there are still homes being used on the property. On the other hand the deed says ONLY for homes but now it is not exclusive to homes. So becuase of the specific language int eh deed it woudl be more likely that the property would go to the sons. Edward has a fee simple determinable. This is because the language stated in the deed says, that so long as, thus pointing to a FS determinable. Alex woudl then have a possiblity of a reverter becasue if Edward does not stay true to the condition then the property would revert back to Alex. The deed states that IPA cannot be made on the property, if they are the property woudl go back to Alex. Here Ed decided to make IPAs so it is clear that he broke the condition of the deed, thus giving the property to Alex. "," Debbie v Betty Thank you for coming into my law office in search of advice for this situation you are in. After taking a close look at your situation we may have some solutions for you regarding the situation with greenacre. Betty Here at the start of the estate Betty and Andrew were both tenants in entirety. Thus meaing that betty still has claim to the property at hand. The fact that they never divorced woudl point to the fact that betty still has claim to the estate. On the other hand Andrew died thus seperating him from the tenancy thus making it fine to sell the estate to Chris. This woudl mean that Chris and betty woudl be tenants in common. this means that the conveyance from chris to debbie would valid after the death of chris. this would then indicate that both betty and debbie both and claim to estate and cant exclude either one.

This woudl mean that Chris and betty woudl be tenants in common. this means that the conveyance from chris to debbie would valid after the death of chris. this would then indicate that both betty and debbie both and claim to estate and cant exclude either one. Betty may also bring up that bebbie brought waste to the estate. debbie cleared out the trees and turned it into a formal garden, not only that she build a house on the property as well. this can be considered affirmative waste as she was purposeful to every waste she commited on the property. Courts may also look at this as Ameliorative waste, as the changes have increase the property value of the home, but decreased the value of what the property once was (vacation cabin in the woods). This way Betty can have reason to oust debbie from the property. Debbie Here debbie is in tenancy with betty so they cannot exclude each other from the estate. The only thing that debbie may be able to bring up is a claim for AP. Here, chris started to use the property in 2001 until he died in 2009 until his daughter started to use the property in 2011 until present day 2019. She could try to bring up tacking since the property was properly convey in privty to debbie from her father. The only problem with this is that for AP the possession needs to be continuous, which is where they might lose their claim for AP. chris was only on the land for eight weeks out of the year which would not satisify the claim for AP. he might be able to claim that it was a vacation home and that is how the homes like this are supposed to be used. This might give the courts reason to given him the continuous factor for AP. The other problem is that the land was not used exclusivly. Chris allowed neighbors to use the land for hunting while he was not there, and he was not there for the majority of the year. Not only woudl this hurt his chances for AP but it woudl also hurt debbie's chances for tack and privity in her AP claim to the land as well. thus making her claim for AP unlikely. AP would be satisified for Actual as both of them were living on the property as a true owner would. Hostility, if where against the true owner who was Betty then it woudl be hostile because they did not ask for permission from her to be there, but chris did purchase the land which goes against hostile. Open and notorious would be met as they both were living there and if Betty made trips to the land she woudl have known like the other hunter in the area who have seen them there regularly. 5) AP would be satisified for Actual as both of them were living on the property as a true owner would.

d4d87348-bef9-4bd1-8adc-5e18aec9f14e," First we must identify all of the present and future interest in the conveyance from Oliver. We know that this is a grant will take effect the moment it is received because of the language ""grants"". Also Oliver is still alive. His children Connor and Carla both have fee simple subject to executory limiations. We know this because they have to fulful a condition in order to have the property. Robert has a vested remainder in a life estate. He has this because he is an ascertained person and he doesn't have to complete any condtion to gain possesion. Remainder's are the polite future interest because they have to wait for the natural end of a life. Here, Robert has to wait for the ""the first of O's children to retire, life to end, in order to gain possession. The next future interest we have in the grant is for Victor and Vivian. Victor because he is 26 has a vested remainder subject to open/partial divesment. Victor has this because he is an ascertained person who has already fulfilled the requirements needs to take possesion. However, it's not indefeasbily vested because Vivian who is alive at the time of conyence could turn 25 and also take possession of the property as co-tenants with Victor. As well as any other grandchildren of Oliver to turn 25. So, Vivian has a cont rem in fee simple, because she has not yet turned 25. Rules against Perpetuties (RAP) has been around for some time, it is set in place to aid in restraining alienability and dead hand control from the grantor. Basically, set in place so that the grantor cannot make decsions about property when he has been dead for some time now and we don't know whether or not the conveyance will vest or fail. The rule only applies to cont. rem., vested remainders subject to open and executory interest, as well as option contracts. RAP states that anything is void if it cant not vest or fail within the lifetime of any life in being at the creation of the grant plus 21 years. Here, RAP applies to all of the future interest except for Robert the newphew. Robert's interest is not subject to RAP because life estates are not subject to the rule, because it is a present interest and presetn interest are not subject to RAP, therefor his interest is valid. The parents conveyance is subject to RAP, but because they are acertained we will know at the end of their lives if they will retire or not. Therefore valid. However, Oliver's conveyance, ""to his grandchildren vest or fail within the lifetime of any life in being at the creation of the grant plus 21 years. Here, RAP applies to all of the future interest except for Robert the newphew. Robert's interest is not subject to RAP because life estates are not subject to the rule, because it is a present interest and presetn interest are not subject to RAP, therefor his interest is valid. The parents conveyance is subject to RAP, but because they are acertained we will know at the end of their lives if they will retire or not. Therefore valid. However, Oliver's conveyance, ""to his grandchildren who reach 25"" is subject to RAP. We know this because the conveyance is a future interest following the life of Robert and some remainders are subject to the rule. indefiably vested remainders are not subject to RAP because they are an ascretained person at the time of conveyance who have fulfilled all they need to do to accquire possession, and there is no chance of someone cutting that interest short or divesting it. But the grandchildren of Oliver, have cont remainders and vested remainders subject to open. Vivian has a contigent remainder because she is an ascertained person, but she has not fulfilled the condtion of turning 25. Once she does turn 25 she can become a vested remainder subject to open as well because there can still be more children after her. Victor's vested remainder subject to open is also subject to RAP. Because he is an ascertained person who has fulfilled the condtion at the time of conveyance, but it's subject to open because this is a class gift, and other grandchildren may join the class as well. This would conveyance is void under RAP because Oliver could have more children at any moment, who could then also have children who would fit into the class of gift. Suppose Oliver has another child X and then dies right after, X could also have a child, Y, 30 years later who would could then also be able to accquire the class gift. Therefore the class gift is void. There is a way however to save the class gift, usually, in common law, once a class gift has been granted and 1 person has fulfilled it, the class will close, leaving out anyone who hasn't fulfilled the condition. But in modern law there is a rule of conveyance which saves a class gift for other people who are alive at the time of conveyance so that they can also receive the gift as well. Here, Vivian becomes her own measuring life and if she makes it to age 25, she can also claim the property as well. "," 1a: Brock making money To: Brock From: Associate Hello Brock, thank you for taking the time to come to my law office for help regarding your property Part III 1a: Brock making money To: Brock From: Associate Hello Brock, thank you for taking the time to come to my law office for help regarding your property you share with your brother, Alex. First we will tell you what kind of rights you have in co-ownership with Alex. Next, i'll tell you all the possiblities you might have in making some money from that developer. I have cited some cases for you, in the paragraph if, you'd like to do future research. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact our offices for clarification. You and Alex share a type of co-ownership called tenancy in common or co-tenancy. When Alex granted the deed the conveyed the land to himself and you that it what made. The language though not entirely clear does state that he wanted you to hold it ""jointly"", maybe as joint tenants with the right of surviourship, the law assumes tenancy in common, when there is the absence of the ""right of suviourship"". Having a tenancy in common might be better for you in this instance than a JTWROS. Although Alex did recieve title to the land before you, when he reconveyed the land to himself and you that gave way to the 4 unities need to forfill a JTWROS, which are time, title, interest and possesion. Usually in common law, you would need a strawman or a third party to convey the deed to, and they would subsquecently convey the deed back to you and the party they wanted to make a joint tenacny with. But in modern law you do not require that third party to do so, so Alex's conveyance to himself statifies trying to makew a JTWROS. Also, it might be a little questionable to asses the percetnage of interest that you have. You told me thaty you have half the interest in the warehouse, usually with JTWROS, the tenants share equal interest in the whole. Why I think it is best for you to have a co- tenancy and not a JTWROS is because in a JTWROS, you are not allowed to convey, transfer or mortage the land without it severing the jointly owned property, also a big difference here and why you cannot devise a JTWROS is because when one of you dies, their interest is automatically transfered to the other party. Now that we have estblished that you have a Co-tenancy, we should talk about your rights with this type of co-ownership. First you have a 50% share in the warehouse, but you are allowed to use all of it. This is what we call having an undivided intereest in the whole. Because you would like to make some money from the developers and you hold a 50% stake in the ware house you can sell your portion of the warehouse to the developers for half of their asking price, and they would have to deal with Alex, which the other party. Now that we have estblished that you have a Co-tenancy, we should talk about your rights with this type co-ownership. First you have a 50% share in the warehouse, but you are allowed to use all of it. This is what we call having an undivided intereest in the whole. Because you would like to make some money from the developers and you hold a 50% stake in the ware house you can sell your portion of the warehouse to the developers for half of their asking price, and they would have to deal with Alex, which would be unlikely, because they probably wouldn't buy just half of the property from you. Or you can try to convience your brother to sell, which is probably not an option because he told you he wasnt selling. He aslo told you to never come back, which is trying to oust you, or gain exclusive possesion. He can not do that without a partition, so do not let his words in the heat of the moment get to you. Another option would be to petition the court for a partition in sale. Usually a partition in sale is not what the courts like to do, but if you and Alex really can not agree about sellin gthe place and you both end up better off finiancly the court will approve it. A partition in sale is when you sell the property and divide the value of the sale coresponding to the amount you own in the property. This was citied in the Delfino case, where the one of the tenenats did not want to move, or sell because she had attachment to the property and ran her business there. Here, you each own a 50% stake, so you each will get half and half of the profits, but it looks like your brother also has some semitmal relationship with the property just as in Delfino, and the courts will look at all of the factors in deciding. I think your best best would be to ask for a partition in kind, where you physically divide the property up, based again on percentage. Here, you could get the 5 acres to sell to the developers, where it would get tricky because of the warehouse, and physcially dividing free standing strucutures usuually never works. What you could do is see if the 10 acres of land is worth the same as the warehouse, and ask Alex to shift your interest so that you can claim all of the land and he can keep his warehouse. That way you could possibly sell the land to the developers and see if you can make some money that way. Best, Associate 1b Carl found coins To: Carl From: Associate Hello Carl, thank you for taking the time to come to my law office for help regarding the your ownership rights in the coins you found and if there's anything we can do to recover your coat and growler. First 1b Carl found coins To: Carl From: Associate Hello Carl, thank you for taking the time to come to my law office for help regarding the your ownership rights in the coins you found and if there's anything we can do to recover your coat and growler. First I'll will tell you what kind of rights you have in the coins you found. Next, i'll tell you all the possiblities you might have in recovering your coat and growlker. I have cited some cases for you, in the paragraph if, you'd like to do future research. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact our offices for clarification. First, the coins you found invoke found property in law. Where you found the coins, and the condition you found them in all play key parts, in figuring out who they legally belong to. Usually we hear finder's keepers, losers weepers on the playground as children, but that is not the case in finders law. The gold coins, were in a mesh shopping bag, with the logo of the store that was there before the brewey, implying that someone intentionally placed it there and probably forget whhere they put it, and then the proerty was sold. This is what we called mislaid property. Just like in the McCovy case, where the true owner left their wallet in the barbershop, here, the true owner probably put the coins in the mesh bag and forget where they left the bag. This would mean that fo you, the best owner would be someone in the grocery store who put it there, and the best title would be the brewery because, in any case if the true owners return, they are usually going to be looking in the place the remember they misplaced it. But the coins could also be abandond property. Abandoned property is property that has been intentionally left, and the true owner has relinquished all rights to it. This usually means that the best owner would be the finder. The brewery will argue however that the coins were embedded in the structure of the warehouse. Embedded property is usally, found while unearthing plots of land and other excavation efforts and usually goes to the owner of the land that it is found. Because the coins date back to the late 1800's, they would be considered antiqutiy, and some states have a law about who collects when they find treasure. Usually when it is a tresure trove claim, the finder will get possesion even if it is on their land because, as a society we want to reward people who have put effort into uncovering something, not just the owner of the land, who did nothing to get the property. In Corliss, the court jurisdiction did not use treasure trove law and the treasure the employee's found were given to the property owner using the justifcation of embedded law. Also just like the Benjamin Aviation, case where the court looked at how the found property was packaged when found, to find the best owner. The best claim I think you would have in getting to keep the gold coins would be if it was a treasure trove, but I would have to do find treasure. Usually when it is a tresure trove claim, the finder will get possesion even if it is on their land because, as a society we want to reward people who have put effort into uncovering something, not just the owner of the land, who did nothing to get the property. In Corliss, the court jurisdiction did not use treasure trove law and the treasure the employee's found were given to the property owner using the justifcation of embedded law. Also just like the Benjamin Aviation, case where the court looked at how the found property was packaged when found, to find the best owner. The best claim I think you would have in getting to keep the gold coins would be if it was a treasure trove, but I would have to do more research to see if we are in a jursidiction that does follow that law. In the contray then the coins would either be mislaid or embedded usually going back to the property owner. Next we want to figure out if a bailee, bailor relationship has been made between you and the warehouse. We want to know if we can recover the money from your coat and from the broken growler. First, we must see if a bailment relationship has been made. A bailment is a temporary transfer of tangible items, the the bailee (person getting temporary possession) has to hold a reasonable duty of care to protect while in their custody. I beleive becasue of the nature of the transaction. We have to look at the totality of the circumcstances for each scenario for bailments. Just like in the Allen v. Hyatt case, they also looked at the circumstances to see if a bailment relationship was made. They looked at the enclosed parking garage, the attendant on duty, the sercuity cameras, etc, and the court decided that yes, a reasonable person would assume that the baliee was going to take some affriming steps and make sure their property was protected. Here, the brewery gave you a ticket with mathcins numbers, as well as attaching the tag to be able to identify what was yours. I believe that you are entitled to collect from the brewry for the loss of your growler. The coat the otherhand, i do not beleive that they had a reasonable duty to protect your coat. 1c Hello Alex, The issue is identifing what kind of rights the new owners have with the brewery and land. When Brock sold his interest to you, you now had the property in fee simple. Fee simple means that you own the property exclusivley. You sold one portion to David (D) and the other portion to Edward (E). The grant you conveyed the properties to created some present interest and some future interest. David: received a Fee simple subject to executory limitation, which means that your two sons would be the future interest holder and they both had an executory intereest. Executory interest cut short the posession if a certain condition or event or duration happens and transfers it to a third party. Here this conveyance is subject to RAP as explained above. This conveyance, unforutnatlely is void under RAP. property exclusivley. You sold one portion to David (D) and the other portion to Edward (E). The grant you conveyed the properties to created some present interest and some future interest. David: received a Fee simple subject to executory limitation, which means that your two sons would be the future interest holder and they both had an executory intereest. Executory interest cut short the posession if a certain condition or event or duration happens and transfers it to a third party. Here this conveyance is subject to RAP as explained above. This conveyance, unforutnatlely is void under RAP. There is just no way that this conveyance could vest or fail in a life in being at the time of the creation plus twenty one years. You say that the land is not allowed to be used for residential purposes, but long after you are gone, and D is gone, the land somehow could be used for residentatial purposes and your sons could never have them in fee simple. We would have to strike it the parts that ar void, leaving D with a fee simple deterinable and you the grantor with a possibilty of revertor. Edward: recieved a Fee simple determinable, because if he made or sold IPA's you the grantor would have a possibilty of revertor. We know this because you used words of duration and not words of condition. Words of condition would make a Fee simple subject to condition subsquent, which would give you, the grantor a Right of re-entry and you would not be able to assume possession immdietaly. Here, you juimbled the langague for both those type of interest. In Marhenholz, the court ruled that when ambuguity in conveyance, the court tries to fufill the grantos wishes. We know how storngly you do not want IPA's to made on the premises, so the court would probably rule in havin gthe possibilty of a revertor, which means the land would go back to you automatically. When they both, violate your wishes you can possess the properties again. "," The issue is what Debbies rights are as a property owner in Greenarce. A + B own GA as joint tenancy in the entirety and in states where they follow that rule, gthe couple have access to the entire land, as one. When he sold his interest to C he severed the joint tenancy and now B and C owned it as co- tenants. becaause of the nature of the sale, and because it was not in good faith thus, not binding, B actually owned the entire thing in Fee simple. Because just like a JTWROS, when one party dies, the other one automatically gets possesion of the entire thing. Thus, GA belonging to B. C can claim title to the land via adverse possesion and color of title. Color of title is when you gain possession of land through a defective deed. You have to statify the AP elements of continous, actual, hostile, open and notrious and exclusivity. Here, C used the land for the entire AP statutory period, from 2001, until he died leaving it to his actually owned the entire thing in Fee simple. Because just like a JTWROS, when one party dies, the other one automatically gets possesion of the entire thing. Thus, GA belonging to B. C can claim title to the land via adverse possesion and color of title. Color of title is when you gain possession of land through a defective deed. You have to statify the AP elements of continous, actual, hostile, open and notrious and exclusivity. Here, C used the land for the entire AP statutory period, from 2001, until he died leaving it to his daughter. This statifys AP, because of the rule of privitiy. The rule of priviity states that owners who are adversly possessing the land may tack their time together through a voluntary sale. (tiue v. morgan) Here, though not a cvoluntarty sale, C thought he had the land in fee simple, and devising it to D should be conisdered. And as well as that, C used the land like a fishing owner would, visiting and lodging there in the cabin for fishing season. We know that when you have property that is used like a reasonable owner would use it, it clears this element. Thus, clearing the Contiuous element. Hostile: C and Debbie both used the land without permission of the true owner B. Exclusive: C + D both held the land exclusive to B. Just because he let, his friends use the lodge when he was not there did not mean he did not statify this element. As a property owner you have the right to invite people in. If C abandoned the property everytime, the true owner came it would not count. But he thought he was the true owner. As well as Debbie living there full time. Actual: C + D both actually entered the land. This element requires physical pressence. Here, C was on the land for fishing season like any other fisherman would be. Debbie really was actually on the land because she lived there full time. Open and Notorious: C and D both used the land like a true owner would. D has a garden and allows other people to use her property, unafriad that someone might see. This use, is visble and could put the true owner on notice. Thus D can claim title to the entire plot of land with the defective deed through adverse possesion. And Betty is out of luck because she did not evict the Adverse possessors within the statotuy time.

de219fed-6a0e-4796-875c-300be31e1347," O has a present possessory fee simple subject to executory limitation; Connor has an executory interest in life estate; Carla has an executory interest in life estate; Robert has a remainder in life estate; Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple; Vivian has a contingent remainder in fee simple; Oliver's grandchildren yet to be born have a contingent remainder in fee simple. As for the children's interests, they are void under the Rule against Perpetuities because if both of the lives in being at the time of the grant, Connor and Carla, happen to die, and Oliver has another child, that interest would not vest within 21 years of Connor or Carla's life in being. Even if Oliver was measured as the life in being at the time of the grant, if he had a child, and died immediately afterward, then it would be unreasonable to expect that his child would retire 21 years after Oliver's death. Robert's interest is valid under the Rule agaisnt Perpetuities because he is a life in being at the time of the grant, and therefore, his interest will certainly vest within 21 years of his life in being. Vivian's interest is valid under the Rule against Perpetuities via the Rule of Convenience, which allows us to say that once one party of a class has met the condition for a remainder to vest, then we assume that all parties who are alive in the class will have vested interests as well. However, the interests of Oliver's grandchildren who are yet to be born would be void under the rule against perpetuity, as they are left out of the Rule of Convenience, and could not turn 25 within 21 years of a life in being. In order to amend the void interests of Connor and Carla, the will could be amended to read ""to my children for life"" or ""to the first of my children for life."" The unborn grandchildren's interests could be amended if the will said ""then to my grandchildren."" 2) are yet to be born would be void under the rule against perpetuity, as they are left out of the Rule of Convenience, and could not turn 25 within 21 years of a life in being. In order to amend the void interests of Connor and Carla, the will could be amended to read ""to my children for life"" or ""to the first of my children for life."" The unborn grandchildren's interests could be amended if the will said ""then to my grandchildren."" "," 1a. As for Brock's property interest, the issue is whether or not the conveyance to he and his brother which reads ""to myself and my brother Brock to hold jointly as tenants in common"" conveys an interest in tenancy in common or in joint tenancy. If the interest creates a tenancy in common, then Brock could likely claim for a partition by sale or a partition in kind to acquire some money from the developer. However, if the interest is in a joint tenancy, then Brock would not be able to unilaterally transfer his interest to anyone. In line with common law principles, courts generally prefer to adopt tenancy in common in the event of ambiguous language. Alex would likely argue that the deed conveyed the interest to them in a joint tenancy. As a result of a joint tenancy, Brock would not be able to unilaterally transfer his interest at all, and would therefore not be able to transfer any property to the developer. However, as a result of the aforementioned language in the deed appearing to be contradictory, the court would likely hold that the deed created a tenancy in common between the brothers. Therefore, Brock's course of action could be to pursue a partition. Court's generally prefer to adopt partitions in kind, but are inclined to opt for a partition by sale in the event that the property at hand is not easily partitioned and that a partition by sale is in the best interest of the parties. In this case, it would be admittedly difficult to order a partition in kind, due to the nature of the business being on the property. A partition in kind would be nearly impossible to split up a business, and it would likely be detrimental to the business, and Alex's livelihood. Therefore, it is unlikely that the court would order a partition in kind. In that event, the court would likely order a partition by sale to the tenants in common, as it would prevent the issue of physically partitioning a unique property with a business, and would allow the brother's to both be compensated equally for the property. 1b. As for the issue with the gold coins that Carl found, the question is whether the coins were mislaid, lost, abandoned, or embedded, and depending on what the nature of the found property, who has an of money found in an airplane wing belonged to interest in it? The Benjamin case ruled that a large 3sum the owner of the property where the property was found because it was mislaid. In order for property to be mislaid, it must have been voluntarily placed somewhere, and subsequently forgotten. While one prevent the issue of physically partitioning a unique property with a business, and would allow the brother's to both be compensated equally for the property. 1b. As for the issue with the gold coins that Carl found, the question is whether the coins were mislaid, lost, abandoned, or embedded, and depending on what the nature of the found property, who has an interest in it? The Benjamin case ruled that a large sum of money found in an airplane wing belonged to the owner of the property where the property was found because it was mislaid. In order for property to be mislaid, it must have been voluntarily placed somewhere, and subsequently forgotten. While one party in the case argued that the property was likely abandoned, because it was wrapped neatly and placed in a very specific area, the court rejected that argument in favor of ruling that the property was mislaid, because mislaid property gives the opportunity for the founder to seek out the item. Further, the court gave consideration to how long the money had been in the airplane wing, and since it had not been a great deal of time, giving the true owner the opporunity to reclaim the property was in their best interest. Consequently, Carl's finding of the gold coins at the brewery is similar to the Benjamin case. Carl found valuable property in a very particular, hard to reach place on property that belonged to someone else. Additionally, the gold coins, although old themselves, were found in a bag from a 10 year old grocery store, indicating that the property was placed there within the past 10 years. It is ultimately likely that the court will find that the property was mislaid, just like the court in Benjamin. 10 years is a relatively short time, and it is reasonable that the true owner could reclaim the property. Therefore, the court would likely hold that the coins belong to the brewery. However, Carl could argue similarly to the counterargument in Benjamin, by saying that because of how inconspicuous of a space the property was left in, it was likely deliberately put there by the true owner, and subsequently abandoned. However, this argument would likely not prevail, as the short period of time that the coins were there, in addition to the fact that they were not neatly placed, and instead could have hastily been in a grocery store bag, would persuade the court to rule that the property was mislaid. As for Carl's growler, the issue is whether or not there was a bailment relationship between the bartender and Carl. The rule in the Allen case is that if a person relinquishes possession and control of subject matter to another party, then there is a bailment relationship that is created. In the Allen case, the car owner left a car in a gated parking garage that was patrolled by security after taking a ticket from a machine at the gate. The court found that a bailment relationship was created, because the garage's act of issuing a ticket, in addition to the security and gate maintaining the property, constitued possession and control over the car. Similarly, Carl gave his growler to the bartender, who subsequently issued him a ticket that corresponded with his growler. That exchange indicates that the bartender is taking sufficient possession of the growler. As for the element of control, the argument would be that because the ticket's number directly corresponded with the numbered ticket attached to the growler, the owner left a car in a gated parking garage that was patrolled by security after taking a ticket from a machine at the gate. The court found that a bailment relationship was created, because the garage's act issuing a ticket, in addition to the security and gate maintaining the property, constitued possession and control over the car. Similarly, Carl gave his growler to the bartender, who subsequently issued him a ticket that corresponded with his growler. That exchange indicates that the bartender is taking sufficient possession of the growler. As for the element of control, the argument would be that because the ticket's number directly corresponded with the numbered ticket attached to the growler, the bartender took enough of a precaution to exercise control over the growler. Therefore, it is likely that a court would find that there was sufficient possession and control over the growler to constitute a bailment relationship between Carl and the bartender. However, the bartender could invoke the dissent of the Allen case, which notes that the ticket which was issued at the exchange is merely a receipt, and does not indicate any formal possession or control over the subject matter, meaning that there would be no bailment relationship because the garage did not take full control and possession over the subject matter. In the present case, that argument would likely not prevail, as it is clear that the ticket issued to Carl was more than a receipt of the exchange, and clearly allowed the bartender to locate the corresponding growler which they were responsible for returning to the true owner. Finally, a court would have to find that the person who took control of the subject matter acted negligently when the property in their possession was lost or destroyed. While there are few facts in the present case to determine, Carl could likely argue that having a ""new"" employee working with his valued glassware is sufficiently negligent to hold the bartender liable. The issue as to Carl's coat is whether or not the coat was abandoned. In the event of abandoned property, the right of title belongs to the finder. In the present case, Carl goes to look for his coat on a hook, where he would have voluntarily left it. The property could not have been mislaid, as he did not forget about the coat, but merely left it in a spot. In abandoning the coat, Carl surrenders his right to the coat to the finder. However, there could be a possibility that Carl tries to evoke a bailment relationship with the brewery for his coat. The presence of the hook could indicate that the brewery intends to take possession and control of the coat while it is out of Carl's possession. However, this fact pattern would likely fail the Allen test because there is no formal exchange of the coat, such as the giving of a ticket that would be seen at a formal coat check. Since Carl did not transfer possession into another person's hand in an exchange of possession and control, it is not likely that Carl could invoke a bailment relationship in the case of his coat. Rather, it is likely that Carl's coat would be considered abandoned property, and thus would belong to the finder of the coat. 7 1c. The grant to David has ambiguous language which conveys a fee simple determinable to David with likely fail the Allen test because there is no formal exchange of the coat, such as the giving of a ticket that would be seen at a formal coat check. Since Carl did not transfer possession into another person's hand in an exchange of possession and control, it is not likely that Carl could invoke a bailment relationship in the case of his coat. Rather, it is likely that Carl's coat would be considered abandoned property, and thus would belong to the finder of the coat. 1c. The grant to David has ambiguous language which conveys a fee simple determinable to David with language like ""so long as"" but also language of fee simple subject to condition subsequent with the conditional ""if"" and the subsequent conveyance ""then to my two sons Frank and Fred.""In the event of this ambiguous language, the court usually invokes Mahrenholtz which ruled that there is a presumption for a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in the event of ambiguous language. As a result of this presumption, the grantor would have the right to re-enter the property, as opposed to the possibility of reverter that would have been granted with the fee simple determinable. As a result, David would have a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and Alex would have a right of re-entry in fee simple. Further, Alex's sons, Frank and Fred, would not have any interest, unless Alex re-entered the property after the condition was fulfilled, and Alex then conveyed the property to them. Similarly, the conveyance to Edward has conflicting language. The language of ""so long as"" creates a fee simple determinable, but conflicts with the language of ""Alex has the right to re-enter and reclaim the premises."" Because of this ambiguous language, the court would again invoke Mahrenholtz and would prefer to find a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. As a result, Edward and his heirs would have a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and Alex would have a right of entry in fee simple. As a result of both Edward and David fulfilling their conditions, Alex would be able to re-enter the properties and assert his right of re-entry to take back the property. 3) "," The issue as to Betty's claim to the property would be whether or not Andrew had the ability to unilaterally transfer the property as tenants by the entirety. As a tenant by the entirety, Andrew was not able to transfer the property away, such as in Craft. Without her signature, he was not able to transfer the property to Chris. As a result, Betty would still inevitably hold a claim to the property's title. The issue as to Debbie's claim to the property would 7 whether or not her father was a good faith be purchaser. According to Kotis, a fraudster can transfer property with voidable title to a good faith purchaser. In the present case, Chris was a college friend of Andrew, and did not suspect any foul play. The issue as to Betty's claim to the property would be whether or not Andrew had the ability to unilaterally transfer the property as tenants by the entirety. As a tenant by the entirety, Andrew was not able to transfer the property away, such as in Craft. Without her signature, he was not able to transfer the property to Chris. As a result, Betty would still inevitably hold a claim to the property's title. The issue as to Debbie's claim to the property would be whether or not her father was a good faith purchaser. According to Kotis, a fraudster can transfer property with voidable title to a good faith purchaser. In the present case, Chris was a college friend of Andrew, and did not suspect any foul play. Because of this, it is likely that he would be considered a good faith purchaser under the Kotis rule. Therefore, he would be able to legitimately transfer the property to Debbie by will. However, even if Chris weren't considered a good faith purchaser, the argument could be made that Debbie has adverse possession over the property. Adverse possession requires actual, exclusive, hostile, and open and notorious possession that is continuous generally for about 10 years, as shown in the Marengo case. Actual possession was indicated by virtue of the cabin on the property. Debbie was clear that her neighbors were not allowed onto her property without her permission, which fulfills the exclusivity element. Her possession was open and notorious, as is evidenced by the structures on the property. Further, this possession was full-time and continuous for 10 years. However, there could be an argument as to whether or not the possession was hostile. Some courts have found that hostile possession requires notifying the true owner of possession. Meanwhile others, such as the Cahill court, have ruled that if there must be an objective indiciation of the mindset of the possessor, and that they must think that their claim is superior to all other. In the present case, there is no objective indication, such as in Cahill, that Debbie thought that her claim was subservient to another. Therefore, it is likely that she could claim adverse possession over the property. Ultimately, it is likely that Debbie would hold the superior claim to the property, being that her father, Chris, was a good faith purchaser from a fraudster and that she adversely possessed the property for over 10 years. As a result of the adverse possession, and in consideration of the other factors, it is likely that Debbie would hold a superior claim to the property over Betty. ",425,1971,565
45942e14-a556-414d-b4d7-9287409db104," Interests before Rap: Oliver Owner has a possessory fee simple subject to executory limitation The first child to retire has an executory interest in a life estate (the life estate part is potentially an issue) Robert has a vested remainder life estate Victor has a vested remainder in fee simple subject to open The rest of the potential grandchildren have a contingent remainder in fee simple absolute Oliver Owner also maintains a reversion (if the rule of convenience is not followed) Rule: The rule against perpetuities states that the grant must vest within 21 years of a life in being. An example can be found in Symphony Space Analysis: At the time of the grant, no one is able to take possession so Olive maintains possession in fee simple. However, his possession is now defeasible once one of his children retires so his possession is subject to executory limitation. The first child to retire's interest vests immediately when one retires. The executory interest is void under Rule against perpetuties. Carla and Conner are their own vesting lives so if you applied a wait and see approach, the court could wait to see if they retire. However, tomorrow Oliver can have a third child, let's call him Jack, and everyone else alive could die. Jack was not a life in being at the time of the grant so he cannot be a validating life. He may not retire for 60 years, violating rap because the grant could vest after 21 years of a life in being. Roberts interest is vested because whether or not the children retire and when does not disturb his claim. Whether it vests or fails with them, he will still get his life estate. The grant to the grandchildren is tricky. Without Victor, the grant would be void under the RAP because Jack, mentioned above, could have a child, Jill, and all the lives in being at the time of the grant being at the time of the grant so he cannot be a validating life. He may not retire for 60 years, violating rap because the grant could vest after 21 years of a life in being. Roberts interest is vested because whether or not the children retire and when does not disturb his claim. Whether it vests or fails with them, he will still get his life estate. The grant to the grandchildren is tricky. Without Victor, the grant would be void under the RAP because Jack, mentioned above, could have a child, Jill, and all the lives in being at the time of the grant could die and Jill would not reach the age of 25 with 21 years of everyones death. However, Victor is alive and has already satisfied the condition (being 25) that is needed for the interest to vest. Many jurisdictions would apply the rule of convenience here and close the potential class to only those grandchildren who are currently living. With this interpretation, Victor would have a vested remainder in fee simple absolute subject to open ONLY if vivian reaches 25 and Vivian would have a contingent remainder that would vest when she turned 25. If any other grandchildren were born they would not be part of this grant. Only Vivian and Victor could satisfy this interest. If the rule of convenience was not followed, the grandchildren would get nothing and it would revert back to the grantor.

Below is a break down of the issues I believe you are facing, the relevant laws that govern them and my legal advise to you. "," Essay 1 Part A Dear Brock, It was nice meeting you today. Below is a break down of the issues I believe you are facing, the relevant laws that govern them and my legal advise to you. Issue: What property interest does Brock have in the wearehouse? Rule: When two parties have a joint interest in property there are three kinds: Tenancy in Common, Joint Tenancy and Tenancy by entiritety. Analysis: Based on the the words in the deed Alex created, it is likely you have a Tenancy in Common. While there is language like ""jointly"" suggesting a joint tenancy, it is not explicit enough to form a joint tenancy. The courts prefer a Tenancy in Common has less rules to regulate. (A tenancy by entiretly is only for married couples). In a Tenancy In Common (TIC) parties, while entitled to the use of the entirety own fractional shares. Here, you own 50% and Alex owns 50% of the property. Conclusion: Brock owns 50% of the property as a tenant in common. Issue: How can you make money from the developer? Rule: You could file for a partition. A partition by kind is preferred- where the land is divided into two plots of porportionate sizes and each tenant can do what they please with it. There is also a partition by sale option in which the court would sell the land and you would each reap your respective proportions of the benefits. In order for the court to force a partition of sale, there are 3 factors (1) is a partion in kind is inconvenient? (2) Would one party benefit greatly more than the other? (3) Does any party have a specific interest in keeping the land (a business on the land or sentimental value?) This reasoning was created by the Delfino Case Analysis: First, the major problem here is that your brother does have a specific interest in the property. Like the defendant in Delfino, they are operating a business on the property and do not want to move. However, unlike that case where the business had been there for decades, your brewery has only been there for 5 years so there is less of a firm personal value attached to the land. Second, both parties would benefit by the sale because both you and your brother are giving up the business and getting cash back. If one party had a4 business on the land and the other had an interest in the land but did not use it, it would benefit the non-user to sell the land more than the user because they weren't giving as much up in profits or location value. Here, your interests are equal and you are both Like the defendant in Delfino, they are operating a business on the property and do not want to move. However, unlike that case where the business had been there for decades, your brewery has only been there for 5 years so there is less of a firm personal value attached to the land. Second, both parties would benefit by the sale because both you and your brother are giving up the business and getting cash back. If one party had a business on the land and the other had an interest in the land but did not use it, it would benefit the non-user to sell the land more than the user because they weren't giving as much up in profits or location value. Here, your interests are equal and you are both giving part up. Your brother may argue that he is giving more up because he has more emotional investment in the business but as you mentioned, there would be enough profit to start a new business . Third, and this is your strongest arguement, it could be incredibely impracticable to divide the land in kind depending on the size of the warehouse.. It is one brewery. It is unclear how much space the warehouse takes up. Your brother could argue that he would take the 50% of the 10 acres that has the warehouse on it and you could have the other 50% of the land. This may afford you with more than 5 acres since the warehouse has inheritly hire property value then undeveloped land. If you divided it in kind, you may be able to sell the developer your portion of the land. Your brother may pay you an owelty if the warehouse takes up more than 50% of the worth of the property. Conclusion: While you may have a case for partition in sale based on the property size, if the property can be divided fairly and your brother wants a partition in kind, the court will rule in his favor. I suggest speaking with your brother again to convince him to sell. If does not agree, speak to the developer and get a price for your portion of the land. 3) Essay Question 1 B Dear Carl, It was nice meeting you today. While it is a conflict of interest to be speaking to you about issues involving the brewery, I will still preceed. Below is a break down of the issues I believe you are facing, the relevant laws that govern them and my legal advise to you. Issue: What legal rights do you have to the gold coins you found Rule: This issue invokes finder's law. Items that are lost (typically dropped in a public place), then found, belong to the rightful owner first and then the finder. Items that a mislaid- placed there specifically by the owner and then forgotten-- belong to the rightful owner first and then the land owner involving the brewery, I will still preceed. Below is a break down of the issues I believe you are facing, the relevant laws that govern them and my legal advise to you. Issue: What legal rights do you have to the gold coins you found Rule: This issue invokes finder's law. Items that are lost (typically dropped in a public place), then found, belong to the rightful owner first and then the finder. Items that a mislaid- placed there specifically by the owner and then forgotten-- belong to the rightful owner first and then the land owner where the item was found. A little used classification is a treasure trove item. Treasure trove items are a kin to buried treasure and must have a sense of antiquity to them. They belong to the rightful owner first and then then to the finder. Abandoned property goes to the finder above all others. Analysis: Your situation is similar to two cases. First, Corilis, a construction man digging a new driveway found gold coins buried under the asphalt. The court held that, despite the coins being 100 years old, they were not treasure trove coins. They were mislaid. The reasoning was that the coins were wrapped in cloth indicating that they were carefully placed and the court did not want to create a policy that encouraged people to dig up their neighbors yards looking for gold or treasure. They ruled that the coins belonged to the owners of the land. Similarly in Benjamin, a person found money behind the wall of an airplane owned by the bank. Again, the court ruled that the money was misplaced (likely by criminals) and they belonged to the bank, the owner of the plane. Your case is similar to these in many ways as they were antique coins found on another's property. While you may argue that these coins are treasure trove items since they are over 200 years old- much older than the coins in the past cases, the fact that they were wrapped in a bag from a store that only opened 10 years ago contridicts the antiquity claim. Clearly they were not buried gold. However, another arguement you could make are that these coins were abandoned. If Alex and and Brock were not the ones to place them there, they were left there by the former owner. You may argue that by selling the place with them there, he abandoned them. Abandoned property goes to the finder. Unfortunately that is not a strong argument and Alex can always claim that in purchasing the land where they were, he was also purchasing them. While I cannot advise illegal activity, if brock and Alex do not know about the coins, they cannot file a suit for possession of them. Issue: Is there any remedy for your growler and coat? Rule: A baliment is created when a bailor entrusts a bailee with a piece of his property with the reasonable expectation that he will receive it back in the same condition.See Allen v Hyatt Analysis: Here, there is a case to be made that a bailment was created when you gave your growler to the bartender. The ticket you receieved back was important because it specified which growler was Issue: Is there any remedy for your growler and coat? Rule: A baliment is created when a bailor entrusts a bailee with a piece of his property with the reasonable expectation that he will receive it back in the same condition.See Allen v Hyatt Analysis: Here, there is a case to be made that a bailment was created when you gave your growler to the bartender. The ticket you receieved back was important because it specified which growler was yours. In the Hyatt case, one of the ideas the court put forth that would create a bailment was if a ticket to park the car had a specified license number on it. The general rule in that case is that there is a spectrum between the creation of a bailment and no creation. If you had your car to a vallet who takes the keys and hands you a ticket to retrieve your car later, a bailment is formed. If you leave your car in an unmanned lot and keep your keys no bailment is formed. Many cases lie in between those. Your growler is very close the valet situation. You gave your growler to a trusted individual- a bartender who fills and returns growlers for a living, received a ticket to return a specific growler back but did not receive it. I believe you could receieve compensation for the growler. The bar may argue that 1. you did not expect to receive it back in the same condition as they were putting beer in it so it would come back in a better condition therefore a bailment does not exist. That's not a strong arguement. 2. They also may argue that it had little value and was an accident so they are not liable. It did however have value to you and it is not their place to decide the value. With your jacket however, there was likely no bailment created because there was clearly no one watching to secure the jackets on the rack. Had it been a coat check, you may have more of an arguement. Conclusion: The court will ikely find a bailment was created for the growler but not for the jacket. Rule: Conversion takes place when one person takes another's rightful possession in a way that the rightful owner no longer has full enjoyment of that item. Analysis: Since you permissively gave your growler to the bartender, I don't believe there was a conversion. Although you could argue that from the moment they didn't return it you revoked that privelege and they were therefore taking your possession and your rightful enjoyment away from you. I bring this up more for the coat. If you found the person who took your coat, you could sue them for conversation. In taking your coat, you lost the rightful enjoyment of wearing your coat and therefore should be compensated for the time you had to live without 11 it. Conclusion: You have rightful grounds to sue the person who took your coat for conversion of conversion. Although you could argue that from the moment they didn't return it you revoked that privelege and they were therefore taking your possession and your rightful enjoyment away from you. I bring this up more for the coat. If you found the person who took your coat, you could sue them for conversation. In taking your coat, you lost the rightful enjoyment of wearing your coat and therefore should be compensated for the time you had to live without it. Conclusion: You have rightful grounds to sue the person who took your coat for conversion of property. Please Keep in Touch! 4) Essay 1 C Issue: What interests exist in the land First grant interests before RAP David has a possessory fee simple subject to executory limitation Frank and fred have an exuctory interest in fee simple Alex has no more interests Rule: In the Rule against Perpetuities, an interest must vest or fail within 21 years after end of all the lives in being at the time of the grant Analysis: The grant to Fred and Frank is invalid under RAP because long after david, fred, frank and alex die, David's heirs could stop using the land for residentual use. The boys interest could potentially vest after 21 years of a life in being. While the court may apply a wait and see approach or a 90 year limit, most jurisdicitions would swipe the part of the grant that creates the invalid interest. Conclusion: In this case, David would have a fee simple absolute over the land and there is nothing Alex can do to limit the land. Second Grant before RAP Edward has a either a fee simple determinable or condition subsequent limit, most jurisdicitions would swipe the part of the grant that creates the invalid interest. Conclusion: In this case, David would have a fee simple absolute over the land and there is nothing Alex can do to limit the land. Second Grant before RAP Edward has a either a fee simple determinable or condition subsequent Alex has either a possibility of reverter or a right of (re)entry Rule: If a fee simple Determinable is violated, the grantor automatically gets the title back. If condition subsequent is violated, the grantor will have to file a suit of ejectment to repossess the land. Analysis: Whether the grant is determinable or condition subsequent, neither apply to the Rule Against Perpatuties so we don't need to apply that. The language ""so long as"" indicates a fee simple determinable because those are words of duration. However, Alex also says he has the right of re-entry which pertains to condition subsquent. Under Marenholtz, the court ruled that when there is ambiguity, a fee simple condition subsquent is prefered. I would advise alex to file for an ejectment if he would like to take the brewery back. "," Issue: Who has claim to the Green acre? Particularly the house? Rule: Adverse possession applies here. To have AP you must satisfy the statute of limitation (here 10 years), show Actual, Continuous, Hostile, Exclusive, and Notorious and Open use of the land. Tieu, Pimental Analysis: Debbie would argue that she, combined with her father's use, satisfies the elements of adverse possession for the land where the house is. Chris and Debbies use of the land was ACTUAL since they claimed ownership, insulated the cabin and debbie built a house on it. For the same reasons, it was OPEN AND NOTORIOUS. So much so in respect to one of the owners, Andrew, he knowingly gave it to Chris. The fact that debbie chose not to visit the land does not negate the open and notorious requirement. She was wilfully ignorant. Their use of the land was also HOSTILE as they did not ask for permission from anyone to use the land. The two tenants that Betty will argue are not satisfied are the Continuous and Exclusive tenets. While Debbie did 11 there continuously, she has only been doing so live for 8 years. in order to satisfy the statute, she must take on the years her father used the land. It is unclear if the cabin that chris lived in is on the same part of the land that Debbie built her house on. OPEN AND NOTORIOUS.

However, Debby could claim that based on customs of the cabin being used for fishing seasons, it is not uncommon for fisherman to own property that they only use part of the year, similar to people with beach houses. The stongest arguement for Betty is that between Chris's death in 2019 and Betty building the house in 2011, it appears that no one used the property. The other tenet that Betty will claim that was not fulfilled was exclusivity. Both Chris and Debbie let neighbors use the land to hunt and fish on. Debbie has established exclusivity on the two acres by here house but again that is only for 8 years. DEbbie will argue that all those guests are permissive and her and her father still claimed exclusive title on the land. Some states have a good faith or bad faith requirement. Good faith means the possessor claims the land truly believing its theirs. Bad faith means the possessor takes the land knowing it isn't theirs. In this case. Chris and Debbie act in good faith Conclusion: The court will likely rule in favor of Betty because, while arguements can be made for both sides on many issues, the 2 year gap after Chris's death clearly violates the continuous rule in Adverse Possesion Issue: Can Debbie claim color of title for the entire? Rule: If one successfully claim's adverse possion on part of the land and has a false title (a title sold to a good faith purchaser that is not actually valid), they can claim title over the entire property Analysis: Here, Chris and Debbie have a false title since Andrew forged Betty's signature on the deed. It should be noted that Tenants in Entiterty cannot unilaterally sever their property. They both must agree to it and betty never did. Conclusion: If Debbie is successful in her AP claim, she could file under color of title for the entire property since she has the false deed. good faith purchaser that is not actually valid), they can claim title over the entire property Analysis: Here, Chris and Debbie have a false title since Andrew forged Betty's signature on the deed.

ee35f056-c741-4d93-9fcf-2a103f9c36d7," Prior to applying RAP: The first child to retire has a contingent remainder in a life estate; the nephew Robert has a vested remainder in a life estate; Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple; and Vivian has a contingent remainder in fee simple. After applying the rule of perpetuities: The RAP applies ot executory interest, vested remainders subject to open, contingent remainders, and option contracts. an interest subjected to RAP must vest or failw ithin 21 years of a life in being alive at the time of conveyance. The polic for RAP is to prevent a a restraint on alienation long after a conveyor's death. Here, the only interest that is not subjected to RAP is Robert becasye a vested remainder is not one of the tradiitonal categories. The first child to retire is invalid since the conveyor could have another child after conveying the grant (lets call her ""X"") and all of the other children could die (Connor and Carla) and X could wait more than 21 years before retiring. Next, typically, Vhe grandchildren's interest would be invalid if the class would not necessarily close prior to the RAP period; however, since Victoe has satisfied the requirements, we can apply the Rule of convenience in which the class has now closed and the interest is valid for all grandchildren alive at the time of the grant; therefore, Victor's interest has vested and Vivian's is contingent on turning 25; however, the unborn grandchildren have no interets in the estate. Therefore, we can now rewrite the interest as: Robert has a present possessry life estate, Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple, and Vivian has a contingent remainder in fee simple. Essay "," 1(a): Brock comes in your office and asks if there are any steps he can take to in his words, ""make some money from this developer."" Explain the nature of his propery interest and the possibilites available to him. The first issue is whether Brock has a joint tenancy with a right of surviviorship or a tenancy in common. Before we consider ways you can make money form the develper, we must first undertsand the nature of the property interest based off of the langauge ""Jointly as tenants in common."" A joint tenancy with a right of survivorship is when co-tenant have a shared undivied and equal interest in a property with the right to use the whole. Upon conveyance of a joint tenancy the langauge must be secific as to a JT and state a right o surivorship in addition to containing the four unities requires (time: conveyed at the same time, title: cotenants get title of the same property, interest: co-tenants have a n undivided eaul interest in the priperty, and possession: co-tenants have an equal interest in possession in the whole). Here the language has not been satisfied to be a JT just by the conveyance of the word ""jointly,"" instead, the court would deafult to tenancy in common. Tenancy in common is the defualt interest fr co-tenants in which each tenant has their own seperate interest in the property but a right to use the whole. Here, the language of ""as tenants in common"" specifies that Broock, you have a tenancy in common, ad due to the payment for half of the business and warehouse site your interest, Broock, is fifty percent, or exactly half which Alex owns the other half. The first possibility available is to consider demandning a payment for rent/profits from third parties from Alex. An ouster is when a co-tenant informs and actually acts as to exclude another tenant from the property. When an ouster or an agrement to pay rent occurs, a cotenant has the right to demand payment for profits from third parties from the land (Martin v. Martin). In Martin, one of the co-tenants with an interest in the property was living on the land rent free and demanded payment from the other co-tenant who did not live on the property for the profits made from the other renting units. The trial court ruled that the co-tenant on the property had to pay rent to the co-tenant that was recieiving profits from the rent. The appellate court reversed and ulitmately held that absent an ouster or an agreement, there is no way the co-tenant not on the property could demand rent from the co-tenant on the property. Broock could argue there is proof of an ouster when Alex said ""get out of here and don't come back"" which can be implied as an intention to remove or 'oust' Broock form the property although they share ownership. Thus, Broock has satisfie the requirement set out in Martin for when a cotenant would like to obtain profits from a third party due to an ouster. Alex may counter that he did not actuall oust Broock because there is no proof that Broock tried to re enter and was actually excluded, but this from the rent. The appellate court reversed and ulitmately held that absent an ouster or an agreement, there is no way the co-tenant not on the property could demand rent from the co-tenant on the property. Broock could argue there is proof of an ouster when Alex said ""get out of here and don't come back"" which can be implied as an intention to remove or 'oust' Broock form the property although they share ownership. Thus, Broock has satisfie the requirement set out in Martin for when a cotenant would like to obtain profits from a third party due to an ouster. Alex may counter that he did not actuall oust Broock because there is no proof that Broock tried to re enter and was actually excluded, but this arguement is weak, and Broock would prevail on his claim of being ousted and demanding payment from Alex. The second possibitiy available is to consider a partition action in-sale by convincing Alex that he could make more money by selling the property. A partition is a court action to either sell off the entire property and split the profits based on interest to the co tenants (in-sale) or to divide the property based on its physical atttributes and divide between the parties (in-kind). Courts in theory prefer a partition in- kind but will do an in-sale when 1) the property's physical attributes make it impossible/improbable to divide and 2) it is not in the best interest of both of the parties (Delfino). Since Alex has made it clear he does not want to sell the property, Broock would need to convince the court that the two elements that would prevent a partition in-kind are available. Broock could creatively argue that the land cannot be in- kind because the brewery and the warehouse, depending on the location, make an in-kind not profitable for Broock since he is attempting to sell his portion of the land to a real estate agent. He may also argue that it is in the ebst interest of both parties because ALex's profits (1 million) would be worth doube of his initial investment of 500,000. Alex has a much strongr argument due to his reliance on teh decision in Defino. Like in the court decision in Delfino, the property culd easily be divided because there are only two parties and it is unlikely a bewery and warehouse take up a significant portion of the entire space; in addition, a court must consider more than just profits and Alex clearly has a sentimental value attached ot the proeprty such that the court will take into consideration to defeat the idea that selling an in-sale is in the ebst interest of both of the parties. Thus, it is likely that by using the Delfino case, Alex has a stronger claim for partition in-kind. The third possibiltiy is for Broock to ask the real estate investor to invest in half the property for a smaller price. The investor would most likely need to build less condos and would give Brock less money, but it may be his best option. 1(b) Dear Carl, The third possibiltiy is for Broock to ask the real estate investor to invest in half the property for a smaller price. The investor would most likely need to build less condos and would give Brock less money, but it may be his best option. 1(b) Dear Carl, I have looked into your case concerning the gold coins, the growler, and the coat. Below, I have outlined what I expect is your best claim to the items and the most likely counterarguements you may receive from other parties. Let me know if there is anything else I can do. Under finder's law, there are five types of interest in items found: 1) Abandoned items are items that have been left behind purposely by the prior owner; the first finder has superior claim 2) lost items are items an owner unintentionally dropped; the first to find them has superior claim over all others except the true owner (Armory) 3) mislaid items are items that an owner misplaces with intent to return to bust has forget where they are; mislainditems belong to the proeprty owner who has superior claim over all but the true owner (Hannah v. Peele; Brenjamin v. Linder Aviation; McAvoy) 4) embedded items are items embedded in the soil whcih theproperty owner has superior claim versus all (Corliss v. Wenner); this is only recongnized in a minrity or districts. 5) treasure trove is when an item of singifciant value is found and the owner is surely dead for a long time; this also is only rcognzed in a shriking number of districts because public policy disfavors the ability for trespassers to claim rights to items by walking on your property. The first issue is whether the gold coins, that you found can remain in your possession. Your best arguement is that the coins are treaure and therefore belong to you. Yo could argue that since the coins are from the late 1800s and such the true owner must be dead. In such case you would have superior right as the finder. However, the the brewery owners could counter that the coins were clearly wrapped in a bag dating ack to a store from only ten years prior such that it is not necessarily true that the owner is dead. The couterargument extends to add that the item should be considered mislaid if not embedded. If this is a jurisdiction that considers embedded, the coins which were embedded into the wall would belong to the propeprty owners (Corliss); however, it is most likely the court will consider the items mislaid. Like in Benjamin v. Linder Abaiation where old coins were found in a plane wing, the coins here have been found in the warehouse wall, and following, the court would hold similarly that the coins had been mislaid and belong to the warehouse and not you, Mr. Carl. The second issue is whether you may recover for the growler. A bailment is a temporary transfer of is dead. The couterargument extends to add that the item should be considered mislaid if not embedded. If this is a jurisdiction that considers embedded, the coins which were embedded into the wall would belong to the propeprty owners (Corliss); however, it is most likely the court will consider the items mislaid. Like in Benjamin v. Linder Abaiation where old coins were found in a plane wing, the coins here have been found in the warehouse wall, and following, the court would hold similarly that the coins had been mislaid and belong to the warehouse and not you, Mr. Carl. The second issue is whether you may recover for the growler. A bailment is a temporary transfer of possessio in which no interest of ownership is conveyed (Allen). A bailment may either be implied through conduct or expressed through contract. Here, you may argue that there was an implied bailment in regard to your growler because unlike in Allen, when only the car was left but it was not in full possession because the keys remainder wiht the bailor, here, the entire possession transferred to the bailee (the abrtender) which is evident throught he transactional ticket. The bartender and warehouse may try to reuttal in that there is an assumed risk in leaving the growler wiht the staff but this is a loser agruement that Carl could easily rebuttal considering he even staisfies the dissent's arguement in Allen that a complete transfer of possession implies a bailment such that when an item is stolen/broken, is is assumed a negligence on the bailee which they carry the burden of proof. The third issue is whether you can recover for the coat under a bailment. The same ruels of bailment would apply as mentioned above such that you may argue that when you left the coat on the hook, there was an implied bailment between you and the brewery. The brewery has a much stornger argument though considering the coat was only lef ton a hook and was not in any sort of protected environment as in Allen. You may counter that the brewery itself is the protected environment similar to the walls of the parking garage in Allen, but this is loser argument and as such, the court would likely side with the brewery that there was no impied bailment. The fourth issue is whether a finder has any right over your coat as an abandoned item. Carl, you would argue that he has lost the coat and thereofre has superior claim over the finder. Like the case in Armory, the court ruled that the finder had superior claim over the shop keeper but not that over the true owner. The finder may argue that the coat was abandoned since Carl after searching said ""forget it."" The court would likely hold that the item was not abandoned because Carl did not place his coat on the rack and then purposefull leave it. His statement, ""forget it"" was only after it had already been lost. 1(c) The first issue is what the conveyance of property to David and to Alex' sons, Frank and Fred. The covneyance, priper to applying RAP is that: David has a fee simple subject to executory limtation and the two sons have a fee simple executory interest in tenancy in common. A fee simple subect to would likely hold that the item was not abandoned because Carl did not place his coat on the rack and then purposefull leave it. His statement, ""forget it"" was only after it had already been lost. 1(c) The first issue is what the conveyance of property is to David and to Alex' sons, Frank and Fred. The covneyance, priper to applying RAP is that: David has a fee simple subject to executory limtation and the two sons have a fee simple executory interest in tenancy in common. A fee simple subect to excutory liitation occurs when a grantor conveys an interest that may be divested/cut short and go to a grantee whihc in this case is Fred and and Frank. The RAP applies ot executory interest, vested remainders subject to open, contingent remainders, and option contracts. an interest subjected to RAP must vest or fail within 21 years of a life in being alive at the time of conveyance. The polic for RAP is to prevent a a restraint on alienation long after a conveyor's death. Here, RAP applies to Frank and fred's executory interest. Their interst will not necessarily vest or fail wihtn a life in being plus 21 years sine the language does not put the duration on a life in being - Dave could never ever us ethe properyt as anythign but for residentil such that it would then vest in his heirs and could extend for hundreds of years; therefore, Fred and Frank's interest are cut from the grant and the language would change to: David has a fee simple determinable and Alex has a posibiltiy of reverter. The second issue is whether due to the fee simple detemrinable, if Alex can reclaim the property once David decided to buld commercial stores as well as residential units. A fee simple detemrinable allows an atuomatic deivestment o the proeprty from the current holder to the grantor when the term of duration occurs. Courts conserder terms of duration ""so long as"" as well as ""only"" (Marenholz). Alex may argue that the onveyance as a fee simple determiabble means that when David changed to a commercial use, Alex now has automatic transfer of the property. David may counter that he is also buolding residential so he still satsfies the condition, but this is a lsoer argument considering Alex's language included the words ""residential uses only."" Thus Alex has title ownership through the posibility of reverter for David's share of the land. The third issue is what the conveyanc of property was to Edward as either a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subect to condition subsequent (FSSCS). A FSSCS is an interest covneyed to a grantee that when a condition has met as signified but the words ""but if"" or ""right of reentry,"" the grantor has the ability to completely divest the property from the grantee and cut short their interest so lond as they actuall enter and do so. Here, Edward would argue that the langauge is of FSSCS because the interest included the language ""right to re-enter and reclaim."" Courts generally prefer a FSSCS due to the rule of construction such that they want to limit court appearances and transfers so that a FSSCS makes it so The third issue is what the conveyanc of property was to Edward as either a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subect to condition subsequent (FSSCS). A FSSCS is an interest covneyed to a grantee that when a condition has met as signified but the words ""but if"" or ""right of reentry,"" the grantor has the ability to completely divest the property from the grantee and cut short their interest so lond as they actuall enter and do so. Here, Edward would argue that the langauge is of FSSCS because the interest included the language ""right to re-enter and reclaim."" Courts generally prefer a FSSCS due to the rule of construction such that they want to limit court appearances and transfers so that a FSSCS makes it so the granotr would actually need to bring action to reclaim rather than automatically tranfer. Alex may counter tht the language ""so long as"" conveys a fee simple determinable, but the courts favorance of the FSSCS make it so that Edward's argumeent would be stronger. The fourth issue is whether Alex may reclaim the property once Edward sold IPA's. Alex may now reenter because he has broken the condition requirement that Edaward must ""never use to make IPAs."" ALex may bring an action to reclaim his property which he wil surely win. "," The first issue is whether Andrew had the ability to transfer his title in Greenacre to Chris. A Tenancy by the Entirety (TBE) is a special co-current ownerhsip between a married coupld that must satisfy the four unities (time: conveyed at the same time, title: cotenants get title of the same property, interest: co- tenants have an undivided eaul interest in the priperty, and possession: co-tenants have an equal interest in possession in the whole) in addition to being married. In addition, a TBE cannot be severed unilaterally. A TBE can only be severed by utual agreement, death, or divorce. Lastly, a TBE would pass from the deceased spouse to the other spouse due to the right of surviorship element. Here, Andrew conveyed interest to Chris in Greenacre by forging Betty's signature. Chris' estate could argue that the transfer was valid because Andrew has the power alienate, but it is a loser arguement since a TBE must be mutually agreedu upon and Andrew has no right to make Betty mutually agree to a conveyance she was not aware of; therefore, the conveyance of title was faulty and Chris' claim to ownership is stronger through arguing claim of title under adverse possession. The second issue is if Debbie has a claim to the property through adverse possession. Adverse possession is when a non-owner may claim ownershipover another's property by satisfying five elements for the statutory period of 10 years. The policy behind adverse possession is to prevent a sleeping owner and to acknowledge the rights of adverse possessors. Courts also use this rule to quiet title disputes when they arise. The five elements of averse possession are: 1) actual - the adverse possessor (""AP"") used the land as an acutal owner would 2) Open and notorious - the AP has used the land in a way that would reasonably put the true owner on notice (Marengo Cave); however, in the case The second issue is if Debbie has a claim to the property through adverse possession. Adverse possession is when a non-owner may claim ownershipover another's property by satisfying five elements for the statutory period of 10 years. The policy behind adverse possession is to prevent a sleeping owner and to acknowledge the rights of adverse possessors. Courts also use this rule to quiet title disputes when they arise. The five elements of averse possession are: 1) actual - the adverse possessor (""AP"") used the land as an acutal owner would 2) Open and notorious - the AP has used the land in a way that would reasonably put the true owner on notice (Marengo Cave); however, in the case of a minor encroachment, a court could force judicial sale if forcing the AP to remove from the premises would not be reasonable and in such cases the AP has to pay for the value of the land they adversly possessed (Mannillo) 3) Exclusive - the AP must retaint he ability to exclude others from the property (Tieu; Marengo) 4) Continuously - the AP must use adversly for the entire satutory period, but if the adverse possessor changes, they may ""tack"" so long as they still adversely possess the same land (Tieu) 5) Hostile - the AP must not ask for permission to be on the property and the majority rule is that an AP must only be objectively hostile (Cahill) but a minority of jurisidctions hod that an AP must hae subjective good faith (Tieu) or bad faith (Maine jurisidction). In addition, an AP may claim the entire property when they obtain a color ot title. A color of title is when the AP obtains a faulty deed which they in good faith believe to be real. In the case of color of title, the AP has right over the entire property absent an owner actually residing on the land. Continuous requirement: Debbie will argue that she had continuous posesson that may ""tack"" from Chris' possession that started in 2001 when he obtained the faulty deed. Debbie would argue that similar to Tieu, she used the property adversely from the prior owner for the same land. Betty would counter that the ownership was not continuous because the title transfer ocured in 2009 but Debbie did not start fully residing on the property until 2011. This would leave 2-3 years of the property not adversly possessed by anyone. The court would need to look into evidence as to whether Betty, although not on the property ""full-time"" still went to the property for at least some time between 2009 and 2011. It is liekly based on the language of the facts presented that Debbie was not on the land during that time and she therefore, had to resatisfy the statutory period beginning in 2011 which would run until 2021. Even if Debbie wanted to argue that the period should've ended in 2011 since Chris obtained the property in 2001, her argument would not be valid sinc someone would need to be on the proeprty during the years 2009 and 2010. Actual requirment: Debbie would argue that she had actual ownership because she had a house on the land and had a the facts presented that Debbie was not on the land during that time and she therefore, had to resatisfy the statutory period beginning in 2011 which would run until 2021. Even if Debbie wanted to argue that the period should've ended in 2011 since Chris obtained the property in 2001, her argument would not be valid sinc someone would need to be on the proeprty during the years 2009 and 2010. Actual requirment: Debbie would argue that she had actual ownership because she had a house on the land and had a graden shuch that she was acting as a typical owner would on the property. Betty would have no strong argument against this but may counter that she was not actual becasue her usage of the property by living in the house was different than the intended usage of hunting. The intedned usage of the property is irrelevant and Debbie must only satisfy actual through usage as any owner would use property; therefore, Debbie liekly satisfies the actual requirment. Open and notorious: Debbie would argue that she is open and notorious because she built on the property and changed the landscape. Although she did not use all 50 acres, her use was enough to show that she was present on the property. Unlike in Marengo where the adverse possessor would not let the true owner survey the property of the ave, Betty was free to visit and if she had, she would've seen Debbie on the land. Betty may argue that Debbie was only a minor enroachment because 2 cres out of 50 is relatively small especially considering how vastly wooded the area was. Like the court in Manillo noted, there is a strong plocy against forcing owners to police their land constantly. If Betty's arguement were to suceed, Debbie could most likely argue that the court like in Manillo should issue a forced judicial sale since depriing her of her house and livlihood would be difficult since she lives there now full-time. Exclusive: Debbie has a very strong arguement in favor of excusivity since she granted permission to hunters who wanted to use the land as did Chris when he was adversely possession the land. Hostile: Debbie never asked for permission to use the land and there is no objective manifestation to prove otherwise as required in Cahill. Unlike the adverse possessor in Cahill who asked to buy the land, Debbie has never questioned her ownership based on the facts given. Betty may coutner that the court should apply a subjective test as required in Tieu where the adverse possessor must act in good faith; however, even if the court used this rational, there is no proof that Debbie had a subjective bad faith or that she though to ask permission for the land. Hostile: Debbie never asked for permission to use the land and there is no objective manifestation to prove otherwise as required in Cahill. Unlike the adverse possessor in Cahill who asked to buy the land, Debbie has never questioned her ownership based on the facts given. Betty may coutner that the court should apply a subjective test as required in Tieu where the adverse possessor must act in good faith; however, even if the court used this rational, there is no proof that Debbie had a subjective bad faith or that she though to ask permission for the land. The next issue is what amount of land coud Debbie recover in an action if she has sucessfully satisifed the five elements of adverse possession. A color of title is when the AP obtains a faulty deed which they in good faith believe to be real. In the case of color of title, the AP has right over the entire property absent an owner actually residing on the land. Here, Debbie could argue that the true owner was not residing on the property during the statutory period and therfore she has claim over all 50 acres. Betty would argue that Debbie cannot recover becasue she only occupied two however, the color of title rules would negat theis argument. Overall, it is unlikely that Debbie will succeed in adverse possession despite her claim through color of title because she must satisfy all five element so of adverse possession to acquire ownership whereas here it is clear that she has only satisfied four; therefore, Betty has superior claim because the TBE passess iterest to the surviving spouse.

Vivian will have a CR as she needs to reach 25 years old before the conveyance vests RAP is applied for future interests. The future interest that are subject to RAP are Contingent Remainders, Vested Remainders subject to Open, and Executory Interests. RAP is valid when there is a time limit, the conveyance vests at the death or meeting of a certain event of a validating life, and if it does not vest at death or an event, then 21 years after death. RAP is valid from Connor and Carla as the conveyance will vest when either of them retires first. RAP is valid for Robert as the conveyance will vest when the first child to retires dies. RAP is valid for Victor as the conveyance will vest upon Robert's death and he is already above 25. RAP is invalid for Vivian as Robert could die before she turns 25 and thus the conveyance will never vest for her. It is better to say ""then to my grandchildren."" Since two grandchildren already exist at the time of the grant, the Rule of Convenience (ROC) can be used to close the potentially open class. The class would ""officially close"" when Oliver has no more children and all his children die at which point the number of grandchildren will be definite...using the ROC allows to avoid potential additions or confusion and thus can be used here to close the class as it is already presented. 2) "," ISSUE: The issue here is what property interest Brock holds as a co-tenant of the land with his brother Alex and what Brock can do with these interests as related to his desire to ""make money from the developer"". RULE: TIC is the default for co-ownership unless the contrary is expressly expressed. TIC can be divested, granted, and inherited. Tenants in common have fractional interest as related to money and undivided interest to the rights of ownership in the entire parcel. TIC is the default option when there is ambiguity. Ambuigity usually arises when there is more than one person and there is not an express intent of the estate. ANALYSIS/ CONCLUSION: As a TIC with his brother, Brock has a fractional interest in the land in monetary terms and an undivided interest in rights of ownership to the entire parcel. It is possible that one could argue that there is ambiguity in Alex's deed but this still defaults the tenancy to a tenancy in common. Thus, Brock and Alex are TIC. As a TIC, Brock does have the right to sell his portion of the land. However, this case, similar to the one about the garbage buisness, creates several issues. First, Alex derives a livilhood from his brewery buisness. Second, he has an emotional and financial investment in the buisness. Third, it would be very difficult to physically divide the land if Brock was to sell his piece (not to mention that the develpor wishes to buy all 10 acres as well as the warehouse not just a portion of the land). Fourth, if Alex were forced to participate in a sale of the land, it is very possible that he would be significantly damaged by this sale. While perhaps not monetarily, as the broker is offering $2m for the sale, (although there is neither any information on how this $2m would be divided amongst Alex and Brock nor an assurance that the sale would actually be $2m), it is much more likely that Alex could be emotionally damaged from the sale. He is incredibly invested - it has been his dream to run a brewery afterall. Even so, Alex could perhaps argue that his financial investment in the brewery are significant to him and that the sale would hurt him. If Alex were to sell the land and follow Brock's idea of moving the brewery, there is no way of knowing if this would be as successful as it is now. Many issues arise - what would be the cost of moving a brewery? How long until the new buisness matched the old buisness, if ever? How long would it take to set up a new brewery? Thus, Alex could argue that although, $2m could result from the sale and he could receive a respectable portion of the likely that Alex could be emotionally damaged from the sale. He is incredibly invested - it has been his dream to run a brewery afterall. Even so, Alex could perhaps argue that his financial investment in the brewery are significant to him and that the sale would hurt him.

Thus, Alex could argue that although, $2m could result from the sale and he could receive a respectable portion of the $2m, it would not be enough to replace what he has now. Finally, although a small point, but one to note, it is likely that all the people who work at the brewery would lose their jobs and more likely than not, would not benefit monetarily from the sale to the brocker. In this case, if Brock wishes to proceed, a partition in kind would probably be unlikely to be granted by the court, even though it is the preferred court option. The court could proceed with a partition by sale as the nature of the case fits such a sale (hard to split land equally and sale of land would result in damage to one pary). In such a case, the court would rule for a sale of the entire land and split up the profits amongst Alex and Brock equally. However, just like the garbage disposal case, because Alex has such a significant emotional connection and monetary investment, the court would ultimately not rule in such a manner. In such a case, Brock could seek to receive the fair market value of his share of the land from his brother Alex. 3) <QUESTION id='Q1' tell=""Question 1 - Part 1B ""> <![CDATA[ Dear Mr. Carl Cask, The issue at hand here is whether you have a right to the coins you found on the property and whether you can seek any damages for your lost coat and lost growler. In regards to the coins, found propety there are five types of property: missing propety, embedded property, treasure trove, abandoned property, and lost property. Your case is likely to fall under embedded property as the coins were wrapped up in a bag and at the base of the warehouse wall. A similar case, where coins were found wrapped underneath a driveway and second where they were found in the wing of a plane also found the coins 4toofbe8 embedded. Although you found these embedded coins yourself, they were on the breweries property thus, like the driveway and plane case, the coins will likely go to the brewery/land owners. However, it is possible that the court would rule that In regards to the coins, found propety there are five types of property: missing propety, embedded property, treasure trove, abandoned property, and lost property. Your case is likely to fall under embedded property as the coins were wrapped up in a bag and at the base of the warehouse wall. A similar case, where coins were found wrapped underneath a driveway and second where they were found in the wing of a plane also found the coins to be embedded. Although you found these embedded coins yourself, they were on the breweries property thus, like the driveway and plane case, the coins will likely go to the brewery/land owners. However, it is possible that the court would rule that you could get a finder's fee for finding the coins. You could potentially argue that the coins were there before the brewery owners bought the property (the coins were wrapped up in a bag from a local grocery store that opened ten years ago and could have been there since the store opened which would mean before Alex bought the propery) we currently do not have information on when the coins were left in the brewery's wall. Thus, this arguement would likely not stand in court. Your second issue in regards to your growler and lost coat may be more favourable. In this case you are a bailor, and the brewery is the bailee. In other words, you as the bailor entrusted the brewery with your personal property and as a result, the brewery, as a bailor, has a reasonable duty of care over your items. For both items, a court is likely to find the brewery as having an implied bailment. You came on their property, likely in an enclosed space, and where given a claim ticket for your growler and provided with coat hooks for your coat. Thus, the brewery took steps to form an implied bailement over your items just like the Hyatt hotel garage case. In regards to your growler, you can seek restitution from the bailee (the brewery). In regards to your coat, we will have to investigate the scenario a bit more. If someone stole your coat (purposefully or accidentally) you could seek resitution from thief. I recommend if this is the case, you do so before the brewery if they choose to seek restitution for this stolen item because the thief can only be made to pay one time. However, the brewery does this first, you can seek restituion from the brewery. Alternateively, you can seek you can seek resittution from the brewery directly. It is possible that the brewery counters this arguement by the fact that you had a personal responsbility over your items, your growler for example, being so sentiemental, could have stayed home and you were given a claim ticket for it. Furthermore, while your coat was on a hook, you could have paid attention to it while it was hanging. Nonetheless, it is likely that a court will find in your favour. Sincerly, could have paid attention to it while it was hanging. Nonetheless, it is likely that a court will find in your favour. Sincerly, QUESTION 1- PART 1D DAVID David has an executory limitation and Alex's two sons have a shifiting executroy interest. If David goes through with his plan he will lose the rights he had been given by Alex and the interest will shift over to Alex's two sons. David wil no loner have a right to the land. EDWARD Edward has an executory limitation and Alex maintains a right of entry/power of termination. Edward has now violated the terms of the deed set forth by Alex. As such, Edward may loses his right to the land Alex had given him in the deed. Alex can now freely terminate the deee he held with Edward. "," Andrew and Betty are TBE. A TBE is a JT (has all the 4 unities of a JT, time, title, intention, and possession) and the element of marriage. In a TBE, neither party is allowed to unilaterraly sever. A severance can occur either by the persmission of the other spouse or by mutual agreement of both parties, death or divorce. At first, Andrew sells the land to Chris under color of title. This means that Chris obtains the land in question under a defective instrument. The defect here is that Andrew, holding a TBE in Greenacre with his wife Betty, cannot sell the land as he a) does not have the permission of Betty to do so or b) Betty has not mutually agreed, they have not divorced, and neither of them have passed and of course, c) he forges her signature on the sale documents. Under these circumstances, Chris has obtained Greenacre under color of title (COT). However, things change when Andrew dies in 2004. Andrew's death signals a severance in the TBE he question under a defective instrument. The defect here is that Andrew, holding a TBE in Greenacre with his wife Betty, cannot sell the land as he a) does not have the permission of Betty to do so or b) Betty has not mutually agreed, they have not divorced, and neither of them have passed and of course, c) he forges her signature on the sale documents. Under these circumstances, Chris has obtained Greenacre under color of title (COT). However, things change when Andrew dies in 2004. Andrew's death signals a severance in the TBE he holds with his wife Betty. While Chris has come to own the title to the land under a defective instrument, a court might find Andrew's death and thus the ""destruction"" of the TBE he held with Bettey to be in Chris's favour. While COT is a defective instrument, one can still gain possession of the land through adverse posession (AP), which necessitates meeting five elements, hostile, open and notorious, exclusive, acutal, and contitious for the statutory period. Furthermore, one's AP period can be tacked on to another person's AP period when done knowingly and voluntarily. Debbie's Arguements: Debbie can argue that she and her father have satisfied the elements for AP. Chris went there consectively for 8 weeks a year for 8 years, walked around the woods, and enlarged and insulated the house. It could further be found that him leaving his land to Debbie was a form of knowingly and volunarily tacking on his AP period to Debbie's. Debbie furthers her AP and meeting the 5 elements by deciding to live there year round and building a year-round house. While she does not venture beyond her two acres around her house, she has tended to the land she does reside on signficantly (house improvement and her ""lovely formal garden""). She also clearly prevents hunters from entering the property on where the house she resides on sits as well as the 2 acres around it which Debbie can further argue in her favour for mainting the 5 elements of AP. Finally, like the case of the shared driveway, Debbie could argue that she and her father, although they obtained the land under a defective instrument did so mistakenly and in good faith. Betty's Arguements: Betty can first argue that the sale of the land was done improperly, both for the forged signature and the fact that she held a TBE with her husband while he performed the sale. As she did not give her permission, mutually agree, was alive and not divorced with Andrew at the time, she can argue for defective sale. Furthermore, Betty can argue that the AP possession of the land both by Betty and Chris does not fit the necessary five elements. Although the statute of limitations period for AP in this Betty's Arguements: Betty can first argue that the sale of the land was done improperly, both for the forged signature and the fact that she held a TBE with her husband while he performed the sale. As she did not give her permission, mutually agree, was alive and not divorced with Andrew at the time, she can argue for defective sale. Furthermore, Betty can argue that the AP possession of the land both by Betty and Chris does not fit the necessary five elements. Although the statute of limitations period for AP in this jurisdiction is not known, Betty could say that Chris's time on the property was not continous within the requiste statutory period. She may also argue this for Debbie given that Debbie only started to fully reside on Greenacre in 2011 (8 years) and that from when she obtained the proeprty in 2009 to 2011, she was not living there full-time. Furthermore, Betty could argue that the tacking on of Chris's AP period was not proper tacking. Chris did not know he obtained Greenacre under COT and thus, did not know he was AP so, he did not knowingly and voluntarily tack on his AP period to Debbie's. Betty can also argue that both Chris and Debbie always allowed other people to enter Greenacre for the entire time since they had a ""title"" to the land (started out as defective). Additionally, Betty could argue that Debbie resdies on a small portion of the 50 acres of Greenacre and thus, it is not enough to constitute proper AP of all of Greenacre. Finally, if Betty truly believes that Greenacre is her own and not Debbie's, she could argue that Debbie has been trespassing on her property and Betty has the right to exclude her. ",331,1604,942

Oliver Owner is the grantor in this situation because he is the one granting his property to someone else. The present possessory interests here is that when oliver states ""to the first of my children to retire , for life""that is a life estate however is does not work because none of his two children connor and carla are able to recieve it becuase they both work at the time of the conveyance thus it is then passed onto his nephew rob based on the langauge""then to my nephew robert for life"" it makes oliver have a life estate and then when oliver states ""then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25"" that is a future interest for the granchildren vicotr and vivian becuase they are not able to get in until the life estate of rob ends which will be when he dies thus the grandchildren have to wait becuase they both have remainders which cannot cut or dives. The future interest that the grandson victor has is a remainder vested subject to open becuase while he has reached the age requirement of 25( he is 26) it is open becuase there is the possibility that the grandaughter vivian who is only 17 will reach the age of 25 and thus change the class size by being added into it if she reaches the age requirement. Thus, vivian has a vested remainder subject to divestmenet becuase she needs to reach the age of 25 in order to be able to recieve the property. "," 1A: The issue here is whether Brock is able to recieve any money from the developer when it comes to the property of where the brewery is on. According the the rule(as seen in sprague) because brock has a joint tenant with his brother he will not be able to sell the property but he would be able to sell his porition of the joint tenant to the developer. Because he is a joint tenant with this brother , Alex, he is not able to sell the property as a whole without the mutual agreement of his brother which is most likely not going to happen becuase of the strong feelings alex has about the brewery and wanting to keep it running. In a joint tenant the biggest takeaway from it 8is that you have an equal right or share of the use of the property with any of the other cotenants unless there is an outser but this is not the case in our situation thus, because it is off equal use and all tenant are able to use the property, one tenant is not joint tenant with his brother he will not be able to sell the property but he would be able to sell his porition of the joint tenant to the developer. Because he is a joint tenant with this brother , Alex, he is not able to sell the property as a whole without the mutual agreement of his brother which is most likely not going to happen becuase of the strong feelings alex has about the brewery and wanting to keep it running. In a joint tenant the biggest takeaway from it is that you have an equal right or share of the use of the property with any of the other cotenants unless there is an outser but this is not the case in our situation thus, because it is off equal use and all tenant are able to use the property, one tenant is not able to sell the property without the agreement of the others. This is seen in the Sprague case where the court held that a cotenant is able to grant their portion of the property to another (rights of surviorship) but it does not take away the right or portition from the other orignal cotenant. Here in our situation, Alex would be able to give the developer his portion, but the developer would not be able to make any changes of the property without the mutual agreement of alex thus, while Brock can try to make some of a profit by offering to sell his portion of the joint tenant , it is likely the developer will say no becuase they would not be able to make changes without alex's permission which will be difficult becuase he is th one who wants to continue the brewery buisness thus favoring in Alex. However, there can be a sitaution favoring the developer if he is to buy the portion of Brocks interest of the joint tenancy and then go to court asking for the court to enter into a judgement to either a partion by kind or partion by sale. Courts have typically as seen in the case Delfino (the garbage collectoing buisness) ruled and prefer to rule in for a partion by kind becuase it is giving equal in the land to both parties and is fair to both sides. However, most times the court will rule in favor of partition by sale if there are two elements meet (the physcial property and the value are so grand that the court will sell the land and split the proceeds based off the percentange each cotenant had in that sold land) . In this case, if the developer once becomes a joint tenant with alex will most likely ask the court to rule in favor of parition in kind becuase of several reasons , first, the property is 10 acres which can be easily split evenly and second, the reason the devleoper expressed an interest to Brock was for the property in which they want to use for future home developments thus, giving the developer some of the property instead of non. Overall, it is likely that the developer will not buy brock porition of the concurrent tenant becuase of the pushback and nonwillingness he would face with Alex who owns and has just as much of a right to use and rights of the property becuase in the orgianal creatation of the joint tenants all of the four elements where all the cotenants must have created at the same time with the same elements statisifed in the creation ( possession,title, time and instrumenet) resulting in the joint tenants to have equal use and rights to the property. Overall, it is likely that the developer will not buy brock porition of the concurrent tenant becuase of the pushback and nonwillingness he would face with Alex who owns and has just as much of a right to use and rights of the property becuase in the orgianal creatation of the joint tenants all of the four elements where all the cotenants must have created at the same time with the same elements statisifed in the creation ( possession,title, time and instrumenet) resulting in the joint tenants to have equal use and rights to the property. 1B: The first issue here is whether Carl has an legal claim to the gold coins he has founded at the brewery when he was there. The answer is no, the gold coins where discovered from a small hole at the base of the warehouse wall thus showing it was embedded into the building of the brewery, this is a clear example of embedded property(or treasure trove but is no longer used as common) . Becuase this is embedded property the common law rule for embedded property as seen in corliss ( coins found by the excavator) is that it goes to the property owner of where the embedded property was found thus, the coins should go to Alex and Brock who are the owners of the property. While, Carl may argue that becuase the coins has the name of a local grocery store that oncee owned and operated on that property ten years prior and thus should go to that store that is irrelevant becuase at the time when carl found it, it was on the brewery. While carls, arguement about the grocery store mislaying the property even if that was the case, alex and brock would still have a superior claim to the coins over carl becuase based off the rule of mislaid property as found in Medina( purse found at the barbershop) the property owner (or store owner as seen in medina ) has the right over the person who found it until the true owner returns for it , if they every do. However, it is likely that the court will rule that the coins where found as mislaid property and will give the ownership to the property owners Alex and Brock. The second issuse is regarding carl's growler and jacket , both items that went missing and whether if found is he able to take repossesion of them, the answer is yes. While, the growler possibly was broken if it turns out the growler was simply misplaced he has the superior right of the growler becuase he is the true owner of the item. Mislaid property as ruled in medina , the true owner has the superior right to the mislaid property and if not reclaimed it is given to the store or property owner where the item was found. In this case, becuase Carl is the true owner of the growler when it was gifted to him, if the growler is found to have been mislaid then carl can claim that he is the true owner and the court will rule in his favor granting him the possession of the growler. However, there is the counteragruement avaible that when carl leaves without the growler and just decideds to leave if that growler is ever the finder of the growlwer can state that becauase carly willingly left that he adbandoned the property and that the true owner of the item. Mislaid property as ruled in medina , the true owner has the superior right to the mislaid property and if not reclaimed it is given to the store or property owner where the item was found. In this case, becuase Carl is the true owner of the growler when it was gifted to him, if the growler is found to have been mislaid then carl can claim that he is the true owner and the court will rule in his favor granting him the possession of the growler. However, there is the counteragruement avaible that when carl leaves without the growler and just decideds to leave if that growler is ever the finder of the growlwer can state that becauase carly willingly left that he adbandoned the property and that the finder has the right to keep it . In the somewhat similar sitaution is the third issue when it comes to carl's jacket and who has claim to the jacket.In favor for carl the facts would show that jacket is an issue of stolen property becuase carl placed it on the coat rack and once he turned to the coatrack to retrieve it and looks multiple times to see his coat is no longer there showing it has been stolen. If the court would rule in favor of Carl based on the jacket being stolen they would use the reasoning that stolen property will always be found to go back to the rightful owner of the item. However, if someone found the jacket and argued that when Carl stated ""forget it "" it can be considered abdanonded property then the court based off that arguemenet would rule in favor of the finder of the item becuase when carl abdandoned the jacket he did not care for it or where it would end up. 1C When Alex (the grantor in this situation ) gave david, the real estate developer the 5 vacant acres of land in a deed (meaning he was still alive at the time of the conveyance) by stating ""To David, so long as the property is used for resudential uses only, if it is ever used for non-residental uses, then to my two sons frank and fred."" David who is the grantee becuase he is the one recieving it from the grantor Alex, had a fee simple subject to a condition subsquent . It was a fee simple becuase there was no language state ""for life"" thus not making it a life estate. It then became a subject to condition subsequent becuase Alex placed the condition of ""so long as the property is used for resudential uses only, if it is ever used for non-residental uses"" thus showing that Alex did not have to do anything in order to recieve it but that if he violates the condition placed then he loses it thus making it a condition subsequent. If david violates it alex states that it will then go to ""then to my two sons frank and fred."" This means that Frank and Fred have in the orginial statment a executory interest in fee simple becuase there is the condition precedent that david needs to violate it in order for frank and fred to receive it. That is the orginal statement Alex gave when first giving the 5 acres however,when david violated the terms becuase he decided to use the property for also commerical stores and no longer just residental ever used for non-residental uses"" thus showing that Alex did not have to do anything in order to recieve it but that if he violates the condition placed then he loses it thus making it a condition subsequent. If david violates it alex states that it will then go to ""then to my two sons frank and fred."" This means that Frank and Fred have in the orginial statment a executory interest in fee simple becuase there is the condition precedent that david needs to violate it in order for frank and fred to receive it. That is the orginal statement Alex gave when first giving the 5 acres however,when david violated the terms becuase he decided to use the property for also commerical stores and no longer just residental use he loses the rights and it is now given to fred and frank. Alex has no claim in the property anymore because once he conveyed it to fred and frank in a exectuory interest in fee simple he gave it to them and will stay with them forever or if they die in their will or future family becuase a fee simple is indefinte. When alex (still the grantor in this case) gave the other 5 acres to edward, the grantee,in a deed m (meaning he was still alive) stated ""to edward and his heirs so long as the premises are never used to make IPA, and if IPAs are ever made on the premises Alex has the right to re-enter and reclaim the premises."" In this statement edward has a fee simple (becuase it is not stating for life thus not making it a life estate meaning the only other present possessory interest can be a fee simple) subject to condition subsequent because it states a duration of time when saying ""so long as the premises are never to be used to make IPA"" stating that the terminology restricting the fee simple is that of a contingency. If edward violates the contingency then it is stated that Alex has the right to re-enter and reclaim the premises"" this means that alex has a future interest in the land as right of entry becuase if the future interest is held in the grantor and the present possessory is a fee simple subject to condition subsquent then the future interets will always be a right of entry (but only if it is the future interest in the grantor). Edward violates the contingency placed on his fee simple when he decided the brew IPA meaning that he loses the possessory interest and it goes back to Alex becuase it is stated in the conveyance however, becuase alex has a right of entry that means he needs to physcially go and take the 5 acres back himself. "," The issue here is who has claim to the property known as greenacre. When it comes to the claims that can be made by betty she will state that becuase she owned the property with her husban chris by tenants by entirety he was not able to make the decision to sell 3) The issue here is who has claim to the property known as greenacre. When it comes to the claims that can be made by betty she will state that becuase she owned the property with her husban chris by tenants by entirety he was not able to make the decision to sell greenacre to chris without her permission becuase they own a 50/ 50 share of the concurrent interest. Betty will then argue that even just based off that fact he was not legally suppose to do that she has more of a stronger claim that adding that once he died the concurrent interest became fully hers through the form of rights of surviorship which states that if the one cotenant does not deed, convey , or in a will leave their interest to a stated specific person then it will go to entirety to the the other cotenant in the tenancy by entirety which would be betty. Becuase they never divorced before to severe the tenants by entirey but it just ended when he died thus making it a joint tenant which has the same rule of rights of surviorship then the full concurrent interest will go to betty. Betty will also argue that because chris violated the elements needed to satisfy AP as stated in pimental then that debbie is not able to AP the property as well. betty will state that chris violated the elements of AP becuase he did not continously live on the property for the ten years needed becuase he would only go to greenacre for eight weeks a year violating the continous element of AP which states in order for AP to apply the Adverse possessor needs to have lived on the property contintious without times of leaving based on whatver the statue of limitations is for it which is this case is 10 years, because of this betty will state that debbies claim of her father AP the property thus making the conveyncing valid will actually be invalid. Plus, debbie will not be able to argue that she can tack on the years becuase that is not allowed unless there is a verbal mutal agreement to that privity which was not because they never agreeded to that but that just chris leaving greenacre is not enough to statisfy the privity to tack on the years to satsify the statue of limitations. When it comes to the claims that can be made by Debbie, she will claim that she honestly that she had the property through a good faith purchase and that because neither her nor her father knew of the forgery that she should be able keep the property or at least the 2 acres that she currently uses and occupies. If good faith does not satisfy the courts she can argue that her father obtained the property due to adverse possession and that she satisfied the requirements of AP in that becuase her dad satisfied that the property became his and thus making him able to transfer it to her upon his death becuase once the AP was satisfied he was able to transsfer it beause it became his property like any When it comes to the claims that can be made by Debbie, she will claim that she honestly that she had the property through a good faith purchase and that because neither her nor her father knew of the forgery that she should be able keep the property or at least the 2 acres that she currently uses and occupies. If good faith does not satisfy the courts she can argue that her father obtained the property due to adverse possession and that she satisfied the requirements of AP in that becuase her dad satisfied that the property became his and thus making him able to transfer it to her upon his death becuase once the AP was satisfied he was able to transsfer it beause it became his property like any other real property in the eyes of the law. Here debbie will claim that she recieved the property through her father who had thought he has in good faith claimed the property becuase he did not know that bettys signature was forged by her husband andrew. While it seems that betty has the overall greater arguement it is likely that the court will likely rule that debbie can keep the two acres she has lived on with color of title becuase while the title looked to be good in reality (her father did not know it was forged but in reality it was) it was not and that it was a good faith mistake. the purpose of the color of title is to give a balance to the two parties which can be done here by giving debbie the 2 acres she actually uses since she doesnt use the whole 50 acres and giving the rest of the 48 acres to betty who was the true owner. the color of title is to help give a benefit to the party who recieved the color of title who is also recieving a deteriment even though it was not based off their mistake.

"," 1A Hi Brock, thank you for stopping by my office to inquire about how you can make some money off the developers offer, and the nature of your property interest in the estate in question. You and your brother share a Tenancy in Common, meaning you both own a share of the brewery and each maintain your own equal, individual rights. For example, you and Alex may not charge eachother rent, unless you have been ousted by the other. That being said, you are free to convene your interest through privity with another party, but can not force Alex to do to the same. If you were seeking to make profit off your interest in the brewery, and end your tenancy in common with your brother, you may do so by a partion in kind, or a partition by sale. In a partition by sale, the entire property would be sold and you and your brother would split the owelty fairly, whereas in a partion in kind, you would only be selling your share a Tenancy in Common, meaning you both own a share of the brewery and each maintain your own equal, individual rights.

In a partition by sale, the entire property would be sold and you and your brother would split the owelty fairly, whereas in a partion in kind, you would only be selling your portion of the property. Because Alex runs his buisness off the land, and has invested time, money, and energy, it is unlikely that a court will mandate a partion by sale, as it wont be equitable to your brother. 1B Hi Carl, thank you for stopping by my office to inquire about your legal rights regarding the gold coins you found, as well as your lost growler, and coat. Lets begin with the gold coins, typically when an individual finds lost property, they have a superior claim to all else except the rightful original owner. However, because you found the gold coins in the wall of the brewery warehouse, it is likely that Alex and Brock will argue the courts reasoning in Corliss v. Wenner, where the court ruled that property owners have contructive possession of all items secreted or hidden on their property. While you may argue the coins are a treasure trove, and therefore you have ownership as the finder, courts have been hesitant to apply the treasure trove doctrine because it is contrary to modern notions of fairplay, and encourages trespassers to hunt for gold wherever they may. Also, becuase you found the gold coins in a relatively modern/new bag, the brewery owners could simply argue the gold was mislaid property, in which case they would owe a duty of care to hold the gold in anticipation of the rightful owner to return (Medina v. McCavoy). It is highly unlikely that a court would award you possession of the coins, but you may argue to Alex and Brock directly for a reward for finding them. That being said, it appears you did create a bailment relationship with the brewery when you a gave them your growler. A bailment is when a property owner (bailor) gives their property to another (bailee) for a service or cost, and is entitled to certain rights. In such cases, the bailee owes the bailor a duty of care to protect their property. For a bailment to be present, the bailee must have total control/possession over the chattel in question (Allen v. Hyatt). When the bartender took your growler, and in return gave you a ticket, a bailment relationship formed becuase the bartneder, acting as an agent of the brewery, took complete possession of your property and in turn, owed you a duty of care, in this case, returning your growler full with beer. If in fact, the bartneder broke your growler, you may seek damages for the destroyed property. You may apply the same reasoning as it relates to your coat, however, the brewery may argue that they never had complete possession of your coat becuase you volutarily left it on a coat rack. In property. For a bailment to be present, the bailee must have total control/possession over the chattel in question (Allen v. Hyatt). When the bartender took your growler, and in return gave you a ticket, a bailment relationship formed becuase the bartneder, acting as an agent of the brewery, took complete possession of your property and in turn, owed you a duty of care, in this case, returning your growler full with beer. If in fact, the bartneder broke your growler, you may seek damages for the destroyed property. You may apply the same reasoning as it relates to your coat, however, the brewery may argue that they never had complete possession of your coat becuase you volutarily left it on a coat rack. In this case, your coat would be mislaid property, where you would maintain your claim to the jacket, and the brewery, as the property owners, would owe you a duty to safekeep your jacket if they found it. To recap, you have may seek damages for your growler, and independently ask for a reward for finding the gold coins, but a court will unlikely award you possession of the coins or damages for the lost jacket. 1C Hi Alex, thank you for stopping by to inquire about your property rights as it relates to David and Edward. It appears you conveyed to David a fee simple determinable and springing executory interests in Frank and Fred, also, you conveyed a feel simple determinable to Edward while retaining a right of entry. Beginning with Davids conveynance, in using words of duration, 'so long as', you granted David a fee simple determinable, in this case, when David began planning to use the property for commercial retail, the property automatically shifted to Frank and Fred, who then had fee simple absolutes in the property. Your conveyance to Edward, however, is rather ambigous, you use the same words of duration, but the ""right of reentry"" you maintain is correlated to a fee simple subject to conditions subsequent, not a fee simple determinable, because of this ambiguity, a court will likely rule the grant was a fee simple subject to conditions subsequent because it favors the current property owner. As a result, your right of entryt will not be automatic, you will need to take legal measures to regain title to Edwards conveyance. "," The issue is the merits of legal claims available to Betty and Debbie as it relates to greenacre. The main argument which can be made by Betty is that as she never consented to signing the property to Chris, his title was not good, and neither is Debbies. However, Debbie may counter this claim saying that she has a color of title and has acquired all of the property through Adverse possession. Debbie fulfilled all the requirments of adverse possession [Actual, exclusive, open and notorious, continous, and hostile].

Although Betty may say Debbie herself did not live on the land for the full 10-year requirement, Debbie can argue that the time Chris owned Greenacre should be tacked to her time on the land, as explicated in Tieu v. Morgan. Also, Debbie required permission by hunters to enter the 2 acers around her house, showing more exclusivily, as well as open and notorious. As a result, it is likely that a court will rule Greenacre was adverse possessed by Debbie, and becawse she was acting under color of title, she will get all 50 acers. ",168,1150,331
310ea7b9-393e-4af8-9dcf-0e687e7daf45," The first of Oliver's child to retire has a life estate, however since both Connor and Carla are working and it is unknown when either one with retire the rule of perpetuities applies to both of them since they can both retire after 21 years of conveyance, thus, their interest in the property is void. The new grants would then be rewritten to say ""to my nephew Robert of life, then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25,"" meaning that Robert now has a current possession of the property as a life estate, and Victor has a vested remainder subject to partial divestment in fee simple since he is 26 at the time of conveyance. However, Victor's interest in the property is subject to partial divestment since the grant states notes that all grandchildren who reach the age of 25 have an interest in the property, and since Vivian is 17 at the time of conveyance she will turn 25 within a 21 year period, thus, making her interst valid under the rule of perpetuities. However, because Oliver can have more grandchildren more than 21 years after conveyance of the grant the rule of perpetutites invalidates the entire interest of both Victor and Vivan in the property. That said the rule of convenience does apply in this case as Victor and Vivan are the only two grandchildren that Oliver has at the time of conveyance, meaning that under the rule Vivan and Victor do have a valid interest since they are alive at the time of conveyance and will meet the necessary requirements within 21 years of conveyance. Any other grandchildren born do no have a valid interst in the property as the partial divestment closed at conveyance with both Victor and Vivan already being alive, since the rule of convenience notes that the parties must be alive at the time of creation of the grant to have a valid interest in a property, and as an exception to the rule of perpetuities it closes the open partial divestment when one party meets the necessary condition to make their interest vested and only the other parties that are alive and also have a future interest in that property can have a future claim to it. Thus, under the rule of convenience Robert has a life estate, Victor has vested remainder subject to partial closed divestment in fee simple, and Vivian has an executory interest in fee simple. "," 1a) FACTS: Alex purchases old warehouse on 10 acres of land in 2000 for $500,000. Alex previously worked at John Adams local brewery and plans to open up his own brewery on the 10 arces/warehouse which he opens on 2001. Alex invites Brock (brother) to join him in the business in 2003. Brock pays to it. Thus, under the rule of convenience Robert has a life estate, Victor has vested remainder subject to partial closed divestment in fee simple, and Vivian has an executory interest in fee simple. 2) 1a) FACTS: Alex purchases old warehouse on 10 acres of land in 2000 for $500,000. Alex previously worked at John Adams local brewery and plans to open up his own brewery on the 10 arces/warehouse which he opens on 2001. Alex invites Brock (brother) to join him in the business in 2003. Brock pays Alex for half of the buisness and the warehouse, but not the 10 acres. In exchange Alex signs a deed making him and his brother tenants in common. Alex is signifcantly invested in the business both emotionally and financially while Brock is growing tried of it. Bostonia (real estate developer) contacts the brother to purchase the warehouse and the 10 acres of land to develop condos for 2 million. Brock wants to sell and tries to convince Alex to agree but the brothers end up fighting and Alex ousters Brock when he states ""don't come back"" after refusing to sell. Possibilites available to Brock given his property interest? When Alex made the deed that granted Brock half of the buisness and the warehouse, Alex was not giving Brock a property interest in the 10 acres of land just in the brewery buisness itself and in the building. What that means is that property has no ownership of the 10 acres of land, meaning that he would not be able to selling the 10 acres to the developer as it is not his to do so. That said if Brock did have a property interest in 10 acres then it would probably be for 5 acres of the land and make him a tenant in common with Alex (based on the presumption that since Alex deed have his buisness and the warehouse to Brock that if were to give Brock an interest in the 10 acres then he would given him half of that as well). Under those circumstances Brock would be able to go to court and as for a parition of sale to be able to sell all 10 acres to the developer. However, Alec would argue against a parition of sale and ask the court for a parition in kind since he is emotionally and financially invested the property and in the business that he has on the land. Giving that the warehouse is on the 10 acres of land, depending on its location, it could be difficult for the Court to physically divide the land in a why that would give both Brock and Alex equal shares. Thus, a court could rule in favor of Brock for a parition of sale, which would mean that Alex would be forced of the land and forced to move his buisness. However, a court that is following the personality rule could rule in favor of Alex for a parition in kind given that he is personally invested in the property and try to physicall divide the land, which would mean that Alex would have to pay Brock for devaluing his the land as a remedey. However since that is not the case the most Brock can do is try to buyout Alex's interest in the warehouse and the buisness and then sell the warehouse to the developer. The 10 acres of land will however stay under the ownership of Alex. 1b) FACTS: As Brock is leaving he bumps into Carl (customer) and Carl drops his phone and leans which would mean that Alex would be forced of the land and forced to move his buisness. However, a court that is following the personality rule could rule in favor of Alex for a parition in kind given that he is personally invested in the property and try to physicall divide the land, which would mean that Alex would have to pay Brock for devaluing his the land as a remedey. However since that is not the case the most Brock can do is try to buyout Alex's interest in the warehouse and the buisness and then sell the warehouse to the developer. The 10 acres of land will however stay under the ownership of Alex. 1b) FACTS: As Brock is leaving he bumps into Carl (customer) and Carl drops his phone and leans down to pick it up when he notices a small hole at the base of the warehouse wall. He looks into the whole and pulls out a mesh bag that contains old gold coins in it. The mesh bag has the name of a local grocery store on it that had opened 10 years earlier. A few days later Carl finds out the coins are worth 20,000 dollars and are from the late-1800s. Before going home Carl picks up his growler to have the bartender fill it with beer for which the bartender gave him a claim ticket with a number on it that matched the number tag on the growler. when Carl goes to claim the his glass cup the bartender tells him that they can't find the item. Apparently one of the employees dropped the cup as the bartender has seen other employees cleaning up shattered glass on the floor. As Carl leaves he goes to grab his coat of one of the hooks on the front door and noes that it is not there after searching multiple time. Carl's ownership over the gold coins and his possible bailment claim over coat and growler. The gold coins that Carl found were in a mesh bag and from the late-1800s and but in a small hole at the base of the warehouse, meaning that an assumption can be made that the true owner of the goins was either mislaid the property or Carl discovered a treasture trove. However, given that the mesh bag has the name of a local grocery store that only opened up 10 years ago a strong presumption that the gold coins in the mesh bag is most likely what a court would find them to be as they were put there with the intention to carefully stored, as the local grocery store did not exist in the late-1800s as they just opened up 10 years ago.That said, if the gold coins were in fact a treasure trove then Carl could claim a legal right to them as he is the first one to have found them and an argument can be made that the original owner is either dead or not coming back for them after such a long time. However as that is not the case here, under finder's law, in particular mislaid property, the gold coins belong to the true owner of the mesh bag, which is the local grocery store; but since Carl found them on Alex's warehouse then Alex technically has a legal claim to the coins, in which he is the owner but should still make every effort to notify the true owner of their gold coins, like in the wallet found in the barbershop case. As such Carl has not legal right or claim to the gold coins even 4ifofhe8 was the one to find them. As for the coat and the growler, Carl can make a claim against the brewery under bailment. When Carl here, under finder's law, in particular mislaid property, the gold coins belong to the true owner of the mesh bag, which is the local grocery store; but since Carl found them on Alex's warehouse then Alex technically has a legal claim to the coins, in which he is the owner but should still make every effort to notify the true owner of their gold coins, like in the wallet found in the barbershop case. As such Carl has not legal right or claim to the gold coins even if he was the one to find them. As for the coat and the growler, Carl can make a claim against the brewery under bailment. When Carl gave the bartender his growler and the bartender gave him a claim ticket and then tagged the glass cup with the same number appearing on the claim ticket a temporary bailment was made under which Carl assumed that he would get he growler back in the same condition that he gave it to the bartender under. However, since an employee of the brewery appeared to have destory his property while under their care Carl can bring a claim against them under that assumption and find them liable, like in the majority in the Hyatt Hotel case, espeically since the claim ticket and tag on his item gives a presumption that the brewery being held accountable for the item untill such time that Carl goes to collect his growler from their possession and back into his. The same argument can be made for the Carl's coat. However, a court siding with the minority in Hyatt Hotel can find that a bailment did not existent between Carl and the brewery given that there is no claim ticket, like there was with the growler, and that no one is diligently watching over the coats on the hanger, and as a result there is no indication that a bailment was created under which the brewery is liable for Carl's coat being stolen. 1c) FACTS: Deal with developer falls through and by 2006 Brock and Alex are on speaking terms again. Brock decides to sell his interest to Alex who becomes the sole owner of the brewery and the land. In 2016 Alex divides the property. He sells 5 vacant acres to Daivd (real estate developer) with a deed as a determinable in fee simple with an executory interest to Frank and Fred as tenants in common. He sells another 5 acres, including warehouse, to Edward as a fee simple in subject to a condition (cant make IPA on the premeises) with Alex having a right of re-entry if the condition is violated. In 2017 Daivd plans to build a development with a mixture of resdiential units and ground floor commerical stores, while Edward decides to start making IPAs on the property. Alex wants to see what he can legal against David and Edward When Alex gave David 5 acres of the land ""so long as the property is used for residental uses only"" a fee simple subject to a condition was created that gave Frank and Fred, as tenants in common, an executory interest in fee simple of those 5 acres if David ever broke the condition. A year later after having sold the propery to Daivd, David decides to build a developemnt with a mixture of residental units and ground floor commerical stores, which does violate the condition set forth by Alex about the Alex wants to see what he can legal against David and Edward When Alex gave David 5 acres of the land ""so long as the property is used for residental uses only"" a fee simple subject to a condition was created that gave Frank and Fred, as tenants in common, an executory interest in fee simple of those 5 acres if David ever broke the condition. A year later after having sold the propery to Daivd, David decides to build a developemnt with a mixture of residental units and ground floor commerical stores, which does violate the condition set forth by Alex about the property being used for residential use only. A legal claim could be made by Frank and/or Fred, not by Alex since Alex no longer has any claim to the property, but his sons do. However, in such a case a David could look at the language used, in particular the words ""residental use only,"" and make a claim that the mixture of residental units and ground floor commerical stores is still within the parameters of the condition given that the commerical stores of the the residental, who would be living in the units, to use. As for the 5 acres that Alex gave to Edward, edward has a fee simple subject to condition that IPAs are never made on the premises and with Alex maintaining a right of re-entry if the condition is violated. In this case, as soon as Edward were to start making IPAs all Alex would have to do is enter the warehouse to reclaim his legal title. If Alex does not do that then he has no legal claim to those 5 acres. "," 2) FACTS: Andrew and Betty married and own property as tenants by entirety and never divorced even though they fought and lived separately for long periods of time. Andrew sold Greenacre to Chris in 2001 and forged Betty's signature on the deed. Andrew died in 2004.Chris was unaware of that fact and left his interest in the property to Debbie when he died in 2009. Debbie moved on to the property to live full time in 2011. In 2019 Betty is still alive and drives up one summer and finds Debbie in Greenarce. Greenacre claims by Debbie and Betty Since Andrew and Betty were married and never divorced the right of suriviorship was never severed, even though Andrew sold Greenarce to Chris since a tenancy by entirety cannot be severed unilaterally as in in U.S. v. Craft, meaning that Betty can make an argument that she still maintains her ownership of the house under the right of suriviorship, her husband died in 2004, since she never agreed to mutally part with it. However, Chris had truly believed that the property was his when he bought and got the deed for Greenarce from Andrew. Chris was acting in good-faith and did not suspect that Andrew has Chris' adverse possession of the property began foraged Betty' signature during their transaction. Thus, in 2001 under color of title since he truly did believe that the deed was good and not foraged. During this time Chris improved the property (open and notorious element) by enlarging and insulating the as in in U.S. v. Craft, meaning that Betty can make an argument that she still maintains her ownership of the house under the right of suriviorship, her husband died in 2004, since she never agreed to mutally part with it. However, Chris had truly believed that the property was his when he bought and got the deed for Greenarce from Andrew. Chris was acting in good-faith and did not suspect that Andrew has foraged Betty' signature during their transaction. Thus, Chris' adverse possession of the property began in 2001 under color of title since he truly did believe that the deed was good and not foraged. During this time Chris improved the property (open and notorious element) by enlarging and insulating the wooden cabin on the land, continously showed up during fishing season, had exclusive ownership of it given that he granted permission to his neighbors to hunt and restricted their access to the land, and was actually using the property since he explored the surrounding area by taking long walks and making improvements on the property, Andrew knew about it, and Betty could have visited the property whenever she wanted too but chose not too. Chris maintained his use of the property for 8 years until his death when voluntarily transferred his interest in the property in the to his daughter Debbie. At which point Debbie improved the property by building a year-round house on the land, and moved in on 2011. Debbie never goes ventures beyond the 2 arces around her house, which she cleared to turn into a formal garden, and grants the neighbors permission to use the land to hunt by restricts their access to it. Under these facts Debbie can tack on the years that her father used the property to her own issue of Greenacre because he is the one who gave it to her, meaning that she has a total of 17 years (assuming that the period of time between which Chris died and Debbie moved in is how long it took for Debbie's house to be constructed) of adverse possession. As such Debbie can make a argument that since she has been exclusively, open and notorious, continuously, and has a color of title on Greenarce that she has now has adverse possession over the entire 50 acres of the property since she restriced and granted access to the land, was open and notorious when she built her home and made her garden, has a color of title through her father's purchase of the deed that was voluntarily transferred to her, and was actually (hostile) living year-round on the property that under these facts she fufills all elements necessary to grant her adverse possession. If a court were to rule in Debbie's favor then Debbie could technically claim all 50 acres of Greenarce and not just the portion of the property (her house and the additional 2 arces of her garden) that would be given to her under regular adverse possession. That said, Betty can make an argument that not all element of adverse possession, both under regular adverse possession and color of title, were met since Debbie would have had to have been using at 21 years (the statutory period) and has only been using it for approximately 9 years, from the time she was contructing her home to moving in and living there until Betty found her on the porch. Of course Debbie could counter Betty's claim by tacking on Chris' If a court were to rule in Debbie's favor then Debbie could technically claim all 50 acres of Greenarce and not just the portion of the property (her house and the additional 2 arces of her garden) that would be given to her under regular adverse possession. That said, Betty can make an argument that not all element of adverse possession, both under regular adverse possession and color of title, were met since Debbie would have had to have been using at 21 years (the statutory period) and has only been using it for approximately 9 years, from the time she was contructing her home to moving in and living there until Betty found her on the porch. Of course Debbie could counter Betty's claim by tacking on Chris' use of the property, like in the 3200 strip of lot case, since possesion of Greenarce was voluntarily transferred to her. However, that would only total up to approximately 17 years, meaning that even by adding on her father's use of Greenarce Debbie would still be short be two years, as a result Betty would still maintain title/ownership over Greenarce as Debbie does not have adverse possession over the land.

"," As tenants in common what rights do Brock have and options available to him? Tenants in commons are people who share a undivided interest in a property that may vary in fraction of the property. One has the right to do as they please with their interest in the property. Brock and Alex have a valid interest as tenants as common. Therefore, Brock can convey just his interest of the property to the developer. Similar to the Martin case where the defendant as tenant in common has the right to exclude, the right to transfer their interest, and the right to enjoy their interest how they deem fit, here Brock may do the same and sell the developer his interest in the property. However, Alex can recite those same rights as to his undivided interest in the property therefore objecting to sell his interets. Brock may also, file for a partition of land by sale. In the Delfino case the plaintiff and defendant were in a dispute about property and had different opinions on what to the do with the land, although they ruled for a partition in kind, the court also recognizes times when a sale should be rendered based on the impossibility of physical attitributes, equity of land as a whole, and owner's interest. Brock may argue that a significant amount of money can be earned from this transaction and it would benifit both parties economically. After receiving such a large sum of cash Alex can buy another set of land. However, Alex may refuse this action and argue for a partition in kind. Alex can argue any zoning regulations or issues that will arise out of the land being subdivided. Alex may further this argument by saying he built his livelihood around this business and he made tremendous effort to start this business, therefore, it shouldn't be ripped from him by a partion by sale. Brock may counter this argument by saying if the court was to order a partition in kind, it could decrease the value owner's interest.

A Delfino court may order a partition in kind. Both parties have rights in the interest however, Alex has a valid claim to his interest as well and had dreams of always opening his own brewery. This will support both parties because Alex will keep his portion and Brock would be able to sell his potion. 3) <QUESTION id='Q1' tell=""Question 1b. ""> <![CDATA[ Does Carl have a absolute title to the gold coins? The laws of treasure trove, states, that if anyone finds gold coins that appears to be abadoned and the owners are presumbly dead or non-living then that person shall have complete title. Carl may have complete title to the gold coins. If it is determined that based of the apperance of the coins they aged or seem really old it is presumed the owners of the coins are dead, for if they were alive they would have returned for the property. This will give Carl complete ownership of the property.He may argue that the bag the coins were found in are from a grocery store that opened 10 years ago and if the owners wanted it, they would of retrieved it by now. However, in the Medina case the court held that property that is misplace should be given to the owner of the establishment, in hopes that the true owner will come back to reclaim the item, therefore the finder woudn't have superior title to it. If the court evaluates the coins and they don't appear to suffer from age and given the fact that Carl found them in a mesh bag, that may infer the coins were placed there with the intention of retrieving them the court can classify this as Mislaid property. If mislaid, similar to the plaintiff in Medina having no rights to the money in the wallet found on the owners property, here Carl would have the legal duty to give the gold coins to Brock or Alex. If Brock or Alex found out they would have superior title to the coins. However, if the coins are deemed abadoned by thier 8 apperance and the method used to preserve them, the court will classify them as treasure trove and Carl would have complete title to it. He may also argue and say the property was lost because it was in a small hole in the warehouse and the previous owner mesh bag, that may infer the coins were placed there with the intention of retrieving them the court can classify this as Mislaid property. If mislaid, similar to the plaintiff in Medina having no rights to the money in the wallet found on the owners property, here Carl would have the legal duty to give the gold coins to Brock or Alex. If Brock or Alex found out they would have superior title to the coins. However, if the coins are deemed abadoned by thier apperance and the method used to preserve them, the court will classify them as treasure trove and Carl would have complete title to it. He may also argue and say the property was lost because it was in a small hole in the warehouse and the previous owner could've dropped it. Like in Armory the chimeny sweep had a complete title to the jews except ture owner, here Carl would have superior title to all subsequent claimans except the true owner. However, Brock and Alex can say that it was gently placed in the hole, depending on how small the hole is they can reasoned that it took human precesion to disclose and try to hide such an item. The court may likely rule for Brock and Alex if it is determined that the property was in fact mislaid. However, if otherwise treasure trove or lost the court will give complete title to Carl. Does Carl still have a right of title to his Coat? If a item is misplaced and if found the founder has complete title to that item except from true owner? Carl intentionally placed his coat on the hooks therefore letting us know that his property was misplaced because he had put in a specific place with intentions of coming back for it. Similar in the medina case if found, whomever found the jacket had a legal duty to give the jacket to the establishment of which the item was found and the true owner has complete title. If Carl found his jacket he would be able to get his jack back if classifiy as mislaid property. However, the fact that he say ""forget it"" may signal that he relinquished all rights to the jacket and no longer wants the jacket. If determined so then he won't have a valid claim to the item for it will be classified as abandoned property. The court may reasoned the item has abadoned and therefore losing complete title to his property. Does Carl still have a title to his growler? If a item is lost, the finder has complete title against the world except the true owner. Yes for the same reasons in the Armory case, if property is lost then the true owner has complete title to the property, if found. Here in this instance its presumed that the growler has broken. However, if it is not the case that it is then he can reclaim the growler if found. Unlike the jacket he has sentimental value towards the growler and can argue that he would never abadon such an item, for it was given to him by a dear friend. If a item is lost, the finder has complete title against the world except the true owner. Yes for the same reasons in the Armory case, if property is lost then the true owner has complete title to the property, if found. Here in this instance its presumed that the growler has broken. However, if it is not the case that it is then he can reclaim the growler if found. Unlike the jacket he has sentimental value towards the growler and can argue that he would never abadon such an item, for it was given to him by a dear friend. Court will grant him his growler if found. Can Carl bring a bailment action for the growler and coat? A bailment is created when a bailor gives a bailee their property with one particular purpose and without ownershhip. It must be a clear delivery of item, acceptance over the item, dominion can be exerted over the item. Similar to the Green case when there was a clear acceptance, control, and delivery of property, here Carl cleary did all these requirements with his growler and coat. Carl may argue and seek damages for his growler if in fact it broke by the hands of the workers. Carl may argue a bailment was created and there was an expected duty of care with his property and he received a ticket for the growler, which led him to expect that it would be handled with care. The bartender may argue and say that there wasn't a bailment created because it wasn't expressly agreed upon. Like the defendant in Green Carl may say that the bailment was implied because he received a ticket that would help him identify his growler, and that the bartender has complete control and execised dominion over it. However for the coat the court may reason and say no. The element of clear acceptance would fail because it was Carl own unilateral decision to place his coat there. No worker established possession nor did they give a clear acceptance or exerted dominion over the property. Carl may argue construtive possession and say the fact that it was on the hook of the business led him to believe that he haf a reasonble expectation that his coat would be on the hook when he returned. The court may rule that there was a bailment for the growler and award Carl damages but for the coat they may say that it wasn't a clear delivery but his own unilateral decision to put the coat there. 4) 1c. Doed David have a executory interest subject to limitations? A executory interest is followed by a fee simple. they may say that it wasn't a clear delivery but his own unilateral decision to put the coat there. 4) 1c. Doed David have a executory interest subject to limitations? A executory interest is followed by a fee simple. David has a executory interest which is important because it follows a executory interest, therefore if a condition is violated then frank and fred interest would immededialty vest. Similar to the Marenholz case where the county held a fee simple determinable because the grant had durational language state ""to be used only for school purposes,"" it was subject to a possibility of reverter. Here the Alex conveyed interest to david stating ""to david, so long as the property is used for residential use only, if it is ever used then to my two sons."" This created a executory interest for Alex sons and a executory interest subject to limitations in david. In this instace, Alex may eject david because his son's interest would vest. The court in this instance would grant the land to Alex sons. Does Edward have a executory interest? A executory interest is followed by a fee simple. Edward has a executory interest which is important because it follows a executory interest. Here Edward had the condition not sell anything other than IPA'S. Once he did this he violated his interest. Alex now has to exercise a right of entry but if not then they can continue to possess the land unitl he ejects them. The court will rule in favor of Alex if he chooses to eject. Can Alex eject? Yes. Right to exclude once condition violated. Can Alex eject? Yes. Right to exclude once condition violated.

Their interest is contingent because it is dependent on them satisfying the requirement of being the first to retire. Nephew Robert has a vested remainder in a life esate. His interest is vested because he does not need to do anything to take it, and it is not subject to an open class. Oliver's grandchildren have a contingent remainder in fee simple absolute. Their interest is contingent because they must reach the age of 25. Oliver's estate has a reversion in fee simple absolute, because the grandchildrens interest is contingent. Applying the RAP: The RAP applies to vested remainders subject to open, contingent remainders, and executory interests. Oliver's first child to retire has a contingent remainder in a life estate, so it is subject to the RAP. Under the RAP, this interest is void. Oliver could have another child, Sam, and then die the next day. Oliver's other living children, Connor and Carla, may also die before retiring. Sam, the afterborn child, may retire in 70 years, well outside the perpetuities time period. Robert's vested remainder in a life esate is not subject to the RAP, so it is valid. Oliver's grandchildren's contingent remainder in fee simple absolute is subject to the RAP. The rule of convenience applies to this interest, because at the time of conveyance, Victor is 26 and has already met the requirement (of reachinf the age of 25). As such, under the rule of convenience, the only other person who can enter the class and take the property is Vivian, who was alive at the time of conveyance, after/if she reaches the age of 25. This interest is valid under the RAP. Oliver's reversion is not subject to the RAP. Rewritten: To Nephew Robert for life, then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25. Now, Robert has a life in fee simple. Oliver's estate has a reversion in estate, and the grandchildren have a contingent remainder fee simple absolute. RAP.

Tenancy in common means that co-tenants have a fractional and undivided interest in the whole property. Both have the right to posses and use the whole. In this case, the issues is over what these rights allow Brock to do, and how he can best uses these rights to ""make some money"". Under tenancy in common, there are a few alternatives for what Brock can do in order to make money. First, he could bring an action for an accounting for his share of the profits from his brother, Alex. As co-tenants, both brothers have a right to share in the profits of the business. Furthermore, he may also bring an action against Alex for a contribution for rent, as Brock could argue that he was ousted from the property when Alex told him to ""get out of here and don't come back"". As tenants in common, Brock has the right to transfer/convey his interest to whomever he choses. He could do simply sell his 1/2 interest to the property developer. However, in order to make a greater amount of money from the developer, it would be in his best interests to file a partition action. Partitions can be either in kind, meaning a physical division of the property equal to eat parties interests, or by sale, which would require selling the property at fair market value, and then splitting the proceeds between each co tenant proportional to their fractional interest in the property. Generally, courts prefer a partition in kind, and reserve parition by sale for situations where a parition in kind is impractiable or impossible. The court will consider whether it is possible to value the property adequately, as than others. The court will also consider sometimes certain portions of property are more valuable emotional connections to the property. sale, which would require selling the property at fair market value, and then splitting the proceeds between each co tenant proportional to their fractional interest in the property. Generally, courts prefer a partition in kind, and reserve parition by sale for situations where a parition in kind is impractiable or impossible. The court will consider whether it is possible to value the property adequately, as sometimes certain portions of property are more valuable than others. The court will also consider emotional connections to the property. In order to make the most from the developers, Brock should try to get a partition by sale, since Alex is unwilling to sell to the real estate developers. IAlex, becuase of his attachment to the property and the business will probably argue for a partition in kind, so that he can remain on the property and perform his business at the brewery. The court will consider all the interests of all parties, both financial and personal, in determining which type of partition action is appropriate. The court is likely to hold that, like in Delfino v. Vealencis, because of the Alex's connection to the property, and because of his livelihood being derived from the business on the property, parition in kind may be preferable. Furthermore, there is nothing in the facts that suggests that it would be impossible to parition the land physically in a way that would provide equal value to both co-tenants. 3) <QUESTION id='Q1' tell=""Question 1B. ""> <![CDATA[ Gold Coins: The main issue regarging the coins is what kind of property they are: treasure trove, abandoned, mislaid or lost? Determining which kind of property the coins are will determine whether or not Carl has a claim to them as a finder. Abandoned items are discarded by the prior owner, who intends to relinquish ownership of the property. Abandoned items belong to the finder, good against the world, even the true prior owner. Lost property is property that the owner unintentionally misplaces, by dropping it, etc, but did not intend to relinquish ownership. Lost property goes to the finder if the true owner cannot be located (Armory v. Delamirie). Mislaid property is property that is intentionally placed somewhere by the owner, but they then forget about it and leave it behind (McAvoy v. Medina). Mislaid property belongs to the owner of the land that the mislaid property was found on, because the true owner is more likely to come back for it. Treasure Trove property generally has an element of antiquity to it, and is generally used for property. Abandoned items belong to the finder, good against the world, even the true prior owner. Lost property is property that the owner unintentionally misplaces, by dropping it, etc, but did not intend to relinquish ownership. Lost property goes to the finder if the true owner cannot be located (Armory v. Delamirie). Mislaid property is property that is intentionally placed somewhere by the owner, but they then forget about it and leave it behind (McAvoy v. Medina). Mislaid property belongs to the owner of the land that the mislaid property was found on, because the true owner is more likely to come back for it. Treasure Trove property generally has an element of antiquity to it, and is generally used for coins and money. The treasure trove property must be of such a nature that because of its age the true owner is likely dead or cannot be otherwise located. Treasure Trover property goes to the finder. Some courts also recognize embedded property, when property has become part of the natural earth. Carl will likely want to argue that the coins are either treasure trover or lost, because Carl would then have a greater chance at being able to keep the coind under the rules of finders. However, the brewery will probably argue that the coins are mislaid, so that they would have rights to them as the owner of the land on which they were found. Carl could argue that the coins are treasure trove property, because they appeared to be very old, and are in fact from the late 1800s. However, a counterarguement is that they are not treasure trove because the bag they are stored in is from only about 10 years ago, so the owner may not be dead or undiscoverable. Since finders law revolves around the relativity of title, the most recent possessor who stored them in the bag is the most recent owner, even though the coins appear old. Carl will most likely not be successful in claiming that the are treasure trove because of the possibility that the most recent possessor is probably still alive. Carl could argue that the coins were lost, although this is unlikely because of the way that they were found inside the hole in the wall. It is unlikely that the coins unintentionally fell into that particular spot, so this arguement will most likley not win. The issue with the storage of these coins is most akin to the money hidden in the airplane wall, in Benjamin v. Linder Aviation. The money in the airplane was ruled to be mislaid, and as such went to the owner of the property the money was found in, which was the bank that had repossessed the aircraft. Similarly, the owners of the brewery could likley make a strong case that the coins were clearly mislaid, like the money in the airplane, and that someone hid them in the wall for safe keeping but was not able to return for them. of the coins, because if they are ruled to be It is likely that Carl will not be able to claim ownership mislaid, then they would belong to the owner of the wall, which would be the owners of the brewery. The c the owner of the property the money was found in, which was the bank that had repossessed the aircraft. Similarly, the owners of the brewery could likley make a strong case that the coins were clearly mislaid, like the money in the airplane, and that someone hid them in the wall for safe keeping but was not able to return for them. It is likely that Carl will not be able to claim ownership of the coins, because if they are ruled to be mislaid, then they would belong to the owner of the wall, which would be the owners of the brewery. The c Growler: The main issue surrounding the Growler is whether or not there was a bailment created between Carl and the Brewery. Bailment between a bailor (the person transferring temporary possession) and bailee (the person taking temporary possession) establishes a reasonable duty of care that the bailee must take that is specific to the circumstances. In order to establish a bailment, there must be a voluntary transfer of possession, but not title, temporarily from the bailor to the bailee, so that the item was in the possession and control of the bailee and excluded from third parties. Similar to the case of Allen v. Hyatt, in order to recover from the Brewery, Carl will want to make an arguement that establishes that there was in fact a bailment, and that breaking the Growler was a violation of the duty of care created under the bailment. Carl will argue that there was a bailment because he transferred possession of the growler to the employee, who in turn gave him a return ticket to collect the growler. Like in Allen, where the owner of a car parked his car in a garage and received a ticket, this ticket does suffice to establish transferring of possession. Carl will arguably have a stronger case in this respect because he got his ticket from an actual employee, rather than a computer. Carl will also need to establish that in transferring possession to this employee, the possession of the Growler was exclusive to the Brewery. This can be presumed by the fact that the growler was taken away from Carl to where he could not access it behind the bar with the bartender. Furthermore, Carl will need to establish that the brewery violated their duty of care when they broke the growler. Because of the nature of the exchange, the duty of care is very limited - that is, the duty is only to return the growler in the same condition (unbroken) with the beer in it. By breaking the growler, the Brewery very clearly breached this reasonable duty of care. Carl will likley prevail against the brewery with regards to the Growler based on this bailment theory. by the fact that the growler was taken away from Carl to where he could not access it behind the bar with the bartender. Furthermore, Carl will need to establish that the brewery violated their duty of care when they broke the growler.

By breaking the growler, the Brewery very clearly breached this reasonable duty of care. Carl will likley prevail against the brewery with regards to the Growler based on this bailment theory. Coat: Similar to the Growler, the main issue regarding Carl's coat is whether or not the Brewery is liable to him through Bailment theory. Most likely, the Brewery will not be responsible for the loss of Carl's coat. As above, a bailment is created when temporary possession is granted to the bailee by the bailor, in a way that excludes the property from the owner and from third parties. By placing his coat on the hook by the door, Carl never transferred possession to anyone. He did not even receive an automated ticket or something that might otherwise suggest a bailment. Since there was no transfer of possession, there was no duty of reasonable care owed by the brewery to Carl in regards to his coat. Carl will likely not be able to recover the value of his coat from the brewery becuase there was no bailment created. 4) <QUESTION id='Q1' tell=""Question 1C. ""> <![CDATA[ Devise by Deed to David: This deed gave David a fee simple subject to executory limitation, shown by the language that if the condition is violated, ie if it is used for non residential purposes, then it can be taken after it becomes possessory. Frank and Fred have a shifting executory interest in fee simple, because they can divest david's property interest if the condition is ever broken. However, Frank and Fred's executory interest is subject to the RAP. Under the RAP, this interest is void. The property could be switched from a residence to a non-residence in 100 years, well after the perpetuities period ends. The deed must be rewritten to give David a fee simple absolute in the property. Because of this limitation by the RAP, Alex most likely does not have a legal claim against David. Since possessory. Frank and Fred have a shifting executory interest in fee simple, because they can divest david's property interest if the condition is ever broken. However, Frank and Fred's executory interest is subject to the RAP. Under the RAP, this interest is void. The property could be switched from a residence to a non-residence in 100 years, well after the perpetuities period ends. The deed must be rewritten to give David a fee simple absolute in the property. Because of this limitation by the RAP, Alex most likely does not have a legal claim against David. Since David has the property in fee simple absolute, Alex cannot enforce the restriction on the use of property. This is consistent with the court's general interest in limiting dead hand control and other restraints on the use of property. Devise by Deed to Edward: This deed appears, because of the ""so long as"" language of duration, to give Edward the property in fee simple determinable, which is alsoways followed by a possibility of reverter. However, the language that gives Alex the right to re-enter and take the property is consistent with the right of entry/power of termination, which follows a fee simple subjuct to condition subsequent. Consitstent with Mahrenholz v. School Board, in cases of such ambiguity, the court will favor the fee simple subject to condition subsequnt. This is favored because when followed by a right of entry, the grantor or his estate is required to take some sort of affirmative step to retake the property, where as with a possibility of reverter they do not have to take such a step. As such, under a right of entry, the grantee is less likely to lose the property, because the grantor or his esate is less likely to actually take the required steps to retake the property. The court has a policy interest in protecting the interests of the grantees in such cases. As such, a court would likely hold that Edward has the property in a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and Alex has the right of re-entry/power of termination in fee simple. Neither of these interests is subject to the RAP. Alex will be able to make a claim against Edward to re-take the property if he can prove that Edward is making IPA's on the property, hence breaking the condition subsequent, and that he can prove that he took an affirmative step to enter and retake the property. If he can prove this, he is likely to be successful in taking the property back. 5) "," As tenants by the entirety, Betty and Andrew had the right to possession and use of the property jointly. Tenancy by the entirety essentially makes the property held by another entity - the married couple as one. The interest is not divided or able to be unilaterally alienated by either spouse. Tenancy by the entirety includes the right of survivorship. Betty could claim a right to greenacre based on the right of survivorship afforded to her by the tenancy by the entirety. Most likely, her strongest argument is that when her husband fraudulently conveyed the property to Chris by forging her signature, he was attempting to unilaterally alienate, which is not allowed by the tenancy by the entirety. She may claim that this means the tenancy by the entirety is still in tact, and that she got the entire interest in the property when Andrew died under the right of survivorship. She will also argue that the court has an interest in protecting the innocent spouse from the wrongdoings of the other, and protecting the family home and the interests of the family unit. However, the arguement may not be strong as she has never been to the property and has no familial ties to it or children who currently reside there with her and rely on it. Debbie, on the other hand, could on the doctrine of adverse possession and color of title to prove her ownership of the property. Because Chris, her father, was acting under Color of Title based on the forged deed, if all elements of adverse possession can be proved and the Statute of limitations has run, then Chris's title would extend to all of the property he believed that he had, and not just the part he was actually possessing/using. This title, based on color of title, to the entire property, would then be transferable to Debbie through his will. While the deed was clearly defective, because of the forged signature, Betty will try to stop Debbie by arguing that she has not satisfied at least one of the elements of adverse possession. Actual: Actual use means that the possessor is physically on the property. Clearly, Debbie will be successful in arguing that she is physically on the proeprty because she lives on Greenacre year round. in a way that typical owner would. The title Open and Notorious: The possessor is using the property owner must be put on actual or constructive notice. In this case, Debbie's use was open and notorious to the extent that it would put Betty on constructive notice. If Betty had been using the property as a of adverse possession. Actual: Actual use means that the possessor is physically on the property. Clearly, Debbie will be successful in arguing that she is physically on the proeprty because she lives on Greenacre year round. Open and Notorious: The possessor is using the property in a way that typical owner would. The title owner must be put on actual or constructive notice. In this case, Debbie's use was open and notorious to the extent that it would put Betty on constructive notice. If Betty had been using the property as a normal owner did, she would have known that it was being adversly possessed. Since Betty did not visit it, she did not know of this adverse possessor. Debbie will likely be successful in proving that her use was open and notorious because of this constructive notice, and furthermore for the fact that she was acting without trying to conceal or hide her use. Furthermore, Debbie used the property as a normal owner would by building the garden and maintaining the house, etc. Continuous: The use was uninterupted for the entire statutory period (10 years), in a manner that is typical of how a normal owner would use it. Debbie will argue that between her fathers use and her own, the use of the property was continuous. Betty will argue that her fathers use was not continuous because he was only there for about 8 weeks out of the year. Exclusive: The possessor excludes third parties and the title owner. Debbie will argue that her use is exclusive because she excludes people from the 2 acres around her house, and grants permission to others to hunt and fish on her land. Betty will argue that this use was not exclusive because they do not need to expressly get permission to hunt or fish, they are merely ""allowed"". Betty will say this distinction between being allowed and having express permission means that her use of the entire property was not exclusive. However, under Color of title, if Debbie can prove that this exclusive element is satisfied for the part she actually possesses (the two acres her home is on), then she has satisfied it for the entire area. Hostile: The possessor possesses the property without asking for permission or acknowledging a better title. Debbie will argue that she was acting without anyone's permission, because we can presume she genuinely believed that the land was hers based on the deed that her father acquired and did not question. Furthermore, is the issue of the statutory time limit. Debbie will argue that it was satisfied in 2011 (8 years ago), because the clock started when Chris began using it in 2001 after aquiring it from Andrew. Because the transfer of title from Chris to Debbie was voluntary, and the two were in privity, Chris's time could be tacked on to satisfy the time requirement. However, Betty will argue that Chris only used genuinely believed that the land was hers based on the deed that her father acquired and did not question. Furthermore, is the issue of the statutory time limit. Debbie will argue that it was satisfied in 2011 (8 years ago), because the clock started when Chris began using it in 2001 after aquiring it from Andrew. Because the transfer of title from Chris to Debbie was voluntary, and the two were in privity, Chris's time could be tacked on to satisfy the time requirement. However, Betty will argue that Chris only used it sporadicly, so he was not actually possessing it at that time, and that the clock should have started when debbie moved in in 2011, therefore meaning that the statutory time period has not yet ended. Debbie's counterargument to this would be that Chris bought the area as a vacation property, so his use at the time did count for adverse possession because he was using it for vacations as a typical owner of that type of property would do. The court will likely rule in favor of Debbie, because the court has an interest in rewarding prodcutive use of land, as well as protecting the personal attachment to the land that develops over time as someone possesses it.

b8efdf86-6377-4fc4-b0b3-64d1bf7df43a," In this situation, Oliver's children, Connor and Carla, would have a contingent remainders in a life estates. This is contingent because in order to recieve the property they have to retire and be the first child of Oliver's to do so. It is a life estate because the language says ""for life"", indicating a life estate and not a fee simple. Next, Robert, Oliver's nephew, would have a remainder in a life estate. This is not contingent because Robert does not have to do anything in order to get the life estate, he just has to wait until the previous life estate ends. Following Robert's interest, we have to look at Oliver's grandchildren. Victor, who is already 26 years old, would have a vested remainder in fee simple subject to open, and Vivian would have a contingent remainder in fee simple. Victor's interest is vested because he has already satisfied the condition that the grandchild has to be 25 years old. Vivian has a contingent remainder because in order to have her interest vest, she will have to reach the age of 25. We also have to look at the Rule Against Perpetuities for some of the interests in this situation. First, we have to see which interests are subject to the rule. The rule applies to contingent remainders, vested remainders subject to open, and executory interests. Here, we have contingent remainders for Connor, Carla, and Vivian, and a vested remainder subject to open for Victor. Next, we have to see when the perpetuity window is open. Since this is a grant, the window is open at the time of conveyance. If this were to have been a deed, the perpetuity window would have opened when Oliver passed away. Next, we have to imagine situations that would make the interests vest or fail within a life in being plus 21 years. For Connor and Carla, they would have to be the first child to retire during their life. When they die, we will know if they retired or not from their job. This makes Connor and Carla their own validating lives, and would be valid under the Rule, since we would know if they retired or were the first to retire upon their death. As for Vivian, her interest would also be valid under the rule against perpetuities. When Vivian dies, we will know if she reached the age of 25 or not. Next we look at the vested remainder subject to open for Victor. For the class to close and Victor to be the only person in the class, Oliver would have to die, as well as Connor and Carla because then there is no way Oliver can have more children and therefore grandchildren. Another way for the class to close would be under the die, we will know if they retired or not from their job. This makes Connor and Carla their own validating lives, and would be valid under the Rule, since we would know if they retired or were the first to retire upon their death. As for Vivian, her interest would also be valid under the rule against perpetuities. When Vivian dies, we will know if she reached the age of 25 or not. Next we look at the vested remainder subject to open for Victor. For the class to close and Victor to be the only person in the class, Oliver would have to die, as well as Connor and Carla because then there is no way Oliver can have more children and therefore grandchildren. Another way for the class to close would be under the rule of convienience, which is when the previous interest holder dies when the class is still open. For this to happen, one of Oliver's children would have to retire and obtain the property, and die, then Robert would take the property, and die, and then the class on Victor would close without Vivian reaching the age of 25 and entering the class. Victors interest is valid under the rule against perpetuities because within his own life plus 21 years we will know if he has the property or not. "," A. Hi Brock, Thank you for coming into my office. From reading the deed created by your brother, Alex, it states that you two are tennants in common regarding the land that the brewery is on. Tennants in common means that you and your brother have undivided shares of the whole brewery. This is different than joint tennants with right of survivorship, because right of survivorship means that when one of you dies, the other would take over the entirety of the other's shares. In order to get out of a tennancy in common agreement, you can sell your shares to another person, or sell them to your brother. If Alex would like to remain on the land and not sell to the developer, you can ask him to buy your shares of the company. Although you would not be getting money from the developer, you would still be recieving money. B. Hi Carl, Thank you for coming into my office. The issue you have regarding the coins is whether or not you Although you would not be getting money from the developer, you would still be recieving money. B. Hi Carl, Thank you for coming into my office. The issue you have regarding the coins is whether or not you have the claim to the coins you found. I think you have a strong claim to keep the coins. You found them in the floor of the brewery while you were knocked over. The law of finders and property states that a finder has claim to the item they found against everyone except the true owner of the item. You are the finder of the coins, so it seems like you can make a good argument that the coins are yours, unless the true owner of the coins can come and claim them. In the Armory case, where a chimney sweepers boy found a jewel in the chimney, he was considered to be the finder of the jewel against everyone, except if the true owner of the jewel came to collect it. When the boy gave the jewel to the apprentice to have it examined, the apprentice did not have claim to the jewel like the boy did, because the boy was the one who found it. It can be argued that these coins are not mislaid, because mislaid property would not be in the ground. An example of something that is mislaid can be found in the McAvoy case, where a pocketbook was left on a table in a store. The person who noticed and found the pocketbook sitting on the table did not become the finder and therefore owner of the pocketbook, because that item was not lost property it was mislaid by the owner. In that situation, the store could hold the bag until the owner came to collect it, but could not claim the right to the bag themselves. If the coins were intentionally abandoned by their true owner, you would have the claim to the coins because a finder gets the claim to the item against everyone including the original owner if the item was abandoned. An issue that can arise is if the items were considered a treasure trove because they are from the 1800's. Although the coins are old and can be considered an antique, they were found in a grocery store bag from a place that opened only 10 years ago. Therefore, even if the coins themselves can be considered antique, they were not burried in the ground since the 1800's where their true owner would be undiscoverable or dead. They had to be surfaced and placed in that grocery bag for them to then end up under the ground. In the Corliss case we saw a situation where gold coins were found under thr ground on someone's property, and when the yard workers dug up the ground they found the coins and tried to claim them. This situation was noted as embedded property and gave the coins to the landowner, saying that the landowner owned everything underneath her property. Those coins were not mislaid as they would not be mislaid in the ground, and it could not have been a treasure trove case, because at that time there was no treasure trove doctrine. However, the brewery could argue that they undiscoverable or dead. They had to be surfaced and placed in that grocery bag for them to then end up under the ground. In the Corliss case we saw a situation where gold coins were found under thr ground on someone's property, and when the yard workers dug up the ground they found the coins and tried to claim them. This situation was noted as embedded property and gave the coins to the landowner, saying that the landowner owned everything underneath her property. Those coins were not mislaid as they would not be mislaid in the ground, and it could not have been a treasure trove case, because at that time there was no treasure trove doctrine. However, the brewery could argue that they have a claim to the coins aswell. They can say that similar to the situation in the Corliss case, they own the property underneath the brewery, and therefore the coins that were under it. However, I think you have a strong claim to those coins against the brewery under the law of finders, unless the brewery were the true owners of the coins. In regards to your coat and growler, there are a few issues. The first issue is whether a bailment was made between you and the brewery when you gave them the growler and they gave you the claim ticket. When a bailment is made, one person, the bailor, is giving temporary possession of the item to the bailee. The bailee has to intend to give the item back to the bailor, and there is usually a benefit such as payment. In this case, you gave your beloved growler to the bartender, and in doing so you created an implied bailment. You recieved a ticket which would alloe you to reclaim your item and take back possession from the bartender. While the bartender had your growler, they were in complete possession of it and assume liability. In the Allen v. Hyatt Regency case, an implied bailment was created when a man parked his car in the hotel parking garage. He was given a ticket which would later be used to reclaim his car from the garage. When the car was stolen from the lot, the plaintiff argued that it was the hotel's job to keep safe possession of his car, as per the bailment that was created. In the same way the plaintiff in that case was given a ticket to reclaim his car from the bailee, the hotel, you were given a ticket to reclaim your growler from the bartender, who was the bailee in this situation. The bartender and the brewery can argue and say that a bailment was not created when you gave them the growler to fill up, maybe because it was only in their possession for a short period of time. However, you passed on your possession to them intending on claiming it back, which gives you a strong argument in favor of creating a bailment and therefore making the brewery and bartender liable. As for the coat, I do not think your argument is strong enough to say that there was a bailment created for the coat. The coat you had on at the brewery was placed by you on a hook beside the brewery door. You did not give it to a worker with the intent to have it returned to you by the worker, you simply placed it on the hook. Due to this, I think your claim for the growler is much stronger, and unfortunatley the coat you lost was most likely stolen by someone else. If the coat was found by someone else, you could reclaim it because you are the true owner of the coat, and that relates back to the rule of finders as stated before. If found by creating a bailment and therefore making the brewery and bartender liable.

Lets talk about your situation regarding David first. The issue here is what the interests are regarding the 5 acres of land now that David is implementing the use of commercial stores on the land. In the deed, you conveyed the land to David so long as the property is used for residential uses only, and if it is ever used for non-residential uses, it would go to your two sons. This gave David a fee simple subject to executory limitation, and it gave your two sons, Frank and Fred, an executory interest in fee simple. In 2017 when David began using the land for commercial purposes as well, he violated the terms set by you in the deed, and your two sons would get the land due to their executory interest. This conveyance to Frank and Fred is subject to the rule against perpetuities. The rule against perpetuities states that within a life in being plus 21 years, the interest has to vest or fail. At the time of David's death and even 21 years past we will still be unsure if the land will ever be used for commercial purposes. For example, in 50 years after David's death, his heirs can change the land to be commercially used. Therefore, this conveyance is void under the rule against perpetuities. In order to make the conveyance valid under this rule, you could change the language of the deed to state something such as ""if it is ever used by David for non-residential uses, then to my two sons Frank and Fred"". Regarding Edward, the issue here is whether the conveyance gave Edward a fee simple determinable, or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. The language you used in your conveyance was ambiguous. In the Mahrenholz case regarding the school board, the courts were faced with similar ambiguity in the deed language. The court in that case had to look at the intent of the language and the deed to state something such as ""if it is ever used by David for non-residential uses, then to my two sons Frank and Fred"". Regarding Edward, the issue here is whether the conveyance gave Edward a fee simple determinable, or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. The language you used in your conveyance was ambiguous. In the Mahrenholz case regarding the school board, the courts were faced with similar ambiguity in the deed language. The court in that case had to look at the intent of the language and determine whether the conveyance was determinable or subject to condition subsequent. When you used the words ""so long as"" in the deed, that indicated a fee simple determinable. However you also stated that you, the grantor, would have the right to re-enter and reclaim the premises if IPA's were made, which indicates language of a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. In the school board case, the courts looked at the intent of the grantor. If we do the same here, it seems that your intent would be to reclaim the land if Edward begins making IPA's on the premises. Therefore, the courts will likely find that in making the deed, you gave Edward a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, with the condition being that he can never make IPA's on the land. Even if you and Edward die, having Edward never making IPA's, even if his heirs obtain the land through the fee simple and begin making IPA's, your estate and your heirs would be able to re-enter and reclaim the land. Since Edward did, however, end up making IPA's on the land, the court will most likely interpret the deed as being a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and you would be able to re-enter and reclaim the land. 3) "," The issue here is who has possession of Greenacre, Debbie or Betty. Debbie has a claim to Greenacre under adverse possession and color of title. In 2001 when Andrew sold Greenacre to Chris, he forged Betty's name. This gave Chris the title to Greenacre with a defect. Chris technically did not have the title to Greenacre and was beginning an adverse possession period. Under adverse possession you have to use the land openly and notoriously, continuously use the land, exclusively use the land, and use the land in a hostile way. Chris's estate can argue that he was openly using it on his trips to the cabin, and spent the fishing season on the land using under adverse possession and color of title. In 2001 when Andrew sold Greenacre to Chris, he forged Betty's name. This gave Chris the title to Greenacre with a defect. Chris technically did not have the title to Greenacre and was beginning an adverse possession period. Under adverse possession you have to use the land openly and notoriously, continuously use the land, exclusively use the land, and use the land in a hostile way. Chris's estate can argue that he was openly using it on his trips to the cabin, and spent the fishing season on the land using it openly. He would argue that it was continuous use of the land, because even when he was not there his neighbors were using it with permission. The land usage can be argued as exclusive, because he believed he had exclusive right to it with the title, and also the neighbors use of the land does not take away the exclusivity portion because they were there with permission to enter and use the land. The use of the land by Chris was hostile because he did not have actual title to it because it was defective, and Betty, who is a co-tenant, did not know of Chris's usage. In the Marengo Cave case, it was made clear what open and notorious meant in adverse possession. Since the cave was underground it was not considererd to be open usage. Here, the usage is open, even if for periods of time Chris is not on the land, because there was permission given to neighbors to use the land and they were acting in accordance to that permission by Chris. Color of title is when an adverse possessor gets the land in entirety when believed to have been on the land under a good claim, when in reality that claim was defective. When Andrew forged Betty's signature, the title became defective. If Chris were to satisfy the statute of limitations on adverse possession, he would have Greenacre in entirety. When Chris died in 2009 and left Greenacre to Debbie, she began adversely possessing the land. He could not have actually passed Greenacre down to her if he was an adverse possessor, but since he believed that his title to Greenacre was valid, he put Greenacre in the will to Debbie. Debbie will argue that until 2019 when Betty saw Debbie on the land, Debbie was tacking on the previous 8 years Chris was adversley possessing Greenacre to the time Debbie herself was adversley possessing Greenacre. In the Tieu case, tacking was explained as voluntarily adding the years a previous adverse possessor used the land to the years another adverse possessor used the land. That is what happened with Chris and Debbie. Debbie was an adverse possessor because she too used the land in an exclusive, open, hostile and continuous way. Like how Chris used it exclusively, she too let the neighbors with permission use the land. She also built a permanent house on Greenacre, showing a continuous usage. Debbie openly used it, by building the house, and was hostile because Betty did not know of the usage and Debbie believed it was hers. Through tacking, Chris and Debbie were on8the land for 18 years, which satisfies the adverse possession statute of limitations. Even though they were only actually using part of the land, they would have the entirety of Greenacre because of color of title. possessor because she too used the land in an exclusive, open, hostile and continuous way. Like how Chris used it exclusively, she too let the neighbors with permission use the land. She also built a permanent house on Greenacre, showing a continuous usage. Debbie openly used it, by building the house, and was hostile because Betty did not know of the usage and Debbie believed it was hers. Through tacking, Chris and Debbie were on the land for 18 years, which satisfies the adverse possession statute of limitations. Even though they were only actually using part of the land, they would have the entirety of Greenacre because of color of title. Betty will argue that the elements of adverse possession were not met by Chris, and therefore, Debbie can not tack on Chris's time spent on the land. Betty will argue that 8 weeks out of the year is not sufficient for Chris to satisfy the continuous element of adverse possession. If one element of adverse possession is not met then adverse possession as a whole cannot be satisfied. When Debbie then recieved Greenacre through Chris's will, she only adversely possessed the land for 8 years. Depending on the statute of limitations, this time frame of 8 years most likely does not satisfy adverse possession, and the land would still Betty's. An example of continuous possession would be in the Cahill v. Morrow case, where Cahill used the Morrow's land for years continuously by doing activities such as hosting parties, planting in the garden and mowing the lawn. Cahill was using the propery year round for years, not just for 8 weeks out of the year for 8 years as Chris was using Greenacre. Using this case to show what true continuity looks like, Betty has a strong point in stating that Chris's adverse possession was not satisfied, therefore making Debbie's time of actually adverse possessing the land inadequate. To make her arguement stronger, Betty can also say that the neighbors using the land to hunt and fish do not constitute continuous usage when Chris isn't there, because they are not hunting 24/7. It is not a continuous usage for people to occasionally use the land to hunt and fish. Betty can also argue that even though Debbie recieved the land through Chris's will, it was not valid because Andrew forged Betty's signature. Betty will also state that that color of title would only apply once adverse possession is satisfied, which she will again assert, it was not. Out of the two women, I believe Betty has the stronger argument. I do not think that Chris satisfied the element of continuous in the adverse possession requirement by only attending Greenacre for 8 weeks out of the year, even if it was for 8 years and even if he had neighbors using his land with permission when he was absent. I agree with Betty in that the neighbors usage to hunt does not satisfy the continuous element, and therefore Debbie cannot tack on Chris's time on Greenacre to her own time. Debbie would not have satisfied adverse possession and Betty would have the better claim to Greenacre. element of continuous in the adverse possession requirement by only attending Greenacre for 8 weeks out of the year, even if it was for 8 years and even if he had neighbors using his land with permission when he was absent. I agree with Betty in that the neighbors usage to hunt does not satisfy the continuous element, and therefore Debbie cannot tack on Chris's time on Greenacre to her own time. Debbie would not have satisfied adverse possession and Betty would have the better claim to Greenacre. ",691,2162,1300
9fd1fa60-0af8-4a83-8898-a20fc4da9522," Oliver Owner has a reversion. Oliver's first child to retire has a contingent remainder in life estate. It is a contingent remainder because a condition must be satisified (other than Oliver's death) before the interest is vested and the interest is granted in an unascertained person. It is a life estate because it says ""for life"". Robert has a vested remainder in life estate. It is a vested remainder because no condition must be satisified (other than Oliver's death), and Robert is an ascertained person before the interest is vested.It is a life estate because it says ""for life"". Oliver's grandchildren have nothing because their interest ""then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25"" violates the Rule Against Perpituities making it an invalid interest. The grandchildren do not have a contingent remainder subject to open because the validating life plus 21 years that grants their interest is the death of Oliver Owner. It is possible that Oliver's grandchildren are not even born at the time of his death, thus the grandchildren's interest cannot vest within 21 years of Oliver's passing. "," A. The issue is whether Alex and Brock who own the 10 acres of land, including the brewery, as tenants in common, can be forced to sell through a partition by sale. When tenants in common do not get along and cannot agree on how to divide the interests, courts will grant either a partition by sale or a partition in kind. I would instruct Brock that we should petition for a partition by sale which would allow him to buy the entire 10 acres and sell the property to the real estate developer. Brock and Alex are tenants in common, and each tenants hold about 50/100 interest in the property, since expenses for the business and warehouse are split evenly between the brothers, ""Brock pays Alex a sum of money for half of the business and half of the warehouse site"". Brock wants to sell the entire 10 acres, including the brewery, to the developer in order to make a substantial amount of money. The only way Brock would be able to sell to the developer would be through a court ordered sale of the property. Alex is opposed him to buy the entire 10 acres and sell the property to the real estate developer. Brock and Alex are tenants in common, and each tenants hold about 50/100 interest in the property, since expenses for the business and warehouse are split evenly between the brothers, ""Brock pays Alex a sum of money for half of the business and half of the warehouse site"". Brock wants to sell the entire 10 acres, including the brewery, to the developer in order to make a substantial amount of money. The only way Brock would be able to sell to the developer would be through a court ordered sale of the property. Alex is opposed to selling the property and would likely petition the court to order a partition in kind, which would divide the 2 interests, 50/50. In Delfino v Vaelencis, the parties were tenants in common, and the Delfinos (who had 2/3 interest of the property) petitioned the court to order a parition by sale so they could sell the property to a developer. Valencis (who had 1/3 interest in the property) petitioned the court to order a partition in kind because she did not want to sell the property, and owned a trash business and dwelling on the property. The court ruled a parition in kind, and divided the land allowing Vaelencis to keep the property where her business and dwelling were located (about 2 acres out of 20) and pay owelty (ordered by the courts when there is a monetary discrepancy between the interests after a parition in kind is created) to the Delfinos, and the Delfinos recieved the remaining land (18 acres) which they sold. Court's prefer to issue a partion in kind, which is when the interests are divided and the land is physically divided according to each cotenants interest. However, practically speaking courts order a partition by sale when it is not feasible to divide the land, and it makes more sense to order a sale of the land. It is unlikely that a parition by sale would be awarded, seeing as the brewery likely does not encompass a substantial amount of the 10 acres, and it could easily be divided. It is likely the court will order a partion in kind because the land can be physically divided that sufficently correlates to the brothers' interests. B. The issue is whether the coins Carl found are considered treasure trove, embedded, lost, abandoned, or mislaid property and if Carl issued a bailment of his growler and coat while at the brewery. Treasure trove pertains to valuable items, such as jewels, that are found. The property goes goes to the finder who has superior title against everyone but the actual owner. Embedded property is property that is kept safely underground in order to preserve its value or intergrity, the property goes to the owner of the locus who has superior title against everyone but the actual owner. Lost property is property that is accidentally misplaced by the owner and goes to the finder of the property who has superior title against everyone but the actual owner. Abandoned property is property that is voluntarily left behind by the owner and the property goes to the finder who has superior title against everyone but the actual owner. Lastly, mislaid property is property that is not intentionally left behind and usually accidentally forgotten. The property goes to the owner of the locus who has superior title against property that is kept safely underground in order to preserve its value or intergrity, the property goes to the owner of the locus who has superior title against everyone but the actual owner. Lost property is property that is accidentally misplaced by the owner and goes to the finder of the property who has superior title against everyone but the actual owner. Abandoned property is property that is voluntarily left behind by the owner and the property goes to the finder who has superior title against everyone but the actual owner. Lastly, mislaid property is property that is not intentionally left behind and usually accidentally forgotten. The property goes to the owner of the locus who has superior title against everyone but the actual own. McAvoy v Medina. Gold coins can be considered treasure, because gold is a valuable metal. Carl could argue the gold coins he found are his, unless the true owner comes along, under the theory of treasure trove. However, many jurisdictions prefer not to enforce the theory of treasure trove because it encourages people to tresspass on land and look for valueable items. In Corliss.the court held silver coins found and unearthed during construction were embedded property and not treasure trove, thus the owner of the property was awarded the item. Carl could also argue the coins were abandoned or lost, because he would still be able to keep them as the finder, and the owners of the locus are not entitled to keep the coins. If Carl were to argue the coins are embedded or mislaid, the coins would not go to him, the finder, they would go to the owners of locus, which is Alex and Brock. In regards to Carl's lost growler and jacket, in order to recover damages he would have to argue a bailment was created at the time he handed the bartender his growler and hung up his jacket. Bailments are created when the owner of the property (bailor) grants temporary possession to another party (bailee) through delivery. If the property is damaged or destroyed while in possession of the bailee, either the bailee or bailor are entitled to recover damages, but not both parties. In the Hyatt Nashville case, a bailment was created when the bailor parked his car in a parking garage recieved a ticket stub, and a guard and security who roamed the garage and connecting hotel, which induced the bailor to believe his property would be protected while in possession of the bailee. Brock could argue he and the bartender entered a bailment when he handed the growler over the counter and recieved a claim ticket and tag for the growler with matching numbers. The growler was delivered to the bartender, who had temporary possession so he could fill the bailor's growler with the new beer. The bartender suggested another bartender, who is new, dropped the growler. Either the bailor (Carl) or bailee ( first bartender) should seek damages from the bartender who dropped the growler to be awarded to Carl.The bartender could argue no bailment was created, and the ticket is an automated receipt; however, it is not a strong argument since the bartender intended to relieve his right of possession back to the bailor once he filled the growler with beer. Lastly, Brock's legal rights in regard to his coat do not strongly support the idea of a bailment being temporary possession so he could fill the bailor's growler with the new beer. The bartender suggested another bartender, who is new, dropped the growler. Either the bailor (Carl) or bailee ( first bartender) should seek damages from the bartender who dropped the growler to be awarded to Carl.The bartender could argue no bailment was created, and the ticket is an automated receipt; however, it is not a strong argument since the bartender intended to relieve his right of possession back to the bailor once he filled the growler with beer. Lastly, Brock's legal rights in regard to his coat do not strongly support the idea of a bailment being created. The brewery will argue no bailment was created, and the brewery never became the bailor for Brock's jacket. Brock did not deliver the item to another party, like he did when he handed the bartender his growler. Brock could argue he granted a possessory right to the entire establishment when he hung up his coat, but it is unlikely a court will find a bailment was created simply by hanging up a coat. C. The issue with Alex's conveyance David for 5 acres is whether the executory limiation created will allow him to regain possession of the interest. The conveyance grants a fee simple subject to executory limitations for David, and a shifting executory interest to Alex's sons Frank and Fred. Alex has nothing.The conveyance allows Frank and Fred to cut short the present possessory interest of David if David ever uses the property for non-residental uses. Since Alex created a conveyance that grants him nothing, since the executory interest is not springing, he will not be able to make a claim against David. However, his sons will be able to take possession of the 5 acres since David violated the terms of the coveyance. The issue with Alex's conveyance to Edward for 5 acres is whether the possessory interest created is a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. If the conveyance is a fee simple determinable, the grantor has a reversion in the interest. If the conveyance is a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the grantor has a right of reentry. The distinction between fee simple determinable or fee simple subject to condition subsequent is the language used in conveyance; if it is language of duration such as ""during"" ""for so long as"" it is determinable and if the language is of conditions such as ""but, if"" or ""on the condition that"" it is subject to condition subsequent. Alex could argue the conveyance created a possessory interest to Edward for a fee simple determinable since the language ""so long as"" was used. The fee simple determinable would grant an interest in himself for a reversion, which means Alex automatically gets Edward's interest if he violated the terms of the conveyance by using the premises to make IPAs. Edward could argue the conveyance created a fee simple subject to condition subsequent for himself, the grantee, and a right of reenty to Alex, the grantor. A right of reentry would mean Edward would have to take action to get the land back once Edward violated the terms. language ""so long as"" was used. The fee simple determinable would grant an interest in himself for a reversion, which means Alex automatically gets Edward's interest if he violated the terms of the conveyance by using the premises to make IPAs. Edward could argue the conveyance created a fee simple subject to condition subsequent for himself, the grantee, and a right of reenty to Alex, the grantor. A right of reentry would mean Edward would have to take action to get the land back once Edward violated the terms. 3) "," The legal issue is whether Betty owns Greenacre because the deed from her husband, Andrew, while she and Andrew were tenants in entirety to Chris was invalid, or if Debbie owns the land through adverse possession. Tenants in entirerty are when the tenants are married and own equal interests in the land. One spouse cannot unilaterally convey interest without consent of their spouse. In US v Kraft, a husband and wife were tenants in entirety and the husband owed federal taxes.The federal government attached a lien to their property. Although, generally liens occured by one spouse who share a property as tenants in entirety cannot attach to the property, federal statutes (which allowed for the loan to attach to the couple's property) overpower the state property rights. Additionally, severance of tenants in entirety can only occur when one spouse dies or if the couple gets divorced. When Betty's husband forged a deed to Chris for Greenacre in 2001, it was not a valid conveyance because Betty did not convey her interest, Andrew forged her signature. Thus, Betty could claim Debbie has been squatting on her land, and is not the true owner of the property since the deed is invalid. However, adverse possession is established when the use of the land is open and notorious, continuous, exlusive, and actual/adverse/hostile for a certain period of time, defined as being 10 years for the jurisdicition of New Suffolk. The first adverse possessor was Chris, because he moved onto the land after recieving what he thought was a valid, executed deed from Betty and Andrew in 2001. Chris established all elements of adverse possession since continued to use the land ever season, and the true owner (Andrew) recognized the land as being Chris's, and Chris objectively believed he held superior title to the land (which is irrelevant in bad faith jurisdictions such as Maine where the adverse possesor can occupy the land during the statutory period knowing it belongs to a different owner, and still achieve valid title through adverse possesion). The time period for the adverse possession continued, through privity, when the land was voluntarily conveyed from the prior possesor, Chris, to his daughter, Debbie, in residence. Once Betty discovered Debbie was 2009. Debbie used the vacation property as her primary residing at Greenacre in 2019, Chris and Debbie had already established valid title to the land through adverse possesion since 2001 (when Chris recieved the forged deed and used the property as his (which is irrelevant in bad faith jurisdictions such as Maine where the adverse possesor can occupy the land during the statutory period knowing it belongs to a different owner, and still achieve valid title through adverse possesion). The time period for the adverse possession continued, through privity, when the land was voluntarily conveyed from the prior possesor, Chris, to his daughter, Debbie, in 2009. Debbie used the vacation property as her primary residence. Once Betty discovered Debbie was residing at Greenacre in 2019, Chris and Debbie had already established valid title to the land through adverse possesion since 2001 (when Chris recieved the forged deed and used the property as his vacation home for every fishing season). The statute of limitations is 10 years in New Suffolk, and Betty was acting like a sleepy owner, who took too long (18 years) to argue her property was being wrongfully possessed by another person, being Debbie.

499fc744-a3e7-4927-afd5-b4df47ca7874," O Grants property ""to the first of my children to retire, for life, then to my nephew Robert for life, then to my grandchildren who reach the age of 25"" Oliver and Robert are both alive Oliver has 2 children alive at the time of the grant Connor & Carla (both work at the time) Oliver has two grandchildren at the time of the grant Victor - 26 Vivian - 17 To answer this question, we first look at the language of the question to determine who has the present interest(s) and who has the future interest(s) of the property conveyed by Oliver. The language, ""to the first of my children to retire, for life,"" creates a vested remainder subject to open in Oliver's children Connor and Carla "," 10 years SoL or 7 years after disability is removed A. Delfino v. Vaelencis To begin we need to answer the question of what rights do both Brock and Alex have to the property, 10 years SoL or 7 years after disability is removed A. Delfino v. Vaelencis To begin we need to answer the question of what rights do both Brock and Alex have to the property, both the warehouse and 10 acres of land? This is a question of the rights to partition property of cotenants. In Delfino v. Vaelencis, we learned that cotenants have interest in their portion of the property but also interest in the property as a whole. This means each cotenants has a right to exclude, possess, rent, convey, destroy the property as a whole as long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of the other cotenants. Provided the language when Alex invited Brock to join him in business in 2003, he stated,"" I, Alex Apple hereby grant this land to myself and my brother Brock to hold jointly as tenants in common."" We presume tenants in common, unless circumstantial evidence provides otherwise. For a joint tenancy, there would need to be explicit language of a survivorship, which ""tenants in common"" does not satisfy and the 4 elements of posession, interest, title, and time are not satisfied. Because the explicit language isn't satisfied we don't need to go deeper in to the 4 elements, but if we did, the elements of time and title are not satified because Brock gained title to the property at a later time than Alex. In addition this is not a tenancy in entirety because not only are the elements of explicit language of survivorship not met and the 4 elements of time, title, interest, and possesion, the brothers are not married. Like in Delfino v. vaelencis, Brock has the right to file a complaint to have the land partitioned because he has interest in the property in entirety. Brock has the option to file a partition by sale or a partition in kind. Brock will want to argue for a partition of the property in kind because the brothers have an equal interest in both the land and business thus the entire proceeds from the sale will be split evenly. Whereas a partition in sale, gives the interest in the portion of the property a weighted price due to the market value and outside factors. Because Brock paid for half of the business and half of the land, the brothers would recieve fair amounts to the price of the property. In addition this is easier for the courts and is favorable to all parties. Brock can argue that with the money recieved through the sale, which is much more than they paid for land, Alex can buy another piece of land ""not too far away and move the brewery there,"" thus this benefits all the parties involved. interest in both the land and business thus the entire proceeds from the sale will be split evenly. Whereas a partition in sale, gives the interest in the portion of the property a weighted price due to the market value and outside factors. Because Brock paid for half of the business and half of the land, the brothers would recieve fair amounts to the price of the property. In addition this is easier for the courts and is favorable to all parties. Brock can argue that with the money recieved through the sale, which is much more than they paid for land, Alex can buy another piece of land ""not too far away and move the brewery there,"" thus this benefits all the parties involved. Alex's best argument to stop the court to partition the property is that it isn't beneficial to both parties at hand. Similarly in Delfino, Alex has his brewery on the property which he has put hard work, effort, and is becoming successful. There is sentimental value in the property because Alex has built the brewery from the ground up and thus a partition to the property is beneficial to both parties at hand. If it does come down to it, and the court allows a partition in kind, Alex can request an owelty, which is monetary remedy that forces Brock to pay Alex the detrimental loss of value (intangible), to compensate for losing his successful business and livelihood. After looking at both sides of the argument the court would likely rule in favor of Brock and do a partition in kind with an owelty, because the sale would benefit all parties involved and the owelty would provide in the sentimental loss that Alex recieved similarly in the Delfino case. In addition the court looks at how the sale affects the general public and would like the economic value added to putting up the condos, providing more housing for people in the growing city of Bostonia. The court is in the business of creating a good economy for everyone involved. B. The first issue in question relates to found property and we have to ask if Carl has the right to coins found in the floor? Found property as an overarching term belongs to the finder against the world except the rightful owner. There are four types of found property: abandoned, lost, mislaid, and treasure trove. For abandoned property, the owner relinquishes all title to the property and it belongs to the finder against the entire world, even the prior possessor/owner. For lost property, the owner literally loses site/possession of the world except for the rightful owner. Mislaid property, and it belongs to the finder against the entire property is when the owner places the property somewhere and then forgets where they place it. This belongs to the person who owns the premise where the property is found against everyone except the Found property as an overarching term belongs to the finder against the world except the rightful owner. There are four types of found property: abandoned, lost, mislaid, and treasure trove. For abandoned property, the owner relinquishes all title to the property and it belongs to the finder against the entire world, even the prior possessor/owner. For lost property, the owner literally loses site/possession of the property, and it belongs to the finder against the entire world except for the rightful owner. Mislaid property is when the owner places the property somewhere and then forgets where they place it. This belongs to the person who owns the premise where the property is found against everyone except the rightful owner. This is because we presume that the rightful owner will retrace their steps and go looking for the mislaid property. Finally, there's treasure trove which is when a person intentionally places older, antique items with the intention to be found later, but then forgets about the items. This belongs to the finder of the property. Carl's best argument is that the coins are lost property, like in Armory v. Delamirie, the chimney boy found the jewel in good faith while sweeping the chimney, Carl found the coins when he dropped his wallet. In addition, the coins were in a hole in the flooring of the warehouse and it is likely that they coins fell out of the person's pocket and into the hole. This would constitute lost property and thus, Carl would be entitled to possession against the entire world except the rightful possessor. Unlike in McAvoy v. Medina where the wallet was sitting on the table, the coins were in a hole in the ground which portrays lost property rather than mislaid property. Carl next could argue abandoned property because that way he has the right to posession against everyone, even the rightful owner. Carl could argue that the rightful owner abandoned the property because they were nicely put away and hidden. Even if the rightful owner placed them there on purpose, being worth $20,000 could mean there was potentially illegal activity surrounding the coins. If that were the case, and it was thief who stole the coins, they have no title to give or take so Carl would have possession of the coins against the entire world. Carl's final argument is that the property is considered treasure trove. The coins are from the 1800's and were logged into the flooring of the business, which who knows how long the warehouse has been up. In addition the coins were in a bag and placed in the flooring which we can make a reasonable conclusion that the rightful owner put them there for safe keeping and that they would come back. This way he would be able to keep the coins against everyone but the rightful owner, who probably no longer around. This only issue is that the bag is from a grocery store that open 10 years ago. The defense would utilize Benjamin v. Lindnor Aviation and Corliss v. Wenner and say that the coins are mislaid property. In Benjamin v. Lindnor Aviation, the court concluded that the property was mislaid because the money was wrapped nicely and stored in the wing of the plane. Similary the coins were back. This way he would be able to keep the coins against everyone but the rightful owner, who probably no longer around. This only issue is that the bag is from a grocery store that open 10 years ago. The defense would utilize Benjamin v. Lindnor Aviation and Corliss v. Wenner and say that the coins are mislaid property. In Benjamin v. Lindnor Aviation, the court concluded that the property was mislaid because the money was wrapped nicely and stored in the wing of the plane. Similary the coins were found in a bag and found in a hole in the flooring. Finding the coins in a bag in a weird place such as flooring leads someone to believe that the property was purposely placed there with intentions of the owner coming back. In addition, in Corliss v. Wenner, the coins were dug up under the driveway. Which because the case was in Idaho, the propety was considered imbedded which translates to mislaid is Suffolk County jurisdiction because they were carefully wrapped and placed in such a strange spot. In both cases we learn that mislaid property belongs to the owner of the premise of which the property is found in presumption that the rightful owner will come back looking for the property. The court would likely rule that because the coins were solely in a bag from a grocery store that opened 10 years ago and that they were in a hole in the flooring, that the coins constitute lost property and that Carl is the rightful posessor against the world except the rightful owner. The second issue that Carl is asking is whether his growler and coat were under a bailment with the brewery? In Ford v. Hyatt, we learn that a bailment is when a bailor (the owner of the property) gives the bailee (the person ""watching over"" the property) his/her property for a certain time being. In order for a bailment to happen, the bailee needs to take possession of the property. In addition, if there is a bailment, the bailee is liable for the porperty and has a duty of reasonable care in relation to the property. Bailment as to the Growler Carl will want to argue that there was a bailment because the bartender gave him a slip and attached it to the growler itself. In doing this, the bartender claim ownership of the growler for the time that the job to fill the growler with beer and then give it growler was being filled with beer. It was the bartender back to Carl. In doing so this created a bailment and it was the bartenders duty to reasonable care of Carl's property (aka the growler). Bailment as to the Growler Carl will want to argue that there was a bailment because the bartender gave him a slip and attached it to the growler itself. In doing this, the bartender claim ownership of the growler for the time that the growler was being filled with beer. It was the bartender job to fill the growler with beer and then give it back to Carl. In doing so this created a bailment and it was the bartenders duty to reasonable care of Carl's property (aka the growler). The bartender will want to argue that there was not bailment because the ticket was solely to know who's growler it was. In addition, there was no security or someone watching the growlers at all times and thus the bartender did not enter into a bailment. The bartender did not take full possession of the growler, which the dissent in Ford v. Hyatt argues that does not constitute a bailment. Bailment as to the Coat Carl will want to argue that when he left his coat on the coat rack, it created a bailment with the brewery because by the brewery creating a place to hang customers' coats they're implying a duty of reasonable care to the coats. In addition, providing a coat rack to hang a coat shows that they are taking possession of the property for the time being. The brewery will argue that the coat rack was there for customers to use, but that there was no security, no ticketed exchange, and out in the open presence of everybody in the area. THis provides that the brewery never took full possession of the coat, thus not creating a bailment. The court will likely rule that a bailment was created in regards to the growler but not the coat, because the growler was behind the bar (an enclosed space), with the bartender and Carl was given a claim ticket as to the growler, where the coat was hung in the open and nobody was watching the coat. C. This is an issue of whether ""so long as"" creates a fee simple subject to condition subsequent or if it conveys a fee simple subject determinable or an executory limitation in both David and Edward? This is the growler was behind the bar (an enclosed space), with the bartender and Carl was given a claim ticket as to the growler, where the coat was hung in the open and nobody was watching the coat. C. This is an issue of whether ""so long as"" creates a fee simple subject to condition subsequent or if it conveys a fee simple subject determinable or an executory limitation in both David and Edward? This is a big deal because if the interest is a fee simple subject to condition subsequent than if the condition isn't met, Alex would have the right to re-entry but he would need to step in a claim the title. If the interest is a fee simple determinable than Alex would automically have the possibility of reverter when the duration clause isn't met, meaning the he would automatically recieve title of the land. David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation because if he doesn't meet the limitation, the property goes to a third party (other than the grantor), which are the children of Alex. The children would have a contingent remainder becuase David hasn't officially built the commercial usage on the property. When that does happen the children (Frank and Fred) will have a vested remainder subject to open because there could be more children. It's valid under RAP because it will vest or fail within their lifetime +21 years. They are life in beings because they were alive at the time of conveyance. Alex has an executory interest in fee simple meaning he can take the property back if David fails. Edward would want a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. This way Alex has the right to re- entry and would have to claim title to the property. The language of ""To Edward and his heirs so long as the premises are never used tomake IPA's and if ..."" conveys language that it's based upon a condition and that it would be going back to the grantor not a third party thus he has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and Alex has the right to re-entry. Finally Alex would want to argue fee simple executory limitation or fee simple subject determinable because in doing this he would automatically take back the properties if the conditions were not met. "," The issue is whether Debbie has adversly possessed title of the 50 acres of property? In order to adversely possess another propety you must meet the requirement of continuous, hostile, exclusive, actual, notorious, and open for the statute of limitation which in this case is 10 years because there were no disabilities. Continuous is relative to the customs of the property and means that the adverse possesor needs to continuously using the property, Exclusive means that the adverse possesor had ownership of the property, actual meaning physical presence, notorious and open meaning the current possessers knew the adverse posessor was clearly taking the property, and finally hostile meaning you made it clear you were taking it. Two minority rules are good faith and bad faith jurisdiction. Bad faith jurisdication require that the adverse possesor knows it's someone else property and clearly takes it, where good faith provides that the adverse possessor doesn't know it's someone else's property. Debbie's argument: Satisfies Statute of Limitations Privity- tack on the time of her father and her because the property was conveyed through a will, thus making the property adversely possesed for more than 10 years. Though sale from Andrew to Chris was forged, because Chris was acting in good faith, he gained possession of the property through color of title. Like in Tieu v. Morgan Continuous Chris built a small wooden cabin, went for walks, hunted, and visited regularly through the fishing year. When Debbie recieved it, she built a year-round house and moved there. Like in Cahill v. Morrow Hostile Chris bought the property and took possesion of the property through the color of title purchase. Continuous Chris built a small wooden cabin, went for walks, hunted, and visited regularly through the fishing year. When Debbie recieved it, she built a year-round house and moved there. Like in Cahill v. Morrow Hostile Chris bought the property and took possesion of the property through the color of title purchase. Exclusive Though Chris let his neighbors hunt and fish on the land, he only allowed it when he wasn't there. Thus we can infer that they asked him for permission to go onto the property. Like in Tieu v. Morgan. Open/notorious Andrew clearly knew that Chris was taking the property because he conveyed it to him Betty would want to argue that through her interest of the acres through tenants by entirety she had ownership of the entire acres. In U.S v. Craft, they were able to apply the the federal tax to the entirety of the tenants by entirety property because it showed that each tenants by entirety owned interest in the property as a whole. Thus because Betty owned the interest in the entirety of the 50 acres the element of open and notorious was not satisfied by Debbie, because she didn't know the property was conveyed. Like in Marengo Cave were it was reasonable that the property owner didn't know that the cave was within his property. thus adverse possesion did not occur. She could also potentially argue that the property wasn't exclusive because the neighbors came on the land and used it to hunt and fish. The court would conlude that because Betty and Andrew were tenants by the entirety, the fact that Andrew knew, and the rest of the elements of adverse possesion were satified including the statute of limitation, that Debbie has adversely possessed the 50 acres.

1d698e1e-12e9-4f01-83bc-037873584519," The first child to retire has a contingent remainder in life estate. It is contingent because it is not yet ascertained which child will be the first to retire. Once the child retires, he or she will have a vested remainder in life estate. It becomes vested once the child who is the first to retire is ascertained and the interest is certain to vest in that person. Robert has a vested remainder in a life estate. It is indefeasibly vested because he will certainly obtain the future interest. Victor has a vested remainder subject to open. It is subject to open because he is an ascertained class member, but more may join. Vivian and any other future grandchildren who reach 25 have a contingent remainder in fee simple. It is contingent because they must reach age 25. It is a fee simple because there are no limiting words, such as ""for life."" The Rule Against Perpetuitities (RAP) applies to: contingent remainders, executory interests, and vested remainders subject to an open class. An interest is valid under RAP if it will necessarily vest or fail within a validating life plus 21 years. A validating life is someone who is alive at the time of conveyance, typically related to the interest. The RAP seeks to limit dead-hand control into the future. The first- retired child's contingent remainder is not valid under RAP because Oliver could have another child tomorrow and then die, so the new child is not alive at the time of the coveyance. This child could retire in more than 21 years, while the two current living children are still alive and working. Under the rule of convenience, Victor's vested remainder subject to open is valid. The rule allows for someone who has already met the requirements to obtain the interest do so, even if other potential class members may be void in the future. Vivian's contingent interest is valid under the RAP because she is alive at the time of the conveyance, so she is her own life in being. The other grandchildren's interest who reach 25 is void because Oliver and all of his children, except one, may die. This remaining child could eventually have her own baby, but die a year later. There will no longer be any lives in being and the interest will not vest in 21 years because the child must reach 25. The new language of the grant would be: ""to Robert for life, then to Victor and Vivian."" "," 1a. Alex and Brock share the land as tenants in common. Tenancy in common is the default concurrent her own baby, but die a year later. There will no longer be any lives in being and the interest will not vest in 21 years because the child must reach 25. The new language of the grant would be: ""to Robert for life, then to Victor and Vivian."" 2) 1a. Alex and Brock share the land as tenants in common. Tenancy in common is the default concurrent estate. The language in the deed is not strong enough to create a joint tenancy. The deed says ""jointly as tenants in common,"" but this is not enough. To create a joint tenancy it must have explicitly stated ""to Alex and Brock as joint tenants with a right of survivorship."" Tenants in common share a fractional interest in the property, with a whole right to occupy, use, possess, and exclude the land. Tenants in common can pass on their interests, either in life or upon death. Unlike a tenancy in common, a joint tenancy is created with explicit language plus the four unities of time (received simultaneously), title (received through the same document), interest (undivided interest), and possession (right to possess the whole). A joint tenancy is also associated with a right of survivorship. This means that at one tenant's death, his interest ceases to exist, and is instead given to the remaining tenants. A joint tenant may not grant his interest in a will. As tenants in common, Brock can request a partition by sale or a partition in kind. A partition by sale is when the property is sold and each tenant receives their share of the profits. A partition in kind is a physical partition, giving each tenant a piece of the property. Courts traditionally prefer to grant partition in kind, but in reality more often grant partition by sale. A partition in kind is hard to grant because parts of the property will have differing values based on their location. If one side of the property has a great view of a city, then it is more valuable than another side. If Brock wants a partition by sale, he will have to prove two things. First, that a partition in kind is almost impossible due to the physical characteristics of the property. Second, that a partition by sale will best serve the interests of all parties. The court is unlikely to grant Brock a partition by sale. Property rights are intended to serve human values, and the court will look into personal attachments to the land. Alex is emotionally invested in the land. In Delfino, the courts refused to grant a partition by sale because one of the tenants was deeply attached to the garbage business she operated on the property, which had been in her family for years. 1b. The bag of gold coins found by Carl could be either lost, abandoned, mislaid, or treasure trove. His rights to the coins depend on which of these categories the coins are held to be. Lost property is not voluntarily given up by the true owner. The court held in Armory that a finder of lost property has a right to the property, good against all except the true owner. Abandoned property is voluntarily given up by the true owner. A finder of abandoned property has a right good against all, including the true owner. Mislaid property is property that is intentionally placed but forgotten about. Mislaid property goes to the owner of the property on which they are found, in hopes that the true owner will return to the place looking to claim their property. The courts rarely recognize treasure trove in an effort to discourage trespassing. Treasure trove belongs to the finder, good against all except the true owner, although the true owner is likely dead. In Corliss, the court held that the coins found by construction workers in a homeowner's driveway belonged to the homeowner. The bag of coins are likely mislaid. In determining whether property is mislaid, courts look to where the property is found. In the case with the wallet at the barbershop, the wallet was found on a counter, so it was determined that the owner placed it down intentionally but then forgot about it. Carl found the coins embedded in the wall of the warehouse, so it is unlikely that they are lost. Someone probably placed the coins here to hide them, but forgot to return for them. The coins are probably not abandoned because it is unlikely that someone willingly wanted to give them up, since they are worth $20,000. If the court holds that the coins are mislaid property, then Carl will not have a claim to them. They will instead go to Alex and Brock, the owners of the property on which they were found. Carl still has a property claim in his coat. If Carl thought he left it on a hook where he looked for it, but it turns out he put it down on the ground when he picked up the coins, then it is lost property. He did not voluntarily give up his coat. If someone finds the coat on the ground, that finder will have a claim good against everyone, except Carl. Another possibility is that Carl did leave his coat on a hook, but it was stolen before he went to get it. In Kotis, the court held that a thief cannot acquire good title to property. Even if the thief later sold the coat to a good-faith purchaser, the purchaser still would not acquire a valid title. Therefore, Carl still owns his coat. In Carl giving his growler to the bar is likely a bailment. 7 a bailment, a bailor is the person who temporarily gives his property over. The bailee is the person who temporarily takes possesion of the property. In this case, Carl is the bailor and the bar is the bailee. Carl voluntarily gave his growler to the good against everyone, except Carl. Another possibility is that Carl did leave his coat on a hook, but it was stolen before he went to get it. In Kotis, the court held that a thief cannot acquire good title to property. Even if the thief later sold the coat to a good-faith purchaser, the purchaser still would not acquire a valid title. Therefore, Carl still owns his coat. Carl giving his growler to the bar is likely a bailment. In a bailment, a bailor is the person who temporarily gives his property over. The bailee is the person who temporarily takes possesion of the property. In this case, Carl is the bailor and the bar is the bailee. Carl voluntarily gave his growler to the bartender for a temporary period of time, and the bartender exercised enough control over Carl's property. In Hyatt Nashville, a car owner parked his car in a parking garage with attendants, and his handing over the car temporarily was determined to be a bailment. In this case, the car owner took a ticket as he entered the garage that had to be shown upon leaving the garage. Similarly, Carl was given a ticket to later claim his growler. If this is determined to be a bailment, then the bailee has the burden of proving that they were not negligent. The bailee's negligence is assumed. It will likely be ruled that the bartender dropping the growler was negligent. The bartender tripped because she was distracted by another employee who dropped a glass. The bartender may have been found not negligent if someone bumped into her, causing her to drop the growler. 4) 1c. In analyzing the interests of a deed, a court must look at the language as a whole to determine the intent of the grantor. Language of mere hope, desire, or purpose is not enough to create a defeasbile fee because courts want to limit restrictions on the use of property. Here, the language of the grant goes beyond mere hope, desire, or purpose. The grant to David is ambiguous. The words ""so long as"" create a fee simple determinable because these are words of time/duration. However, the following phrase, ""if it is ever used.."" are words of condition. This creates a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because ""if"" is a word of condition. When the language of the grant is ambiguous, the court applies a presumption of fee simple subject to condition subsequent in order to prevent the land from changing hands. This was determined in Marenholz, where the deed granted an interest to property ""only"" if it was to be used for school purposes. A fee simple subject to condition subsequent is followed by a right of entry, which must be exercised. A fee simple determinable is followed by possibility of reverter, which is automatically applied. Both right of entry and possibility of reverter are future interests in the grantor. Executory interests are granted to a third-party Frank and Fred have an executory interest in fee simple. and cut short another's interest. If David uses the land for non-residential purposes, then David's interest is cut short by Frank and Fred. ""only"" if it was to be used for school purposes. A fee simple subject to condition subsequent is followed by a right of entry, which must be exercised. A fee simple determinable is followed by possibility of reverter, which is automatically applied. Both right of entry and possibility of reverter are future interests in the grantor. Frank and Fred have an executory interest in fee simple. Executory interests are granted to a third-party and cut short another's interest. If David uses the land for non-residential purposes, then David's interest is cut short by Frank and Fred. The deed for Edward's interests is also ambiguous. The language ""so long as"" creates a fee simple determinable. However, it later says ""Alex has a right to re-enter."" A right of re-entry is associated with a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Using Marenholz, the court will likely again rule Edward's interest as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, because this is the preference when the language is ambiguous. If both David's and Edward's interests are held as fee simple subject to condition subsequent, then they will lose their interests in the property. They were granted title to the property, but it can be taken away once a condition subsequent is met. The conditions are using the land for non-residential purposes and using the land for making IPAs. "," 2. A tenancy by the entirety requires the four unities of a joint tenancy plus marriage. A tenancy by the entirety is severed by divorce, although Betty and Andrew never divorced. Unlike a joint tenancy, a tenant from a tenancy by the entirety may not unilaterally transfer his interest, which was determined in Craft. This requires mutual agreement from both parties. Since Betty did not agree to sell Greenacre, the title never transferred over to Chris when Andrew forged Betty's name on the deed. Debbie has a claim to the land through adverse possession. The requirements for adverse possession are: hostile, continuous, open/notorious, actual, and exclusive. Hostile means using the land without permission. The minority rule requires either a good faith or bad faith mistake as to hostility. In Tieu, the adverse possessors made a good faith mistake because they truly believed they owned the land in question. This satisfied the Oregon statute requiring good faith. If they were acting in bad faith, knowing that it was not their property, then they would not have satisfied the requirement. However, the majority rule is that the intent of the possessor is irrelevant. Therefore, it does not matter that Chris thought he owned the land because he was still using it without permission. The use of the land is continuous because Debbie acquired it in 2009 and it is now 2019, which satisfied the ten year statutory period. If Debbie had only been on the property for two years, then she could tack on Chris's years to satisfy the adverse possessors made a good faith mistake because they truly believed they owned the land in question. This satisfied the Oregon statute requiring good faith. If they were acting in bad faith, knowing that it was not their property, then they would not have satisfied the requirement. However, the majority rule is that the intent of the possessor is irrelevant. Therefore, it does not matter that Chris thought he owned the land because he was still using it without permission. The use of the land is continuous because Debbie acquired it in 2009 and it is now 2019, which satisfied the ten year statutory period. If Debbie had only been on the property for two years, then she could tack on Chris's years to satisfy the ten year period. The rule for tacking allows a current owner to tack on a prior owner's years as long as the transfer of property is voluntary. The continuous requirement is determined based on the property. The property is a rustic hunting and fishing camp set in the mountains with a small cabin. This is not the type of property where someone would live full time. Chris occupied the cabin for eight weeks a year, which is likely considered normal for a small cabin.The use is open because it is clearly visible that the property is being used. Debbie built a house on the property. If Betty visited the property, then she clearly would have seen that the property is being used. The use is actual because Debbie and Chris acted as normal owners would. Chris enlarged and insulated the cabin, and Debbie built a garden. The use is exclusive, even though the neighbors have permission to use the property for hunting. The exclusivity requirement does not require completely exlcuding everyone from the property. Debbie has satisfied the statutory period plus the requirements to give her a valid claim to the land through adverse possession. Debbie also has a color of title. A color of title is a deed that is thought to be valid by the titleholder, but is not. Therefore, the owner mistakenly believes that he has a valid right to the property via the deed. Chris had no reason to believe that Andrew would forge Betty's signature. Chris determined the title to be valid and passed it onto his daughter, Debbie. A color of title gives the adverse possesor a claim to the entire property, not just the part that they are using. However, if the true owner occupies the land, then the adverse possessor only can claim the area of the land that they are using. Therefore, Debbie would have title to the entire Greenacre property. Although she only uses the two acres around her house, Betty does not occupy the property. ",417,1761,719
9ccdbe20-6acd-472a-910e-4470b2feb6bb," Connor and Carla have future interst in a contingent remainder in life estate subject to complete divestment. Robert has future interest in a vested remainder in life estate. Victor has future interest in a vested remainder in fee simple subject to open. Vivian has future interest in a contingent remainder in fee simple, subject to open. Oliver has a future interest in reversion. The Rule against perpetuties (RAP) was designed by courts to help limit dead hand control when it comes to the conveyance of property. The courts determined that an interest must vest during the life in being plus twenty-one years and if it fails, then the interest is voided. In the case of Oliver's will, the clause with his grandchildren violates the RAP. Despite the fact that oliver already has two grandchildren that have an interest that will vest within the required period of time, it still violates RAP. The grant violates RAP because the life in being, the first child to retire, could have a child right before he dies that would not vest within 21 years, additionally, when the first child to retire dies, Oliver's other child may have grandchildren that would not vest within the 21 years. The re-written will should be ""To the first of my children to retire, for life, then to my nephew Robert for life"" "," 1a. Dear Brock, When you bought half of the business and half of the warehouse site from your brother he gave you a tenancy in common with both of you owning 1/2 half of the interest of the property and business respectively. You have a tenacy in common because your brother granted ownership to both of you as ""joint tenants in common"" and courts are usually hesitant to grant a joint tenancy unless the wording is extremely specific such as wording like ""joint tenancy with right of survivorship. Tenants in common have an equal right to use the property as tehy please, so you could use the other unoccupied land for your own interest. As you own half of the interest in the property in a tenancy in common you have a tenancy in common with both of you owning 1/2 half of the interest of the property and business respectively. You have a tenacy in common because your brother granted ownership to both of you as ""joint tenants in common"" and courts are usually hesitant to grant a joint tenancy unless the wording is extremely specific such as wording like ""joint tenancy with right of survivorship. Tenants in common have an equal right to use the property as tehy please, so you could use the other unoccupied land for your own interest. As you own half of the interest in the property in a tenancy in common you have a few options of what to do with your property. Firstly, you could transfer title by selling your 1/2 interest in the property to another interested party. This would keep intact the tenancy in common and the purchasor would then enter a tenancy in common with your brother Alex, owning your 1/2 interest in the property. Another option is that you could try demand rent from your brother. When your brother said ""get out of here and don't come back"" you could argue that you were ousted from the property. This right is shown in the case Martin v. Martin. There, the court deemed that a tenant in common could not demand rent from another tenant in common that was the only one one using or occupying the land unless the tenant in common demanding rent was ousted. Here, you could make the case that you have been ousted by your brother from using the property, as is your right, and thus may be able to demand rent from him for his exclusive use of the property. However, Alex may refute this claim by saying that he did not actually meant to oust you, and he was in a heat of passion, and that you could come back and return to the property anytime you want. Nevertheless, you have a strong claim and evidence that you were ousted from the property and a court may find that you can rightly demand rent from Alex. Another possibility you could do with your 1/2 interest as a tenant in common is opt for a partition- by-sale, as shown in Delfino. There, two tenants in common owned a large tract of land. One tenant in common party wished to sell the land to a real estate developer for a sizeable amount of money and demanded a partition by sale. The other tenant in common had owned and operated a business on a portion of the land and did not want to sell her property and instead demanded a partition-in-kind. The court held that in order for a partition by sale to occur, there must be significant economic benefit to all parties, or the land be too difficult to divide fairly into a partition-in-kind. The court also showed a preference for partition-in-kind when possible and take into account sentimental value of property with respect to the joint tenants. This case is extremely similar to your situation and you could ask the court to commence a partition by sale and earn 1/ the 2 million dollars as that is the interest you own in the property. You could argue that the 2 million dollars offered by the real estate development company is a significant economic benefit and that your brother Alex could easily move his brewery to another plot of land with the money from the sale. You could also argue that the warehouse is the only structure of parties, or the land be too difficult to divide fairly into a partition-in-kind. The court also showed a preference for partition-in-kind when possible and take into account sentimental value of property with respect to the joint tenants. This case is extremely similar to your situation and you could ask court the to commence a partition by sale and earn 1/ the 2 million dollars as that is the interest you own in the property. You could argue that the 2 million dollars offered by the real estate development company is a significant economic benefit and that your brother Alex could easily move his brewery to another plot of land with the money from the sale. You could also argue that the warehouse is the only structure of value on the proeprty and would not be possible to divide fairly between both of you in a partition in kind. Therefore, you have a strong claim to persuade the argument to rule for a partition by sale of the property. However, Alex will likely argue that he has significant sentimental attachment to the warehouse and the brewery and demand a partition in kind, which as shown in Delfino, the court does take into account. Nevertheless, you can argue despite the sentimental attachment, giving Alex the property with the warehouse on it would be unfair and you could demand that if the court did grant a partition in kind that Alex must pay you an additional sum of money for being given a more valuable portion of the property. Overall, you have a few courses of action that you may act on. Please, let me know when you wish to proceed further investigating these options. 1b. Dear Carl, With regards to the gold coins, this is similar to another case Benjamin v. Lidner Aviation. There, the defendant found money wrapped up and placed in the wing of an airplane. The court ruled that becasue the nature the money was packaged and where it was placed, the property was likely mislaid and belonged to the owner of the airplance, the plaintiff, not the one who found it. Here the coins were wrapped in a bag and seemingly placed in a hidden spot within the last ten years where the original owner may have mislaid it. You may be able to argue, like the defendant in Benjamin that the coins were abandoned property and thus title belongs to the first finder. .however If the coins were consdiered mislaid property, then they would belong to the owner of the premises, Alex. Another case that is similar that Alex may bring up is Corliss v. Wenner. There, a worker found gold coins while working on another man's property and was forced to give them back to the owner. The court ruled that the gold coins were not subject to treasure trove finders law, which would have granted the finder title to the coins over anyone except for the true owner of the coins. The court instead ruled owner may have mislaid it. You may be able to argue, like the defendant in Benjamin that the coins were abandoned property and thus title belongs to the first finder. .however If the coins were consdiered mislaid property, then they would belong to the owner of the premises, Alex. Another case that is similar that Alex may bring up is Corliss v. Wenner. There, a worker found gold coins while working on another man's property and was forced to give them back to the owner. The court ruled that the gold coins were not subject to treasure trove finders law, which would have granted the finder title to the coins over anyone except for the true owner of the coins. The court instead ruled that the coins were ""embedded property"" and they classified as mislaid property and thus belonged to the owner of the premises, not the finder. Here, the coins were hidden in a small hole at the base of a warehouse wall and inside of a mesh bag. You may be able to argue a few things to get around the ruling of Corliss v. Wenner. Firstly, you may be able to argue that the coins were not ""embedded into the natural earth"" as was the case with Corliss and persuade the court that the coins are not embedded property, and are subject to treasure trove finders law, thus belonging to the first finder, you. The coins were in a shopping bag of a grocery store that opened only 10 years ago, which is unlike Corliss, where the coins could have been there for a number of years. If the coins were only left there 10 years ago then it is hard to make the argument the coins have been there for so long that they are ""embedded in the natural earth"" and may not be embedded property. If the coins are not embedded property, then you could argue that treasure trove finders law applies and the first finder, you has the right of ownership of the coins over the owner of the premises, Alex. Additionally, you may also be able to try to persuade the court that the coins are abandoned property and the right of ownership goes to the first finder. In conclusion, Alex has some strong arguments and cases to back up his claim, so it is unlikely you will be able to claim ownership over the coins, however you do have options for some counterarguments that may persuade the court. However, all of this discussion is void if the original owner of the coins comes to claim ownership of them, because the original owner's title is superior to any finder's title unless the property was abandoned. With regards to the issue of your Growler and Coat, you may be able to make a claim that Alex was a bailee of your goods and did not perform with a reasonable duty of care. In Allen v. Hyatt Regency Nashville, the plaintiff sued the defendant who operated a car park when the plaintiff's car was stolen from it. The court ruled that the defendant owed damages to the plaintiff because they entered a bailee, bailor relationship when the car was parked there and the defendant did not act with a reasonable duty of care to protect the car from being stolen. Here, with the case of your growler, you could argue that you entered into a bailee, bailor relationship because they gave you a ticket corresponding to your mug, giving you the reasonable presumption that they would watch over your mug for you with a reasonable bailee of your goods and did not perform with a reasonable duty of care.

The court ruled that the defendant owed damages to the plaintiff because they entered a bailee, bailor relationship when the car was parked there and the defendant did not act with a reasonable duty of care to protect the car from being stolen. Here, with the case of your growler, you could argue that you entered into a bailee, bailor relationship because they gave you a ticket corresponding to your mug, giving you the reasonable presumption that they would watch over your mug for you with a reasonable duty of care to make sure nothing happened to it, much like how in Allen, the defendant had a reasonable assumption that the car park would take care of his care because they had gates and security guards patrolling. It would be harder to argue that you entered into a bailee, bailor relationship with alex and the brewery for you coat however, becuase you did not have a reasonable belief that the brewery would watch over it, perhaps if the brewery had a coat check and lost your coat, you could make a case that they did not have a reasonable duty of care in a bailment. However, Alex may counter your argument that they entered into a bailment relationship with you because it is up to the clients to use their own mug for drinking and they are not responsible to pay damages if something happens to it. Nevertheless, you have quite a strong claim against Alex and the brewery for damages due to their lack of reasonable care with regards to your growler. 1c. Dear Alex, Firstly, because Brock conveyed his interest in the property back to Alex, Alex owns the 10 acres in fee simple, and thus is able to sell his title to others in fee simple and divide up the land as he sees fit without Brock's permission. You gave David Developer a present possessory interest in fee simple subject to executory limitation and your sons Frank and Fred have an executory interest in fee simple. As a result, if David Developer violated the terms of the deed and starts to build any commercial lot, the title will shift automatically to your sons Frank and Fred, who will then have present possessory interest in fee simple. The executory interest will cut short David's interest in the land and leave him with no title. Edward elixer has a present possessory interest in fee simple subject to condition subsequent and you, Alex, have a right of entry. You use the words ""so long as"" in your conveyance, which would indicate a fee simple determinable, however, you added words of limitation ""but if"" which indicate a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. In cases like this where the language is ambigious, the court usually prefers to give the grantee a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. If Edward ever decides interest will cut short David's interest in the land and leave him with no title. Edward elixer has a present possessory interest in fee simple subject to condition subsequent and you, Alex, have a right of entry. You use the words ""so long as"" in your conveyance, which would indicate a fee simple determinable, however, you added words of limitation ""but if"" which indicate a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. In cases like this where the language is ambigious, the court usually prefers to give the grantee a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. If Edward ever decides to start brewing IPAs, then you will have the right of entry to enter the property and forcibly take back the title to the property yourself, giving yourself back the title of the 5 acres and warehouse. However, if you do not take action and take back the title of the land through right of entry, then Edward can continue brewing IPAs as long as he wants as the rightful owner of the property, until you excercise the right of entry. "," The issue here is who has the rightful title of ownership to Greenacre, Betty or Debbie? Because Andrew sold the property without Betty's permisison to Carl, Betty still had rightful ownership of Greenacre and Andrew transferred Carl a defective title. Debbie however, would likely argue that she owns the property through adverse posssession through a color of title claim. A color of title claim can be made when there has been a defective title transferred and the transferee believes in good faith that the deed was genuine, which it seems was the case with Carl's purchase. In order for an adverse The issue here is who has the rightful title of ownership to Greenacre, Betty or Debbie?

A color of title claim can be made when there has been a defective title transferred and the transferee believes in good faith that the deed was genuine, which it seems was the case with Carl's purchase. In order for an adverse possession claim to succeed in New Suffolk, the possessor must satisfy the 10 year statute of limitations and possess the land in a manner that is: (1) open and notorious, (2) actual, (3) continuous, (4) exclusive, and (5) hostile. Debbie satisfies the statute of limitations becasuse, as shown in the case Tieu v. Morgan, an adverse possessor is able to ""tack on"" the time of adverse possessor that their predeccessor accrued before they conveyed the title. In this case, Carl adversely possessed the land for eight years, which can be tacked on to the eight years that debbie adversely possessed the land, making a total of 16 years, which is past the 10 year statute of limitations Debbie likely does not satisfy the continuous element of adverse possession. For a possession to be continuous, the possessor must use the property as much and as often as a normal property owner would use it for a uninterrupted period of time. This is a problem for Debbie because after her father died, Debbie did not move onto Greenacre until 3 years after his death, causing a gap in the period of time that Greenacre was adversely possessed. However, Debbie could argue that because her father allowed friends to hunt and fish on the property that it was still in use during that 3 year period between Carl's death and Debbie moving into the cabin on Greenacre. Betty may also argue that carl only used the property for eight weeks of the year and thus his possession was not continuous. However, Debbie can rebut that argument by saying that other property owners may only use their property during specific season, like fishing seasons, and as long as one uses it continuously for those seasons the possession is sufficiently continuous. Debbie likely does satisfy the element of hostile and notorious. For a possession to be open and notorious, the possession must be easily discernible upon inspection of the land to reasonably put the true owner on notice of the possession. Both Debbie and Carl expanded and made larger the main cabin and if Betty ever went to inspect the property it is highly likely that she would have been put on notice regarding the adverse possession. Betty may be able to argue that becasue the cabin was only on a small portion of the 50 acres of land that it would not be possible for the true owner to be put on notice by just the cabin on two acres of land similar to the argument in Manillo v. Gorski where a set of stairs encroaching a few inches over the property line were not deemed ""open and notorious"" and required the notorious, the possession must be easily discernible upon inspection of the land to reasonably put the true owner on notice of the possession. Both Debbie and Carl expanded and made larger the main cabin and if Betty ever went to inspect the property it is highly likely that she would have been put on notice regarding the adverse possession. Betty may be able to argue that becasue the cabin was only on a small portion of the 50 acres of land that it would not be possible for the true owner to be put on notice by just the cabin on two acres of land similar to the argument in Manillo v. Gorski where a set of stairs encroaching a few inches over the property line were not deemed ""open and notorious"" and required the adverse possessor to give actual notice becasue the possession was not easily noticable upon inspection. Nevertheless, the cabin is the only significant structure on the land and much larger than a few inches, so Debbie likely satisfies the open and notorious element. Debbie may satisfy the actual element of adverse possession. For a possession to be actual, one must use the property as a true landowner would use a similar piece of property. Both Carl and Debbie built additions to the cabin on greenacre and used it for hunting and fishing, which is something other landowners of a similar property would do. However, Betty might be able to argue that unlike Carl, Betty did not make use of the entire property and only actually occupied the 2 acres with the cabin on it and thus Betty has a right to the rest of the 48 acres. Nevertheless, Debbie may argue that allowing others to hunt on the land would constitute actual use and if not, Debbie can prove that she had actual possession of the two acres of Greenacre with the Cabin on it. Debbie likely satisfies the exclusive element of adverse. For a possession to be exclusive, the possessor must be the only one to use the property and excercise the right to exclude or allow others to be on the property like a normal property owner. Carl and Debbie both had friends or neighbors come onto their land to hunt and fish, however, they always thad the permission of the landowner, which is the right of any actual landowner to do. Betty may argue however, that Debbie did not have exclusive use of the whole fifty acres, but only the two acres around the house which is the only place that she would exclude people from and require permission to enter. Betty makes a strong case, and it is likely that Debbie only has exclusive possession of the two acres around the cabin. Finally, Debbie satisifes the hostile element of adverse possession. For a possession to be hostile, the possessor must occupy the property without permisson of the true owner. Some states require a good or bad faith intention, however, the majority of states do not take into account mental state with the regard to adverse possession. Debbie likely does satisfy the hostile element becuase she thought she the permission of the owners. had a genunie title to Greenacre and occupied it without In conclusion, Debbie has a reasonable claim for adverse possession that might persuade the court Finally, Debbie satisifes the hostile element of adverse possession.

Debbie likely does satisfy the hostile element becuase she thought she had a genunie title to Greenacre and occupied it without the permission of the owners. In conclusion, Debbie has a reasonable claim for adverse possession that might persuade the court into allowing her to gain title to Greenacre, however Betty also has good arguments to deny her claim for adverse possession, especially her argument against continuous possession. If the court does find Debbie adversely possessed Greenacre, it will likely only be the two acres that she actually and exclusively possessed and the rest of the 48 acres would belong to Betty.

ddee1d35-ea9d-4e90-b6dd-4a9c5ff90aa0," The first of Oliver's children to retire has a contingent remainder in a life estate. Robert has a an vested remainder in a life estate. The grandchildren have a contingent remainder subject to a condition that they reach the age of 25. Victor has a vested remainder - interest is already granted to him as he has fulfilled the age requirement. Robert and Carla can be the validating lives when applying the Rules against perpetuities to find out if the interest will vest within a lifetime plus 21 years. In this case the contingent remainder that is the interest created in the first of oliver's children to retire is applicable to the rule against perpetuities. If we use Robert as a measuring life, we will know within Robert's lifetime if he does or does not retire and therefore, if the interest will vest or completely fail. Therefore, the rules against perpetuities is valid. The same can be said about Carla, she is currently working full time and is a child of Oliver. Therefore, we can use her as a measuring life and be able to tell that within her lifetime we will know if she retired or not and if Oliver's interest will vest in her. Therefore, the rules against perpetuities is valid. The rules against perpetuities also applies to the grandchildren because they are contingent remainders - there is a condition they must fulfill before the interest can vest: they reach the age of 25. Victor has already fulfilled the age requirement therefore his interest is vested, the rule against perpetuities does not count against vested remainders. If we use Vivian as a measuring life, we will know within her life time starting at her age of 17 years if she reaches 25 or not, it must happen within the time she's alive. We will know if she never makes it to 25 and the interest fails to be passed to her. Therefore, the rules against perpetuities is valid. 2) A) The issue between Brock and Alex are whether as tenants in common Brock is able to receive money from the developer trying to buy the brewery. The deed that was signed exclusively uses language showing it is a tenants in common. Tenants in common cannot be unilaterally severed and must come to an agreement if it is to be sold or the share is to be passed on. Tenants in common cannot be passed by will of survivorship either. Brock and Alex each own a fixed share of the actual brewery, but are allowed to use the entirety of the property. Brock can bring a claim in court against "," A) The issue between Brock and Alex are whether as tenants in common Brock is able to receive money from the developer trying to buy the brewery. The deed that was signed exclusively uses language showing it is a tenants in common. Tenants in common cannot be unilaterally severed and must come to an agreement if it is to be sold or the share is to be passed on. Tenants in common cannot be passed by will of survivorship either. Brock and Alex each own a fixed share of the actual brewery, but are allowed to use the entirety of the property. Brock can bring a claim in court against Alex and the court will see note that as tenants in common they must each agree to sever the agreement of being tenants in common. Just like in Delfino, the court can come to a resolution of applying a partition by sale or a partition by kind. A partition by sale is where the court divides the shares according to the share each of them financially have in the property. A partition by kind would be where the court will evenly split the property and give each of them equal share as compensation. The partition in kind is highly disfavored as it is a disadvantage to the property holders who perhaps had a bigger financial share in the property to begin with. In delfino, the court applied a partition by sale in order tofairly represent the shares of each person and give each tenant in common the share that belongs to them. I would say this is Brock's best chance at possibly being able to be given his share in the property and allowing to sell that to the developer in order to make money. In this instance, it can also be possible that if Brock brings Alex to court the may find a color of title, showing that the title is defective to begin with. It states that when the deed was signed, the only signature on it was that of Alex's and because this is a mutual agreement, there needs to be both signatures. A color of title is comprised as a defective instrument which can have essential information missing such as the total land are or the signatures of both parties. Seeing as though this deed mentions Brock as a tenant in common, his signature was essential in the making of this deed. The court may hold that because this signature was missing in the conveyance of the deed, Alex didn't have real ownership of the brewery and neither did Brock and may choose to sever the tenant in common in all aspects. B) The issue with Carl is what kind of property are the coins he found in the base of the warehouse wall and whether or not he can keep them. The gold coins he found could be considered mislaid property, lost property, abandoned property or teasure trove. In this case, it seems that Carl found the gold coins in the base of the warehouse wall which can be mistaken as treasure trove property. Treasure trove property is defined as coins or currency which seem to have been intentionally stored somewhere. However, treasure trove is not really considered as a type of property and the courts treat it as mislaid property. Similar to Corliss, the employees found 3gold coins in a glass jar the same way Carl found the gold coins in a shopping bag, and the employees considered themselves the owners of the property. The employess in that case applied the finders law to the gold coins found, where the finder has lost property, abandoned property or teasure trove. In this case, it seems that Carl found the gold coins in the base of the warehouse wall which can be mistaken as treasure trove property. Treasure trove property is defined as coins or currency which seem to have been intentionally stored somewhere. However, treasure trove is not really considered as a type of property and the courts treat it as mislaid property. Similar to Corliss, the employees found gold coins in a glass jar the same way Carl found the gold coins in a shopping bag, and the employees considered themselves the owners of the property. The employess in that case applied the finders law to the gold coins found, where the finder has superior title of the item against everyone except the true owner. In that case, the court held that the gold coins were treasure trove property but the Idaho court as well as courts in the US did not use that acknowledge treasure trove as it can potentially hurt the interests of the owner of the property and they applied the mislaid property rule. The court ruled that the items belonged to the owner of the property. Mislaid property was considered property where the owner intentionally puts something in a specific location and overlooks them at a period of time. Because this would be considered mislaid property, the case where the pocket book was left behind in the barbershop, the court ruled that the item belonged in possession of the owner of the property and not the finder. Just like in that case or in Corliss, the court will most likely hold that this is mislaid property that belongs to the owner of the property.Therfore, the court may grant ownership to the coins to the owner of the brewery. So, Carl will not be able to keep them. The issue with Carl's growler and the coat is whether he has ownership of these things if found or if perhaps the brewery is responsible for misplacing his items. At the moment when Carl received a claim ticket for the growler when he arrived at the bar, one can say a bailor/bailee relationship was formed. In such a relationship the bailee has a duty to care and be responsible for the items. As seen in the Hyatt case, the same relationship was created when the plaintiffs parked their car in a ticketed garage and upon entrance and exit they had a ticcket to show their claim. The court in that case held that a bailee/bailor relationship was formed and that the parking garage was held liable for the missing car. In the same way, this relationship was created when Carl gives them his growler, the bartender accepts it and gives him a receipt of the acceptance - the tag with the number attached for retrieval. If in fact, Carl gives them his claim ticket to retrieve his growler and the brewery cannot seem to find it, they may have to compensate Carl for what he has lost. The court may rule for Carl the same way they did in Hyatt and have the brewery be held liable. As far as the coat, it can be seen that this is lost property in the very instance. The item is no longer in the place where the owner left it and is nowhere to be found. Carl has ultimate However, because Carl says ""forget it"" when ownership rights, whoever finds it has secondary 4rights. he cannot find his coat, one may argue that at that point if the coat was left behind it is now abandoned property. As abandoned property, the finder has ultimate ownership rights against everyone even the claim ticket to retrieve his growler and the brewery cannot seem to find it, they may have to compensate Carl for what he has lost. The court may rule for Carl the same way they did in Hyatt and have the brewery be held liable. As far as the coat, it can be seen that this is lost property in the very instance. The item is no longer in the place where the owner left it and is nowhere to be found. Carl has ultimate ownership rights, whoever finds it has secondary rights. However, because Carl says ""forget it"" when he cannot find his coat, one may argue that at that point if the coat was left behind it is now abandoned property. As abandoned property, the finder has ultimate ownership rights against everyone even the true owner. C) The issue in this question is what interests do the parties, David and Edward have and what happens since they have violated the terms by which they were conveyed on. When Alex sells the 5 vacant acres to David, David has a fee simple subject to the condition that it is used for residential purposes. If they do not honor that, the interest automatically vests to the third parties being Frank and Fred which are Alex's sons. Alex conveys to Edward a fee simple determinable with a right of entry by Alex to re-enter and reclaim the premises. David violated his interest when he decided to build the ground floor commercial stores, at this point the interest no longer was served for residential purposes. Automatically, the interests vest in Alex's sons and David loses what he has. Edward also violates his interest when he begins to make IPA's, his interest had remained valid up until the point where he started to do so. The interest to Edward was granted on a condition for a specific period of time, the time being that he does not make IPA's. Alex's interest automatically vests the minute when Edward violates the condition. David and edward have no interests anymore to the property and the only ones who do are alex and his two sons. The court is likely to honor the deed conveyed to them. "," The issue in this question is whether the tenant by the entirety was properly severed by Andrew and Betty and whether or not Debbie and Chris are able to have ownership of it. Tenants by the entirety imply that the couple who is married owns 100% of the property. Tenants by the entirety must be comprised of the four unities, time, title, interest and possession. They each must be present at the time the title is conveyed, their names must be on the title, they each have the same interest in the property and each hold same possession of the property. None of these unities can be made without the other being aware and if they want to sell the property they both must be aware of it and agree to it. In this case, Andrew sold the property cash without Betty knowing -- this makes the sale invalid as Betty was not aware nor did she agree. Therefore at that point in time, Betty still owned the property. In addition, imply that the couple who is married owns 100% of the property. Tenants by the entirety must be comprised of the four unities, time, title, interest and possession. They each must be present at the time the title is conveyed, their names must be on the title, they each have the same interest in the property and each hold same possession of the property. None of these unities can be made without the other being aware and if they want to sell the property they both must be aware of it and agree to it. In this case, Andrew sold the property cash without Betty knowing -- this makes the sale invalid as Betty was not aware nor did she agree. Therefore at that point in time, Betty still owned the property. In addition, Andrew selling the land to Chris implies a color of title. A color of title is a defective instrument which lacks an essential component of a deed, such as the signatures of the owners. In this case, Andrew forged Betty's signature making it defective and fradulent. At the point where Chris dies and leaves greenacre to Debbie, she still does not own any real title to the land, but she believes she does. Debbie can make a claim for adverse possession if she satisfid the elements being open and notrious, hostile, actual, continous, and exclusive and if she meets the statuary period of 10 years. She has been living there full time starting from 2011. The element she has satisfied is the open and notorious as she is visible to others and acting as a true owner would, she is actual (doing all a true owner would), but she is neither exclusive nor hostile. The exclusivity is not present as she allows her neighbors to hunt on the other acres of the land and she not hostile because she is acting in good faith and she honestly believes she owns the home. In most jurisdictions at a minimum, the court will ask that the adverse possessor acts in a hostile manner, without the owners permission. Because her father left her the land and he had been on the land since 2001, Debbie may be able to tack on the years Chris lived there for and meet the statuary period of 10 years for adverse possession. At this point, she still does not meet the elements of adverse possession and if she is in a court which holds a majority jurisdiction for the ""hostile"" element she will not be granted the property and Betty will receive it. However, she may be lucky and receive adverse possession if she is in a minority court (Maine) where they do not look into the hostile or acting without the owner's permisison requirement. If Betty is found of being away from her property for more than 10 years and Debbie fulfills the elements of adverse possession and the statuary limit, even though Debbie has a color of title, they can grant the land to Debbie thru adverse possession. It notes Betty has been away from her property for a long period of time an dnot specifically how long. The element of adverse possession mentions it must be continous, therefore, not necessarily that the owner needs to be there all the time present but must come back every now and then. Adverse possession attempts to reward the person who is using the home as an actual owner would and not abandoning it for extreme lengths at a time. grant the land to Debbie thru adverse possession.

507cd305-fb76-4948-b6fb-419fc92c699c," Once Oliver dies, the grant will take effect. Currently, Oliver has a fee simple, Oliver's children have a contingent remainder, Robert would have a vested remainder in life estate, Victor would have a vested remainder in fee simple subject to open and subject to divestment, and Vivian and any other grandchildren would have an executory interest in fee simple. Connor, Carla, any other children Oliver has, Robert, Victor, and Vivian are all lives-in-being as long as they are all alive that the time when Oliver dies. We will know when Oliver's children die whether or not they have retired, so their interests are all valid under RAP. Robert is a life-in-being, so his life estate is valid under RAP because his life estate is only until he dies. Additionally, his vested remainder is not subject to RAP. Because Victor is alive and has already surpassed the age limit of 25, because he is 26. His vested remainder interest is valid under RAP. Vivian's interest is also valid under RAP, even though is not yet 25 and it is possible for her to die before she reaches the age of vesting, because she is a life in being. However, any other grandchildren's interest are void under RAP. For example, if Connor has a child, X, tomorrow, and then Connor, Carla, any other children Oliver has, Robert, Victor, and Vivian (aka all the lives in being) die the next day, X would still be Oliver's grandchild, but is not a life in being because they were not born at the time the the interest started, which would be when Oliver dies. They would also not turn 25 within 21 years of the demise of a life in being, even if they lived the entirity of the 21 years. This would therefore violate RAP and make that interest void. If X is born before Victor dies, then the Rule of Convenience would apply because X would be part of a gift in which a class party has already vested. But if X is born after Victor dies, the rule of convenience does not take effect. On the other hand, if everyone dies before Oliver, only Robert and Victor's interests are valid under RAP. Robert's interest is not part of RAP, so his interest cannot be touched. Robert is a life-in-being and has already satisfied what he needs to in order to take his interest, so his is valid. If this were the case, the language of the grant would be that Oliver has a fee simple, Robert has a vested remainder in life estate, and Victor has a vested remainder in fee simple. "," A) The issue is whether Brock can take any steps to make money from the developer for the brewery. This issue hinges upon what type of interest Brock and Alex share in the brewery. When Alex wrote the and has already satisfied what he needs to in order to take his interest, so his is valid. If this were the case, the language of the grant would be that Oliver has a fee simple, Robert has a vested remainder in life estate, and Victor has a vested remainder in fee simple. 2) A) The issue is whether Brock can take any steps to make money from the developer for the brewery. This issue hinges upon what type of interest Brock and Alex share in the brewery. When Alex wrote the deed to include Brock in the property, he wrote that they hold it jointly as tenants in common. This language is ambiguous because it is unclear if Alex meant that he and Brock are Joint Tenants or Tenants-in-Common. The courts prefer to not cause issues between parties and prefer tenants-in- common so that they can work it out amongst themselves. But, because of the word 'jointly', the argument could be made that Alex meant Joint Tenancy so he can be sure that if Brock dies before him, he would get the right of survivorship and could continue to use the property as he originally intended. In order for Alex and Brock to be joint tenants, they also have to satisfy the four unities. There is potentially an issue with fulfilling the four unitites if the jurisdiction requires a straw-man in order to create a joint tenancy, because Alex did not first convey the land to an uninterested third-party, who could then convey the land to Alex and Brock at the same. This would mean that Alex and Brock did not take possession at the same time, not were they were conveyed the interest on the same title. If the jurisdiction does not require a straw-man, Alex would be OK to argue that it is a joint tenancy. If they are joint tenants, then Brock could unilaterally sever his joint interest in the property by selling or conveying his interest to the developer. This would then make the developer and Alex tenants in common, each as essentially owning half the unidivided land. More than likely, the court would say that the interest created was a tenancy-in-common, because the language specifically states tenants in common and simply throws in the jointly verbage, but nothing regarding survivorship. This means that Brock could still simply convey or sell his common interest to the developer, as he could before. The only difference is that it would not effect Alex's interests. However, the developer would probably not go for being a tenant in common because they presumably want to develop all ten acres of the land. Even if they only develop the unused acreage, they would have to split the proceeds of whatever they make with Alex. They could not charge Alex rent unless they agree upon it beforehand or if Alex tells them they cannot be on the property and ousts them, as pointed out in the trailer park case. Therefore, their benefits of keeping Alex in would not outweigh their costs. Brock instead could file a partition action against Alex so the courts decide how to divide the interest. The courts may prefer a partition in kind, meaning that they simply partition off the land as two separate parcels for each party to have individually and have one of the parties pay an owlety to the other to want to develop all ten acres of the land. Even if they only develop the unused acreage, they would have to split the proceeds of whatever they make with Alex. They could not charge Alex rent unless they agree upon it beforehand or if Alex tells them they cannot be on the property and ousts them, as pointed out in the trailer park case. Therefore, their benefits of keeping Alex in would not outweigh their costs. Brock instead could file a partition action against Alex so the courts decide how to divide the interest. The courts may prefer a partition in kind, meaning that they simply partition off the land as two separate parcels for each party to have individually and have one of the parties pay an owlety to the other to cover the difference in acreage, as they did in the garbage business case. This might work because there is unused land available that could be sectioned off from the rest of the parcel that contains the warehouse and brewery, which is also presumably easily accessible. Alex is also emotionally and financially attached very much to the land he is using for his business venture, which would presumably be difficult to easily moved to a different location. However, the brewery has only been around for about four years and is not established in the community as it specifically being in that location. Brock could then take his partition given to him by the partition in kind and sell it to the developer. However, once again, the developer presumably wants all of the land and Brock may have to pay an owlety to Alex because the partition he would get would be undeveloped land and the partition Alex would get would have a budding business that can no longer expand. Additionally, the developer, while they may want all the land, may go for this because they would have a better chance of paying only market value for the property they could purchase from Brock, which would leave Brock with much less at the end of the day and the developer would save their money. Brock would want instead to push for a partition in sale, which would sell the entirety of the parcel and split the profits of such sale between the parties. This may benefit Brock more because the developer has already put in an offer well over property value, which could pursuade the court to go this route because it would be most convenient for them to simply accept the developer's offer, even though it is well over market value, and simply split the profits in half to each Alex and Brock. This is Brock's best chance of both being rid of the property and making as much profit as possible. B. Dear Mr. Cask, It is my understanding that there are three issues at stake, which I will address individually. First, you would like to know if you have any ownership interest in the gold coins you found at the brewery. There are a few potential concepts that come into play. First, I will need to determine if this jurisdiction recognizes a treasure trove concept of of finder's law. The coins may qualify under this concept because they are extremely old and valuable currency, and because it can be argued that the original owner is unascertainable. However, because the mesh bag is from a grocery store that is only about 10 years old, it will be nearly impossible to argue that the owner of the coins at the time they were placed It is my understanding that there are three issues at stake, which I will address individually. First, you would like to know if you have any ownership interest in the gold coins you found at the brewery. There are a few potential concepts that come into play. First, I will need to determine if this jurisdiction recognizes a treasure trove concept of of finder's law. The coins may qualify under this concept because they are extremely old and valuable currency, and because it can be argued that the original owner is unascertainable. However, because the mesh bag is from a grocery store that is only about 10 years old, it will be nearly impossible to argue that the owner of the coins at the time they were placed there would be dead or unascertainable. Because you found the coins in a mesh bag in a hole you had to squeeze your fingers into, the argument could be made that the owner meant to place them there and forgot where they put them, but was planning on coming back to search for and retrieve them. If that is the case, then you do not have ownership of the coins, as mislaid property belongs to the property owner of the location the mislaid property was found until the true owner comes back to collect them. However, because they were in a hole in the ground, the coins could have been lost, or abandoned. If the coins were lost, you as the finder would have rights over any other person besides the true owner of the coin. If the true owner is located or comes forward, you would have to give him the coins as the true owner of the property. If the coins were abandoned, that means the owner relinquished all rights to the coins, whether or not they were intentionally placed in the hole. This would make you the owner of the coins because you found the coins. Secondly, it is my understanding that your growler that was of significant sentimental value and could not be located by the brewery when you went to retrieve it. Because the brewery took the growler directly from you, and gave you a claim ticket, they have created a bailment with you over the possession of the growler. This means that while they had possession, they were responsible for the care of your growler and should have provided that growler back to you in the correct condition when you claim to retrieve it. This means that you can file an action against the brewery for that growler. Because the brewery told you that their employee broke the growler, an action for replevin would not make sense, as the growler is broken and presumably thrown away. The brewery may attempt to argue that they did not create a bailment with you for this growler because it was not placed in a secure location nor was someone watching it the entire time it was under their care. However, this would probably not prevail, as Allen v Hyatt points out that the claim ticket and them taking the growler from you should be sufficient. Though that case involves a vehicle in a parking garage, that garage was an enclosed building that the property owner had to get a claim ticket to park his vehicle there and it had an to you leaving your growler with the bartender attendant at least part of the time. This would analagous and getting a claim ticket and the bartender placing your growler in a secure place. The brewery is liable for the lost growler because they were responsible for it via bailment. location nor was someone watching it the entire time it was under their care.

This would analagous to you leaving your growler with the bartender and getting a claim ticket and the bartender placing your growler in a secure place. The brewery is liable for the lost growler because they were responsible for it via bailment. Lastly, you are concerned about the coat you left at the brewery. Initially, that coat was mislaid by you because you placed in on a hook and simply could not find it. This would mean that the brewery should still have possession of it until you go back to claim it. However, because you decided to leave without your coat and figured you would just 'forget it', you at that point abandoned your coat and therefore relinquished all the rights to the coat. This means that whoever finds the coat is now the owner and you have no way of recovering it. If you would like to argue that your excited utterance was mostly in exasperation and not actually meant to mean you abandoned the coat, you can attempt to do so. However, the courts will probably not take your state of mind into account and still deem that you abandoned the coat at that moment. C. Alex conveyed a fee simple subject to executory interest to his sons, Frank and Fred as tenants in common. However, the sons' interests are void under RAP. This is because it is possible for the property to be used as residental purposes for more than 21 years after Alex, Frank and Fred all die. Alex, Frank and Fred are all lives in being, so when they die, the condition would have to be met within 21 years for it to be valid. Because the majority of jurisdictions do not recognize the wait-and-see approach, it does not matter that the condition was already at issue. The sons would not get the property in this manner. Therefore, David probably has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because David had planned to use the the property for residental purposes when it is conveyed to him. The language is simliar to that of the ambiguous language of Marenholz. If the courts agree that it is fee simple subject to condition subsequent, Alex has the right of entry onto this property. Because Alex is the original grantor, his rights are not subject to RAP. Alex would have to enter the property in order to regain ownership. Once he has done so, he is allowed to do whatever he pleases with the property, including conveying the property to his sons, Frank and Fred. The end result would be the same but he would just have to go about it in a different manner than his original conveyance attempted to do. If the courts determine that the ambiguous language instead gave David a fee simple determinable, because David had not yet made the property for residential purposes and it was not being used for residental purposes when it was conveyed, Alex would have the possibility of reverter. If that is the case, Alex the original grantor, his rights are not subject to RAP. Alex would have to enter the property in order to regain ownership. Once he has done so, he is allowed to do whatever he pleases with the property, including conveying the property to his sons, Frank and Fred. The end result would be the same but he would just have to go about it in a different manner than his original conveyance attempted to do. If the courts determine that the ambiguous language instead gave David a fee simple determinable, because David had not yet made the property for residential purposes and it was not being used for residental purposes when it was conveyed, Alex would have the possibility of reverter. If that is the case, Alex already has ownership of the property and once again can convey the land to his sons if he wants the same end result. Alex convey the land to Edward in fee simple subject to condition subsequent even though the language is ambiguous because he specifically stated that he would have the right of re-entry onto the premises. This interest does not fall under RAP, so the timing of the condition does not matter. Additionally, because the brewery was already not making IPAs, it would take the new condition of making IPAs to trigger his right of re-entry. Alex can enter and retake the property, but must do so as soon as possible if he wants to actually fulfill this right. Edward may argue that because Alex knew he was making IPAs and did not re-enter the property to take it, he has waived his right to do so because Alex continued to allow Edward to possess the property despite the condition being of issue. Alex could also argue that he meant to make a fee simple determinable, which would mean that the property automatically reverted back to him and he did not need to re-enter. This however would not work because IPAs were already being made on the property. "," This issue is who has actual rights to the property. Andrew and Betty owned the property as tenants in the entirety. This means that there is a right of survivorship. This also means that neither party can convey the property without the others consent while they are both still married. It does not matter that they lived separately or were not honest with one another because they never legally divorced. When Andrew sold the property to Chris in 2001, Chris acquired the land by color of title becuase he forged Betty's signature. - Andrew died in 2004, Betty acquired land via right of survivorship. - Continued to be used in the same manner during7this time, but Betty never visited - Chris died in 2009, still color of title when left in fee simple to Debbie, land still potentially used in Betty's signature. - Andrew died in 2004, Betty acquired land via right of survivorship. - Continued to be used in the same manner during this time, but Betty never visited - Chris died in 2009, still color of title when left in fee simple to Debbie, land still potentially used in customary manner - 2011, Debbie moves to Greenacre, enters and takes actual possession, improves the land - Debbie stays on her 2 acres, continues to improve land she is using, does not allow people on it without permission - 2019, Betty comes to property, sees Debbie on porch- should have visited sooner! - Debbie can adversely possess via color of title her two acres, but Betty still has the other 48 acres because Debbie wasn't using them - Debbie may argue title says all 50 and she should get all of them, but this is not the case -AP- needs to meet statute of limitations (presumed 21 years), open and notorious, hostile, exclusive, actual entry, continuous use -Debbie- open and notorious, yes, lived on and improved land - Hostile- color of title - actual entry- yes, lived there -continuous- issue- did not take possession or use customarily for 2 years, SoL may start over in 2011 - exclusive- only as to the 2 acres, allowed others on it, BUT it was customary to allow others on it to hunt, so may be OK - Betty may have waste claim because Debbie changed the land. Depends on if jurisdiction is OK with amerilotive waste - could be like Marengo Cave - Betty may have waste claim because Debbie changed the land. Depends on if jurisdiction is OK with amerilotive waste - could be like Marengo Cave ",440,2734,426
c6b6baea-3f79-4d14-bc22-83d685e04cfb," Rap only applies to executory interests, contingent remainders, and vested remainders subject to open. RAP has three elements, vesting: where the interest vests, creation of the grant: as through inter vivos a deed or by will, and a life in being: where at the time of the grant, all people alive at the time of the grant can be used as validating lives and all interests must vest or be known to vest within 21 years of the last validing life's death. O has fee simple subject to executory limitation Connor and Carla = executory interest for life (in a life estate) = Valid because both of them are life in beings at the time of the conveyance so they can be their own validating lives. Within the death of all of them we will know if the interest vests or not depending on if one of them retired or not. Robert = vested remainder for life (in a life estate) = RAP does not apply to all vested remainders, only vested remainders subject to open. Victor and Vivian = vested remainder subject to open = VOID because there is a scenario where Connor or Carla have a child let's say X (that would be Oliver's grandchild). The next day, Oliver, Connor, Carla, Victor, and Vivian all die leaving only X alive. Furthermore, becacuse X was not alive at the time of the conveyance, X cannot be their own validating life. Therefore after the death of everyone else that were alive at the time of the conveyance, X's interest can vest because they turn 25, vesting the interest, 21 years after the death of a life in being which would violate the Rule against Perpetuities becacuse the interest could vest after 21 years. However in a jurisdiction where the Rule of Convenience applies, the court would take the invalid interest (Victor and Vivian's vested remainder subject to open) and close the class because there was a 11 the condition needed to vest (Victor because he met life in being at the time of the grant that had already had already reached the age of 25, as he is 26). Thus, a court applying the Rule of Convenience would close the class and say that at the time of the grant, only Victor and the children alive at the time of the becacuse the interest could vest after 21 years. However in a jurisdiction where the Rule of Convenience applies, the court would take the invalid interest (Victor and Vivian's vested remainder subject to open) and close the class because there was a life in being at the time of the grant that had already met the condition needed to vest (Victor because he had already reached the age of 25, as he is 26). Thus, a court applying the Rule of Convenience would close the class and say that at the time of the grant, only Victor and the children alive at the time of the grant can be a part of that class and any other grandchildren born after they close it would be unable to join the class after the court closes it. In a jurisdiction where the Rule of Convenience is not applied though, the Rule against Perpetuities would strike out the invalid interests and thus the grant would read: ""to the first of my children to retire, for life, then to my nephew Robert for life, followed by a reversion to me (Oliver) or my (Oliver's) estate in fee simple."" The reversion is added to the end of the conveyance because the two other interests that were given were only life estates and so the whole interest was not given out and something would have to happen after the final estate, thus the reversion is added because courts have a preference to give up all of the estate in an effort to follow the grantor's interests and to avoid partial intestacy. Partial intestacy occurs when there all interests are not given (usually by lack of a will) and would then follow the governing rules of intestate of the appropriate jurisdiction. "," 1A. Brock trying to make money The main issue is what would happen when Brock orders a partition, which Brock would argue for a partition in sale. The rule generally as seen through Delfino is that partition in kinds (physically dividing up the land) are preferred by courts although in practice, partition in sales are usually what courts order. Like in Delfino, Alex will argue that he is similar to Vealenci (the woman with the garbage business) as he is ""invested in the enterprise"" and it had been his ""dream to make beer and he is finally succeeding in 1A. Brock trying to make money The main issue is what would happen when Brock orders a partition, which Brock would argue for a partition in sale. The rule generally as seen through Delfino is that partition in kinds (physically dividing up the land) are preferred by courts although in practice, partition in sales are usually what courts order. Like in Delfino, Alex will argue that he is similar to Vealenci (the woman with the garbage business) as he is ""invested in the enterprise"" and it had been his ""dream to make beer and he is finally succeeding in that effort"" with his brewery business. Thus the court would have to weigh the elements of partition in sale that need to show the physical attributes of the land make it hard for a partition in kind to occur, the sale would benefit all owners, and that the sale would not be prejudicial to any one owner. Here, the court would look at the prejudice the sale would do to Alex as his whole brewery dream is located on the warehouse and the fact that it is hard to divide the land up physically because most likely the court would give Alex the section with the brewery but then the other half would be hard to equalize in value to give to Brock. The second element would be met however as both parties would benefit from the sales as the developer offered ""over $2 million for the property."" Furthermore, Brock would argue that Alex would gain money from the sale because the developer is ""willing to pay far more than the property is worth and that it would be enough for Alex to buy land not too far away and to move the brewery there, plus [Alex] would have a good chunk of money left over."" As courts prefer partition in kind and because Alex has such an interest in the property like the scenario in Delfino the court would most likely order a partition in kind to allow Alex to keep his brewery business. Afterwards, Brock could offer his half of the property to the developer to make money. If a court found that the elements of a partition in sale were met in this case however, then Brock would be able to sell the property to the developer to make money. If Brock wanted to make money not just from the developer, it becomes a question of as cotenants, can Brock require rent from other cotenants, in this case Alex. As seen in Martin, the rule is no cotenants cannot require rent unless they were ousted or there was an agreement to pay. Here Brock can argue that he was ousted as Alex told Brock ""get out of here and don't come back"" indicating a sign that Alex wanted and will exercise exclusive use of the property and would not allow Brock back onto the property. Now, Brock would likely be able to require Alex to pay him for rent as he has been living on the property rent free. that he was ousted as Alex told Brock ""get out of here and don't come back"" indicating a sign that Alex wanted and will exercise exclusive use of the property and would not allow Brock back onto the property. Now, Brock would likely be able to require Alex to pay him for rent as he has been living on the property rent free. 3) 1B. Carl keeping gold coins, growler, coat Gold Coins: The issue is who has a superior claim to the gold coins, Carl or Alex and Brock the land owners. There are many rules that can be applied to these gold coins and one of those rules is the classification of coins and currency to be either treasure trove or embedded. In Corliss, a court defined multiple categories of found property and among them were mislaid, treasure trove, and embedded. Mislaid property is property an owner unintentionally leaves and forgets or overlooks where the property is afterwards. The rule concerning mislaid property is that the true owner has a superior claim over anyone else. But if the owner cannot be found, then the property would go to the land owner in hopes that the owner will come back and look for it. Both categories, treasure trove and embedded, concern coins and currency the original owner leaves concealed somewhere. The major difference is that when the owner cannot be found, coins or currency classified as treasure trove goes to the finder whereas coins or curency classified as embedded go to the property owner. Courts will likely prefer embedded to avoid people from going onto other's property and digging for coins and currency, only to be able to claim it over it. In a court that follows Corliss where the court in Corliss rejected the category of treasure trove and the coins in that case were considered mislaid and given to the property owner, the property owners Alex and Brock would have the superior claim to the coins. Alex and Brock can also mention Lindner Aviation that involved money in the wall of the airplane also considered mislaid that was given to the property owner to further support their claim. In a court where the mislaid category applies, then the local grocery store could argue that they have a superior claim to the coins over anyone because they can argue that they are the original owners as it was placed in a mesh shopping bag with their name on it. However Alex and Brock can argue that the true owner of the coins merely bought something from the local grocery store and placed the coins in the shopping bag and hid them and so the coins should be considered mislaid or embedded and would go to them, the landowners. Alex and Brock also have a Aviation that involved money in the wall of the airplane also considered mislaid that was given to the property owner to further support their claim. In a court where the mislaid category applies, then the local grocery store could argue that they have a superior claim to the coins over anyone because they can argue that they are the original owners as it was placed in a mesh shopping bag with their name on it. However Alex and Brock can argue that the true owner of the coins merely bought something from the local grocery store and placed the coins in the shopping bag and hid them and so the coins should be considered mislaid or embedded and would go to them, the landowners. Alex and Brock also have a superior claim in a court that accepts the embedded category because the coins would go to the property owner. Carl's best legal claim to the gold coins would be if the court accepts a treasure trove category to find that the coins would go to Carl, the finder of the coins. Carl can also argue under the rule of Armory that says finders have superior claim to found property over everyone but previous possessors and the original owner. Growler: Carl has a strong legal claim against the bartender under the impression that a bailor / bailee relationship was created. A bailor / bailee relationship is creaated when the bailor (the true owner) gives the bailee (the receipient) their property without transfer of title. There is an underlying reasonable duty of care of the bailee to hang onto and protect the property that the bailor left with them. Through an employer / employee relationship, Carl could go after Alex and Brock as the employer of the employee who acted as the bailee to recover from the damages he incurred in leaving the growler with them and the resulting damages that occurred when the growler was destroyed. The rule in this case comes from the Hyatt- Regency Hotel case where a similar situation was considered and the court found that a bailor / bailee relationship was created as there was a claim ticket given to the property in question and Carl was given a claim ticket just like the car owner in the Hyatt case. Dissimilar to the Hyatt case however, is the fact that Carl gave up full control of the growler and the bailee then took full contro over the growler which makes the argument that a bailor / bailee relationship was created even stronger because in the dissent of the Hyatt case, it was argued that the hotel (bailee) in that case never took full control over the property (car) as the car owner (bailor) kept the car keys. Coat: Carl does not have a strong claim against Alex and Brock as the way he left his coat was on one of the hooks by the front door. However this likely does6 not create a bailor / bailee relationship because although full control is given up, there is no claim ticket to show evidence that Carl gave up full possession of the coat to someone. Also, it is common practice that coats and jackets are left on hooks (car) as the car owner (bailor) kept the car keys. Coat: Carl does not have a strong claim against Alex and Brock as the way he left his coat was on one of the hooks by the front door. However this likely does not create a bailor / bailee relationship because although full control is given up, there is no claim ticket to show evidence that Carl gave up full possession of the coat to someone. Also, it is common practice that coats and jackets are left on hooks and Carl would have to go after the person who stole his coat, although it would be hard to track that person down. 1C. Alex's interests against David and Edward David - David has a fee simple subject to executory limitation because although there are words of condition that indicate a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the fact that the property would go to a third party, Alex's sons, makes it a fee simple subject to executory limitation and Alex's sons would have an executory interest. Alex has no legal claims against David because David ""plans to build a development with a mixture of residential units and ground floor commercial stores."" However, David has not actually built any of the commercial stores yet so he has no claim. Once the commercial stores are built, Alex will still not have a claim against David because he longer has interests as only his sons Frank and Fred have executory interests in the property. Only Frank and Fred have legal claims to the property. Edward - Edward has a Fee simple subject to condition subsequent because of the words of condition ""so long as the premises are never used to make IPAs."" Alex has a right of re-entry because a right of re-entry follows a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and the deed says ""Alex has the right to re-enter and reclaim the premises."" However because Edward only ""decides to start making IPAs on the property"" this means he has not actually done so yet. Therefore, Alex has no legal claims against Edward UNTIL an IPA is actually made on the premises because of the strict language of the deed. But Edward - Edward has a Fee simple subject to condition subsequent because of the words of condition ""so long as the premises are never used to make IPAs."" Alex has a right of re-entry because a right of re-entry follows a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and the deed says ""Alex has the right to re-enter and reclaim the premises."" However because Edward only ""decides to start making IPAs on the property"" this means he has not actually done so yet. Therefore, Alex has no legal claims against Edward UNTIL an IPA is actually made on the premises because of the strict language of the deed. But once an IPA is made on the premises, then Alex will have a valid legal claim to the property as he will be able to exercise his right of re-entry to take back the premises because he is the grantor. A case that Alex can mention is Mahrenholz which showed that courts prefer fee simple subject to condition subsequent over fee simple determinable, which is followed by a possibility of reverter, because courts want to avoid property owners from having their land being taken away from them automatically. This is because within a fee simple determinable, a possibility of reverter applies automatically and grants the grantor the property back without the grantor needing to do anything. On the other hand, a fee simple subject to condition subsequent is followed by a right of re-entry which DOES NOT apply automatically and requires the owner to take action to take back or reclaim the property. "," Betty and Debbie's Legal Claim to Greenacre The issue is who has a superior claim to the property of Greenacre, Betty or Debbie. Betty: Betty would argue that she had a tenancy by the entirety with her husband Andrew that includes the 4 unities of time, title, interest, and possession and a Right of Survivorship. Assuming that the tenancy by the entirety that was made was valid because it was conveyed where both Andrew and Betty received the interest at the same time, under the same document or instrument, with the same equal undivided interest in the property, each have access to the whole possession of the property, and both were married to each other (spouses to each other), then the rule is that individuals CANNOT unilaterally to convey interests away from the tenancy by sever their interests and there needs to be mutual 8consent the entirety. Thus, Betty's legal claim would be that Andrew selling Greenacre to Chris was invalid because it lacked mutual consent as seen by Andrew ""not wanting to deal with Betty, and [Andrew the entirety that was made was valid because it was conveyed where both Andrew and Betty received the interest at the same time, under the same document or instrument, with the same equal undivided interest in the property, each have access to the whole possession of the property, and both were married to each other (spouses to each other), then the rule is that individuals CANNOT unilaterally sever their interests and there needs to be mutual consent to convey interests away from the tenancy by the entirety. Thus, Betty's legal claim would be that Andrew selling Greenacre to Chris was invalid because it lacked mutual consent as seen by Andrew ""not wanting to deal with Betty, and [Andrew forging Betty's] name on the deed"" and Andrew was not able to as tenants under the tenancy by the entirety cannot unilaterally sever their interests. Thus the deed to Chris is invalid when Andrew died, Greenacre went to Betty through the Right of Survivorship that says the surviving tenant will receive all of the interests in the property and the deceased tenant's interests disappear completely. Debbie: Debbie's legal claim to the title under her getting Greenacre under Chris's will would not be valid as the tenancy by the entirety of Andrew and Betty was never severed. However, her proposed legal claim to Greenacre comes from a different issue. Whether or not Debbie can claim Greenacre through adverse possession (AP). The elements of AP are laid out and explained well in Pimental, a MA case that goes over all the required elements of AP. First of all the statute of limitations time period is not met because the statute states the time necessary is 10 years and Debbie occupied the property from 2011 when she ""moved there to live full-time in 2011"" until the present day 2019 which is 8 years. However the rest of her argument for AP would be going through each of the elements of: Continuous - Debbie was constantly on the property as a true owner would (within the reasonableness of the area and how property is treated there) and she ""never ventured beyond the acres of her house"". Hostile / adverse - Debbie has to occupy the premise without permission of the owner and she can show that she did not have permission from Betty because Betyt never gave it to her. In jurisdictions that follow Good faith likeTieu, an Oregon Case the possessor needs an honest, but mistaken belief that the property is theirs. Debbie would satisfy this as she Bad faith - Dombkowski ME Case - need to know it is someone else's property and still try to adversely possess. Debbie would fail this because 11did not know it was Betty's property. she Objective (Morrow) RI case - need to believe they have a stronger claim to the title. Debbie would In jurisdictions that follow Good faith likeTieu, an Oregon Case the possessor needs an honest, but mistaken belief that the property is theirs. Debbie would satisfy this as she Bad faith - Dombkowski ME Case - need to know it is someone else's property and still try to adversely possess. Debbie would fail this because she did not know it was Betty's property. Objective (Morrow) RI case - need to believe they have a stronger claim to the title. Debbie would pass this because she genuinely believed she received Greenacre under her father's will without knowing that her father actually did not receive the interest because the deed was faulty. Actual - the elmenet of physically being there which she can show by her moving to the area and never venturing from her house. Notorious / Open - acting so the owner is able to be put on notice that the AP is there and acting - Debbie would be able to show this as she built a ""big year-round house"" on the property Marengo Cave - Debbie's case is unlike Marengo because Debbie actually was above ground and doing all those things to put Betty on notice.

b4b58e7e-2a41-4e45-aca3-7b69511f3866," Before RAP, O owns the estate in fee simple subject to executory limitation because it may be divested/cut short by his children's future interest. Connor and Carla both have springing executory interests in life estate because they are grantees and whichever retires first will divest O's estate. Whoever retires first will take possession of a life estate.The other children will get nothing. (O's other children have a contingent remainder in life estate because they are unborn/unascertained). O's unborn children have a contingent remainder in life estate. Robert has a vested remainder in life estate because he is ascertained and his interest is not subject to a condition precedent but rather will become possessory upon the natural termination of the prior estate. Victor and Vivian have a vested remainder subject to partial divestment in fee simple. Other grandchildren may be born and join the class. RAP The RAP states that no interest is valid unless it must vest or fail within 21 years of a life in being. It applies to contignent remainders; vested remainders subject to partial divestment; and executory interests.It does not apply to possessory life estates. A class gift vests when all members of the class are ascertained. However, the Rule of Convenience states that if a member of the class meets the contingencies of the gift at the time of the grant, the class may close for that member and other members alive at the time of the grant. Potential members born after the grant are out of luck. For this problem, Oliver, Robert, Connor, Carla, Victor, and Vivian are all lives in being, and may be validating lives. The executory interest in Connor and Carla, and the contingent remainder in life estate in the first of O's children to retire, is void under RAP because it is possible that O has an afterborn child X. Then, all are ascertained. However, the Rule of Convenience states that if a member of the class meets the contingencies of the gift at the time of the grant, the class may close for that member and other members alive at the time of the grant. Potential members born after the grant are out of luck. For this problem, Oliver, Robert, Connor, Carla, Victor, and Vivian are all lives in being, and may be validating lives. The executory interest in Connor and Carla, and the contingent remainder in life estate in the first of O's children to retire, is void under RAP because it is possible that O has an afterborn child X. Then, all lives in being die before either Connor or Carla retired. X might retire 60 years later (making him the first of O's children to retire) and only then would his executory interest vest (i.e. become posessory). Thus, it would vest past a life in being plus 21 years. It is void under RAP. RAP does not apply to Robert's vested remainder, and in any event even if it did he would be his own validating life since he was alive at the time of the grant. The vested remainder subject to partial divestment in Victor and Vivian is saved by the Rule of Convenience, as explained above. Since the class gift goes to O's grandchilren who reach 25, and Victor is alive and meets the contingency at the time of the grant, the class closes for Victor for purposes of RAP. Similarly, because Vivian is alive and Victor meets the condition, the class closes with Vivian in it. No other grandchildren of O can join the class, and it is vested under RAP. Therefore, it is valid. After RAP Considering the effect of RAP, the grant conveys the following interests: Robert has a possessory life estate; Victor has a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple (only Vivian may partially divest Victor's estate); Vivian has a contingent remainder in fee simple. "," 1a. Nature of Brock's property interest and possibilites available to him Dear Brock: Ambiguous grant The first issue to address is what interest you have in the wharehouse and ten acres of land where the deed conveying your interest states the land is to be held ""jointly as tenants in common"" with your brother Alex. The language of the grant is ambiguous because it uses language from two distinct types of co-ownership estates. The language ""jointly"" implies a joint tenancy, which has a right of survivorship (meaning upon one tenant's death his interest passes to the other tenant automatically) and must be created using specific language, in addition to satsifying the four unities of time, title, possession, and interest. The language ""as tenants in common"" indicates a tenancy in common, which does not have a right of survivorship. When language is ambiguous as it is here courts prefer to recognize a tenancy in common. Further, a JT really must use language indicating an intent to convey a right of survivorship, and there is no such language in your deed. As a co-tenant with your brother, you have certain rights and duties. You each possess a 1/2 interest in the property, but you each have a right to possess, use, and exclude third parties from the whole of the property. Your fractional interest applies to finances. For instance, you are each responsible for 1/ the carrying charges (mortgage and taxes and certain necessary repairs), and you are each entitled to 1/ the proceeds/profits of renting out the property or other uses of the property that make money. Absent an agreement or ouster, you may not demand rent from a co-tenant. Martin v. Martin. Here, it appears Alex may have ousted you because he said, ""get out of here and don't come back!"" You might argue that Alex has prevented you from using the property and he is now using it only for himself, and thus you may seek rent. However, a court typically requires ouster to include a request by the putative ousted tenant to return to the property, and a rejection of entry by the tenant in possession. Alex might argue that he only made the remark in a heat, that he has not actually prevented you from entering the property. A court would likely find there is no ouster here because you have not requested entry and been denied. Further, there is no indication Alex has changed locks preventing you from entering the wharehouse, which might support an ouster finding. Partition ousted tenant to return to the property, and a rejection of entry by the tenant in possession. Alex might argue that he only made the remark in a heat, that he has not actually prevented you from entering the property. A court would likely find there is no ouster here because you have not requested entry and been denied. Further, there is no indication Alex has changed locks preventing you from entering the wharehouse, which might support an ouster finding. Partition Next, since you want to make money on the property and a developer has approached you with a tentative offer, we should discuss what possibilites are available to you to make money where your brother clearly does not want to sell. If you cannot come to an agreement with Alex, your options are to seek a court ordered partition. A partition in kind is a physical division of land, in which the court awards each tenant a parcel of the land whose value is equivalent to the tenant's interest. Courts prefer a partition in kind beacuse it allows tenants to stay on the land, rather than forcing them off. Delfino v. Vealencis. A partition by sale, by contrast, is a forced sale of the land, in which the proceeds of the sale are awarded to the tenants according to their interest. A court will only order a partition by sale if two conditions are met: (1) a partition in kind is physically impracticable because of unique attributes of the land that make it difficult to divide physically according to each tenant's interest (or because there are so many tenants that each would only receive a very tiny parcel of land); and (2) a partition by sale will better promote the interests of all tenants. Delfino. Courts typically consider interests to mean financial interests but, as in Delfino, courts will also look to tenants' personality interests in the land, such as if a tenant has made it her home or has a strong emotional attachment to the land. In reality, courts award partition by sale more frequently because it is administratively simpler. Here, you should seek a partition by sale to maximize the proceeds since the developer will pay $2 million for the whole property and it will be worth more if sold in whole. You should argue that it will be impractible to physical divide the land according to your 1/2 interests because the court has no reasonable way to determine the relative value of parcels of the ten acre property. For instance, the property has a wharehouse, a tasting room, and a restaurant, and 10 acres of open land. It would be near impossible for a court to determine the relative value of the various parcels of the property and split it up according to your interest. (Alex will argue that a partition in kind is not impracticable; he will argue that he should keep the wharehouse because he has an emotional attachment to it and it is his business that he himself started; and there are only two interests to divide it between.) Further, you should argue that a partition by sale will better promote each parties' financial interest. The proeprty is worth more to the developer as a whole, and since Alex paid $500k for the land originally, $1 million will be more than enough for Alex to purchase a brand new property nearby to continue his business. Alex will argue that near impossible for a court to determine the relative value of the various parcels of the property and split it up according to your interest. (Alex will argue that a partition in kind is not impracticable; he will argue that he should keep the wharehouse because he has an emotional attachment to it and it is his business that he himself started; and there are only two interests to divide it between.) Further, you should argue that a partition by sale will better promote each parties' financial interest. The proeprty is worth more to the developer as a whole, and since Alex paid $500k for the land originally, $1 million will be more than enough for Alex to purchase a brand new property nearby to continue his business. Alex will argue that property values around the brewery have increased as a result of development; and thus $1m might not get him a comparable site. Further, he will argue he has a personality interest in the property since it is where he started his first business, which he had been wanting to do for years. A court will likely find that Alex's personality interest is not as strong as in Delfino, where the tenant seeking partition in kind had lived on teh land for decades and it was passed on from her family. Further, here the property is only a commerical property, not a residence. The attachment is not as strong. Thus, for these reasons it is likely a court would award a partition by sale, in which case you would get $1 million. 1b. Finders law: Carl's legal rights w/r/t the gold coins, his growler, and his coat; competing interests and counters Dear Carl: You raise two issues: whether you get title to the coins under finders law (Amory; McAvoy; Corliss; Benjamin); and whether you entered into a bailment relationship with the brewery such taht you can bring an action against it for the loss of your coat and destruction of your growler. Hyatt Regency. First, how to categorize the valuable late-1800s gold coins you found in the wall wrapped in mesh bag. There are four categories of found property: lost, abandoned, mislaid, and treasure trove/embedded. The default is a finder acquires title to property good against all but the true owner. However, in categorizing the properyt courts look to the honesty of the finder. Title to found property is relative. Here, the main categories relevant are lost and mislaid. Lost property is prop that an owner unintentionally and involuntarily parts with and does not know where it is; the finder gets title good against all but the true owner. Amory. Mislaid property is property that is placed someplace voluntarily and intentionally by the owner, who then forgets where it is. McAvoy. Such prop is awarded to the owner of the premises (good against all but the true owner), on the theory that he/she can better protect the prop if the owner comes back looking for it. Here, the gold coins have characteristics of mislaid property -- they were carefully wrapped, as the gold coins were in Corliss (where the court awarded possession to the landowner), and seemed to be placed in a small hole in the bottom of the wall. it unintentionally and involuntarily parts with and does not know where it is; the finder gets title good against all but the true owner. Amory. Mislaid property is property that is placed someplace voluntarily and intentionally by the owner, who then forgets where it is. McAvoy. Such prop is awarded to the owner of the premises (good against all but the true owner), on the theory that he/she can better protect the prop if the owner comes back looking for it. Here, the gold coins have characteristics of mislaid property -- they were carefully wrapped, as the gold coins were in Corliss (where the court awarded possession to the landowner), and seemed to be placed in a small hole in the bottom of the wall. it seems like the owner placed them there and intended to return but forgot where they were. The court in Benjamin v. Linder awarded carefully wrapped currency screwed into an airplance wall to the owner of the airplane (holding the prop was mislaid because the owner intended to return). The brewery will argue the coins were mislaid for the reasons stated above, in addition to the fact that the coins were wrapped in a bag from a store taht only opened 10 years ago. This indicates the prop is not treasure trove (which is awarded to a finder, good against all) because treasure trove must is typically old coins or currency buried in the soil so long ago that the owner is unkown/dead and/or will never come back. You should argue that the property was lost because no one would simply forget to come back for expensive gold coins. Next, we must discuss your growler and coat. A bailment is a transfer from bailor to bailee of temporary possession of an item. A bailment relationship implies a duty of reasonable care under the circumstances on teh part of the bailee. If there is such a relatioship, there is a presumption of negligence for lost/broken items. Hyatt Regency. Here, you should argue that you entered into a bailment with the brewery for your growler because the brewery fully possessed it and gave you a claim ticket with a nubmer on it, which gave you the reasonable expectation taht the brewery woudl return it to you and in the same condition. Further, there were bartenders who had it in their possession who work with glasses all day; it was not unreasonable for you to expect them not to drop and break it. Further, it was in an enclosed area -- behind the bar, which implies expectation of protection. The brewery will argue there was no bailment because it did not acquire full possession; you could have come in and taken it back at any point. A court would likely find there was a bailment for the growler. You might be able to bring an action for damages against the bailee. The coat is another story. The brewery will argue there was no bailement relationship for the coat beacuse it was placed on a communal coat hook, and thus, like an open parking lot, there is no expectation that the item would be protected from harm/theft. Further, there was no ticket for the coat. You should argue that there was a bailment because the restaurant was staffed and it was reasonable to expect that staff would keep an eye on items such as coats that customers brought in. A court would able to bring an action for damages against the bailee. The coat is another story. The brewery will argue there was no bailement relationship for the coat beacuse it was placed on a communal coat hook, and thus, like an open parking lot, there is no expectation that the item would be protected from harm/theft. Further, there was no ticket for the coat. You should argue that there was a bailment because the restaurant was staffed and it was reasonable to expect that staff would keep an eye on items such as coats that customers brought in. A court would likely find there is no bailment for the coat. Your out of luck. 1c. David had a fee simple sub. to exec. limitation. Fred and Frank (F & F) had an exec. interest in fee simple. Because Dvaid violated a condition (he started using the prop for commerical use), F & F's interest divested David's estate. F & F now have a fee simple absolute. However, the grant to F&F violates RAP because it is possible that David could violate the condition (""if it is ever used for non-res use"") more than 21 years after a life in being at the time of the grant. Thus, David has the prop in fee simple and there is nothing Alex or F&F can do. Ed got a fee simple subject to condition sub. (SCS) because the grant mixed language of determinable and SCS. When language is amibgous, as it is here (""so long as"" = duration = determinable; but ""right to re-enter"" = right of entry) courts prefer SCS because the present holder is less likely to lose the land. Thus, Alex had a right of entry, which he must assert if he wishes to take back his land if the condition is ever violated. Until Alex does assert his right, Ed still has possession even though he violated the condition. "," Tenancy by entirety (TE) prop can only be severed by divorce, death, mutual agreement. It cannot be transfered without agreement of spouse. Not subject to unilateral severance. It must be created by four unities in spouses, and there is a right of survivorship is in the surviving spouse. Since Andrew and Betty never divorced and never agreed to sell Greenacre to Chris, he obtained Greenacre under color of title. AP Debbie's best claim to Greenacre is by AP, which requires that the use be actual, continouos, exclusive, hostile, and open/notorious (O/N) for the 10 year statutory period of New Suffolk. Marengo; Pimental; unities in spouses, and there is a right of survivorship is in the surviving spouse.

AP Debbie's best claim to Greenacre is by AP, which requires that the use be actual, continouos, exclusive, hostile, and open/notorious (O/N) for the 10 year statutory period of New Suffolk. Marengo; Pimental; Cahill; Tieu. A claimaint may tack on years of a prior possessor if in privity. A voluntary, consensual transfer satisfies privity. Debbie must show that Chris' use meets the 5 elements for AP and that she can tack on his years. Actual use means that the claimant enters the property and uses it as a true owner would. Making improvements like Chris did by enlarging and insulating the cabin is an example of actual use. Further, Debbie built a house on the property. The use must be continous for the SOL period, which means that the claimant must control the prop uninterrupted consistent with the nature of the property. Greenacre was a hunting ground and fishing camp and although Chris did not occupy it year-round, such use is not required. He was there during fishing season and hunting, which is consistent with actual ownership. Debbie moved into her house full-time and lived there full-time after Chris' death as the SOL was about to expire (2011). The use must be exclusive, meaning the claimant ousts the true owner and strangers. Chris used the land to the exclusion the relevant owner (Betty). Permitting others onto the land is consistent with ownership (Marengo Cave), so Chris allowing neighors to hunt and fish does not violate the exclusivity requirement. An true owner is allowed to let others use his property. The use must be hostile, which requires at a minimum that the claimant not have permission of the true owner. Chris did not have Betty's permission because they never even met, and Betty only realized she owned the property until well after her husband's death. Some courts require good faith but mistaken belief the the property belongs to them. Tieu v. Morgan. Chris would pass in such a state because he believed the deed was valid. Some courts require bad faith element, meaning the claimant knew the land was not his and intended to violate the owner's right. (Maine test). Chris would fail such a test because he had good reason believe the land was his since Chris sold it to him. Most courts hold the claiman'ts state of mind is irrelevant (Cahill). Finally, use must be open/notorious. The test is whether the claimant's use puts the owner, after a reasonable inspection of her property, on actual or constructive notice that her rights are being violated. belief the the property belongs to them.

Here, Chris and Debbie made improvements to the land, and Chris fished and hunted on the land. Betty should have known that the land was being used by someone else, as all she had to do is drive up and see the house on her property. A claimant may claim the whole property under color of title, meaning the claimant relied on a defective instrument that he/she thought conveyed title to property but it did not. Further if the owner is absent (as Betty was here because she never even visited), the whole property the deed purported to convey goes to the claimant by AP. If Betty was present on some of the proeprty, Debbie could only claim as much as she was actually using. Debbie can tack on Chris' years because the will was a valid tranfer. Here, the deed was invalid because Andrew could not sever his TE. Betty's best argument is that Andrew could not sever the TE, and at Andrew's death she inherited his right of survivorship, making her the only owner of Greenacre. Betty might also argue that Chris' use was not ",646,2431,866
